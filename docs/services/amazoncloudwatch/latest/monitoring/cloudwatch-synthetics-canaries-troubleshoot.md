# Troubleshooting a failed canary

If your canary fails, check the following for troubleshooting.

**General troubleshooting**

- Use the canary details page to find more information. In the CloudWatch console, choose **Canaries** in the navigation pane and then choose the name of the canary to open
the canary details page. In the **Availability** tab, check the **SuccessPercent** metric to see whether the problem is constant or intermittent.

While still in the **Availability** tab, choose a failed data point
to see screenshots, logs, and step reports (if available) for that failed run.

If a step report is available because steps are part of your script, check to see
which
step has failed and see the associated screenshots to see the issue that your customers
are seeing.

You can also check the HAR files to see if one or more requests are failing. You can
dig deeper by
using logs to drill down on failed requests and errors. Finally, you can compare these
artifacts
with the artifacts from a successful canary run to pinpoint the issue.

By default, CloudWatch Synthetics captures screenshots for each step in a UI canary.
However, your script might be configured to disable screenshots. During debugging, you may
want to enable screenshots again. Similarly, for API canaries you might want to see HTTP
request and response headers and body during debugging. For information about how to
include this data in the report, see [executeHttpStep(stepName, requestOptions, \[callback\], \[stepConfig\])](cloudwatch-synthetics-canaries-library-nodejs.md#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_executeHttpStep).

- If you had a recent deployment to your application, roll it back and then debug later.

- Connect to your endpoint manually to see if you can reproduce the same issue.

## Canary fails after Lambda environment update

CloudWatch Synthetics canaries are implemented as Lambda functions in your account. These Lambda
functions are subject to regular Lambda runtime updates containing
security updates, bug fixes, and other improvements. Lambda strives to provide runtime
updates that are backward-compatible with existing functions. However, as
with software patching, there are rare cases in which a runtime update can negatively impact
an existing function. If you believe your
canary has been impacted by a Lambda runtime update, you can use the Lambda runtime management
manual mode (in supported Regions) to temporarily roll back the Lambda runtime version.
This keeps your canary function working and minimizes disruption, providing time to remedy
the incompatibility before returning to the latest runtime version.

If your canary is failing after a Lambda runtime update, the best solution is to upgrade
to one of the newest Synthetics runtimes. For more information about the latest runtimes,
see [Synthetics runtime versions](cloudwatch-synthetics-canaries-library.md).

As an alternative solution, in Regions where Lambda runtime management controls are
available, you can revert a canary back to an older
Lambda managed runtime, using manual mode for runtime management controls. You can set manual
mode using either the AWS CLI or by using the Lambda console, using
the steps below in the following sections.

###### Warning

When you change the runtime settings to manual mode, your Lambda function won't receive
automatic security updates until it is reverted back to
Auto mode. During this period, your Lambda function might be susceptible to security
vulnerabilities.

**Prerequisites**

- Install [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq)

- Install the latest version of the AWS CLI. For more information, see [AWS CLI\
install and update instructions](../../../cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.md#getting-started-install-instructions).

### Step 1: Obtain the Lambda function ARN

Run the following command to retrieve the `EngineArn` field from the
response. This `EngineArn` is the ARN of the Lambda function that is associated
with the canary. You will use this ARN in the following steps.

```nohighlight

aws synthetics get-canary --name my-canary | jq '.Canary.EngineArn'
```

Example output of `EngingArn`:

```nohighlight

"arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:cwsyn-my-canary-dc5015c2-db17-4cb5-afb1-EXAMPLE991:8"
```

### Step 2: Obtain the last good Lambda runtime version ARN

To help understand whether your canary was impacted by a Lambda runtime update, check
whether the date and time when the
Lambda runtime version ARN changes in your logs appeared to the date and time when you saw
impact to your canary. If they do not match,
it is probably not a Lambda runtime update that is causing your issues.

If your canary is impacted by a Lambda runtime update, you must identify the ARN of the
working Lambda runtime version that you were previously using. Follow the instructions in [Identifying\
runtime version changes](../../../lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-update.md#runtime-management-identify.html) to find the ARN of the
previous runtime. Record the runtime version ARN, and continue to Step 3. for setting the
runtime management configuration.

If your canary has not yet been impacted by a Lambda environment update, then you can
find the ARN of the Lambda runtime version that you are currently using. Run the following
command to retrieve the `RuntimeVersionArn` of the Lambda function from the
response.

```nohighlight

aws lambda get-function-configuration \
--function-name "arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:cwsyn-my-canary-dc5015c2-db17-4cb5-afb1-EXAMPLE991:8" | jq '.RuntimeVersionConfig.RuntimeVersionArn'
```

Example output of `RuntimeVersionArn`:

```nohighlight

"arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2::runtime:EXAMPLE647b82f490a45d7ddd96b557b916a30128d9dcab5f4972911ec0f"
```

### Step 3: Updating the Lambda runtime management configuration

You can use either the AWS CLI or the Lambda console to update the runtime management
configuration.

**To set Lambda runtime management configuration manual mode using the**
**AWS CLI**

Enter the following command to change the runtime management of the Lambda function to
manual mode. Be sure to replace the `function-name` and `
          qualifier` with the Lambda function ARN and Lambda function version number
respectively, using the values you found in Step 1. Also replace the the `
          runtime-version-arn` with the version ARN that you found in Step 2.

```nohighlight

aws lambda put-runtime-management-config \
    --function-name "arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:cwsyn-my-canary-dc5015c2-db17-4cb5-afb1-EXAMPLE991" \
    --qualifier 8 \
    --update-runtime-on "Manual" \
    --runtime-version-arn "arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2::runtime:a993d90ea43647b82f490a45d7ddd96b557b916a30128d9dcab5f4972911ec0f"
```

###### To change a canary to manual mode using the Lambda console

1. Open the AWS Lambda console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda).

2. Choose the **Versions** tab, choose the version number link that
    corresponds to your ARN, and choose the **Code** tab.

3. Scroll down to **Runtime settings**, expand **Runtime**
**management configuration**, and copy the the **Runtime version ARN**
    .

![Shows the Runtime settings section of the screen, and shows where the Runtime version ARN appears in this section.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/SyntheticsManual1.png)

4. Choose **Edit runtime management configuration**, choose **Manual**, paste the runtime version ARN that you copied earlier into the **Runtime**
**version ARN** field. Then choose **Save**.

![Shows the Runtime management configuration screen, and shows where the to paste the Runtime version ARN that you previousl copied..](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/SyntheticsManual2.png)

## My canary is blocked by AWS WAF

To allow canary traffic through AWS WAF,create a AWS WAF string match condition that allows
a custom string that you specify. For more information, see [Working with string\
match conditions](../../../waf/latest/developerguide/classic-web-acl-string-conditions.md) in the AWS WAF documentation.

We strongly
recommend that you use your own custom user-agent string instead of using default values.
This provides better control over
AWS WAF filtering and improves security.

To set a custom user-agent string, do the following:

- For Playwright runtimes, you can append your AWS WAF approved custom user-agent string
using the Synthetics configuration file. For more information, see [CloudWatch Synthetics configurations](synthetics-writingcanary-nodejs-playwright.md#Synthetics_canary_configure_Playwright_script).

- For Puppeteer or Selenium runtimes, you can add your custom user-agent string using
supported library functions. For Puppeteer runtimes, see [async addUserAgent(page, userAgentString);](cloudwatch-synthetics-canaries-library-nodejs.md#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_addUserAgent). For Selenium runtimes,
see [add\_user\_agent(user\_agent\_str)](cloudwatch-synthetics-canaries-library-python.md#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_add_user_agent).

## Waiting for an element to appear

After analyzing your logs and screenshots, if you see that your script is waiting for an
element to appear on screen and times out, check the relevant screenshot to see if the
element appears on the page. Verify your `xpath` to make sure that it is correct.

For Puppetteer-related issues, check [Puppeteer's GitHub page](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues) or internet forums.

## Node is either not visible or not an HTMLElement for page.click()

If a node is not visible or is not an `HTMLElement` for `page.click()`,
first verify the `xpath` that you are using to click the element. Also, if your
element is at the bottom of the screen, adjust your viewport. CloudWatch Synthetics by default
uses a viewport of 1920 \* 1080. You can set a different viewport when you launch the browser
or by using the Puppeteer function `page.setViewport`.

## Unable to upload artifacts to S3, Exception: Unable to fetch S3 bucket location: Access Denied

If your canary fails because of an Amazon S3 error, CloudWatch Synthetics was unable to upload
screenshots, logs, or reports created for the
canary because of permission issues. Check the following:

- Check that the canary's IAM role has the `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`
permission, the `s3:GetBucketLocation` permission for the correct Amazon S3
bucket, and the `s3:PutObject` permission for the bucket where the canary
stores its artifacts. If the canary performs visual monitoring, the role also needs the `
              s3:GetObject` permission for the bucket. These same permissions are also required
in the Amazon VPC S3 Gateway Endpoint Policy, if the canary is deployed in a VPC with a VPC
endpoint.

- If the canary uses an AWS KMS customer managed key for encryption instead of the standard AWS
managed key (default), the canary's IAM role might not have the permission to encrypt
or decrypt using that key. For more information, see [Encrypting canary artifacts](cloudwatch-synthetics-artifact-encryption.md).

- Your bucket policy might not allow the encryption mechanism that the canary uses.
For example,
if your bucket policy mandates to use a specific encryption mechanism or KMS key, then
you must select the same encryption mode for your canary.

If the canary performs visual monitoring, see [Updating artifact location and encryption when using visual monitoring](cloudwatch-synthetics-artifact-encryption.md#CloudWatch_Synthetics_artifact_encryption_visual) for more information.

## Error: Protocol error (Runtime.callFunctionOn): Target closed.

This error appears if there are some network requests after the page or browser is
closed. You might have forgotten to wait for an asynchronous operation. After executing your
script, CloudWatch Synthetics closes the browser. The execution of any asynchronous operation
after the browser is closed might cause `target closed error`.

## Canary Failed. Error: No datapoint - Canary Shows timeout error

This means that your canary run exceeded the timeout. The canary execution stopped
before
CloudWatch Synthetics could publish success percent CloudWatch metrics or update artifacts such as HAR
files,
logs and screenshots. If your timeout is too low, you can increase it.

By default, a canary timeout value is equal to its frequency. You can manually adjust
the timeout value to be less than or equal to the canary frequency. If your canary frequency
is low, you must increase the frequency to increase the timeout. You can adjust both the
frequency and the timeout value under **Schedule** when you create or
update a canary by using the CloudWatch Synthetics console.

Be sure that your canary timeout value is no shorter than
15 seconds to allow for Lambda cold starts and the time it takes to boot up the canary
instrumentation.

Canary artifacts are not available to view in the CloudWatch Synthetics console when this
error
happens. You can use CloudWatch Logs to see the canary's logs.

###### To use CloudWatch Logs to see the logs for a canary

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Log groups**.

3. Find the log group by typing the canary name in the filter box. Log groups for
    canaries have the name **/aws/lambda/cwsyn- `canaryName`**
**-randomId**.

## Trying to access an internal endpoint

If you want your canary to access an endpoint on your internal network, we recommend
that you set up CloudWatch Synthetics to use VPC. For more information, see [Running a canary on a VPC](cloudwatch-synthetics-canaries-vpc.md).

## Canary runtime version upgrade and downgrade issues

If you recently upgraded the canary from runtime version `syn-1.0` to a later
version, it may be a cross-origin request sharing (CORS) issue. For more information, see [Cross-origin request sharing (CORS) issue](#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_CORS).

If you recently downgraded the canary to an older runtime version, check to make sure
that the CloudWatch Synthetics functions that you are using are available in the older runtime
version that you downgraded to. For example, the `executeHttpStep` function is
available for runtime version `syn-nodejs-2.2` and later. To check on the
availability of functions, see [Writing a canary script](cloudwatch-synthetics-canaries-writingcanary.md).

###### Note

When you plan to upgrade or downgrade the runtime version for a canary, we recommend
that you
first clone the canary and update the runtime version in the cloned canary. Once you have
verified that the clone
with the new runtime version works, you can update the runtime version of your original
canary and delete the clone.

## Cross-origin request sharing (CORS) issue

In a UI canary, if some network requests are failing with `403` or `
        net::ERR_FAILED`, check whether the canary has active tracing enabled and also uses
the Puppeteer function `page.setExtraHTTPHeaders` to add headers. If so, the
failed network requests might be caused by cross-origin request sharing (CORS) restrictions.
You can confirm whether this is the case by disabling active tracing or removing the extra
HTTP headers.

**Why does this happen?**

When active tracing is used, an extra header is added to all outgoing requests to trace
the call. Modifying the request headers by adding a trace header or adding extra headers
using Puppeteer’s `page.setExtraHTTPHeaders` causes a CORS check for
XMLHttpRequest (XHR) requests.

If you don't want to disable active tracing or remove the extra headers, you can update
your web application to allow cross-origin access or you can disable web security by using
the `disable-web-security` flag when you launch the Chrome browser in your
script.

You can override launch parameters used by CloudWatch Synthetics and pass additional `
        disable-web-security` flag parameters by using the CloudWatch Synthetics launch function.
For more information, see [Library functions available for Node.js canary scripts using Puppeteer](cloudwatch-synthetics-canaries-library-nodejs.md).

###### Note

You can override launch parameters used by CloudWatch Synthetics when you use runtime
version `syn-nodejs-2.1` or later.

## Canary race condition issues

For the best experience when using CloudWatch Synthetics, ensure that the code written for the
canaries is idempotent. Otherwise, in rare cases,
canary runs may encounter race conditions when the canary interacts with the same resource
across different runs.

## Troubleshooting a canary on a VPC

If you have issues after creating or updating a canary on a VPC, one of the following
sections might
help you troubleshoot the problem.

### New canary in error state or canary can't be updated

If you create a canary to run on a VPC and it immediately goes into an error state, or
you can't update a canary to run on a VPC, the canary's role might not have the right
permissions. To run on a VPC, a canary must have the permissions `
          ec2:CreateNetworkInterface`, `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces`, and `
          ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface`. These permissions are all contained in the `
          AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole` managed policy. For more information, see [Execution Role and User\
Permissions](../../../lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.md#vpc-permissions).

If this issue happened when you created a canary, you must delete the canary, and
create a new one. If you use the CloudWatch console to create the new canary, under **Access**
**Permissions**, select **Create a new**
**role**. A new role that includes all permissions required to run the canary is
created.

If this issue happens when you update a canary, you can update the canary again
and provide a new role that has the required permissions.

### "No test result returned" error

If a canary displays a "no test result returned" error, one of the following issues
might be
the cause:

- If your VPC does not have internet access, you must use VPC endpoints to give the
canary access to CloudWatch and Amazon S3. You must enable the **DNS resolution**
and **DNS hostname** options in the VPC for these endpoint addresses
to resolve correctly. For more information, see [Using DNS with Your VPC](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.md) and [Using\
CloudWatch and CloudWatch Synthetics with interface VPC endpoints](cloudwatch-and-interface-vpc.md)
.

- Canaries must run in private subnets within a VPC. To check this, open the **Subnets** page in the VPC console. Check the subnets that you selected when
configuring the canary. If they have a path to an internet gateway ( **igw-**),
they are not private subnets.

To help you troubleshoot these issues, see the logs for the canary.

###### To see the log events from a canary

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Log groups**.

3. Choose the name of the canary's log group. The log group name starts with `
                 /aws/lambda/cwsyn-canary-name`.

## Troubleshooting an auto retry canary

To understand why your canary is failing or to analyze specific failed attempts, follow
these troubleshooting steps.

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Application Signals**, **Synthetics**
**Canaries**.

3. Choose the **Canary**.

4. Under the **Availability** tab, you can examine the run details by
    either:

- Selecting a specific point on the Canary Runs graph

- Under **Issues**, selecting a record. Note that retry attempts
are tagged and share timestamps with their scheduled runs

You can view additional information under **Steps**, **Screenshot**, **Logs**, **HAR file**, or **Traces**
**(if active tracing is enabled)**.

5. Under **Canary artifacts and Amazon S3 location**, you can access the
    artifact and navigate to the Amazon S3 folders or buckets through the available links.

6. The **Canary runs** graph uses different colored points to indicate
    various status:

- Blue Points – Indicates successful scheduled runs with a consistent value
of 100%

- Red Points – Displays failure of both scheduled runs and all retries,
marked at 0%

- Orange Points – Displays either 0% or 100%. 0% indicates ongoing retry
following previous attempt failures and 100% means success was achieved after
retrying
