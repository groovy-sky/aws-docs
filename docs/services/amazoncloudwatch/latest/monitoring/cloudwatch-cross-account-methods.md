# Monitor across accounts and Regions

To enable unified monitoring across accounts, CloudWatch offers the following features:

- **[CloudWatch\**
**cross-account observability](cloudwatch-unified-cross-account.md)**– facilitate
observability within a single Region with the Observability Access Manager (OAM)
service. You can link accounts and easily view metrics, logs, traces, and other
telemetry between accounts. This helps you to unify observability in central
monitoring accounts that view telemetry shared from source accounts, and operate on
this shared telemetry as if it were native to the monitoring account.

- **[Cross-account\**
**cross-Region CloudWatch console](cross-account-cross-region.md)**– delivers a console
experience that allows you to view dashboards, metrics, and alarms consoles of other
accounts across Regions by toggling between accounts. After you set up the necessary
permissions, you use an account selector integrated into the alarms, dashboards, and
metrics consoles to view metrics, dashboards, and alarms in other accounts without
having to log in and out of the accounts. By enabling this feature, you can also set
up dashboards that contain cross-account cross-Region metrics for centralized
visibility within an account.

- **[Cross-account cross-Region log centralization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatchLogs_Centralization.html)**–
collects copies of log data from multiple member accounts into one data repository
using cross-account and cross-region centralization rules. You define the rules that
automatically replicate log data from multiple accounts and AWS Regions into a
centralized account within your organization. This capability streamlines log
consolidation for improved centralized monitoring, analysis, and compliance across
your entire AWSinfrastructure.

These three features are complementary to each other and can be used independently or
together. See the following table for a comparison of the features. We recommend that you
use CloudWatch cross-account observability for the richest cross-account observability and
discovery experience within a Region for your metrics, logs, and traces.

**What is it?**

Unified access to underlying telemetry and other observability
resources across multiple accounts. After this is configured,
observability resources are seamlessly viewable between accounts,
eliminating the need for role assumptions. The central monitoring
account gains direct access to the telemetry data and resources from
source accounts, streamlining the monitoring and observability process.

A designated monitoring account assume a
**CrossAccountSharingRole** defined in source
accounts from the CloudWatch console. By assuming this role, the monitoring
account can invoke operations such as dashboard viewing on behalf of
source accounts, directly from its console.

Amazon CloudWatch Logs data centralization capability streamlines log consolidation for improved
centralized monitoring, analysis, and compliance across your entire
AWS infrastructure.

**How does it work?**

A monitoring account, using the Observability Access Monitoring
service, creates a _sink_ and attaches a sink policy
to it. The sink policy defines which resources they would like to view
and which source accounts should share them. Then source accounts can
create a link to the monitoring account sink, establishing what they
actually want to share. After the link is created, the specified
resources are visible in the monitoring account.

A source account initiates the configuration by setting up a
**CrossAccountSharingRole**, allowing a monitoring
account to run operations in the source account. Then, a monitoring
account enables the cross-account cross-Region selector in the console
by specifying the source account ID. This enables the monitoring account
to be able to switch into the source account. When switching, the CloudWatch
console checks for the existence of a service-linked role that allows
CloudWatch to assume the **CrossAccountSharingRole** that was
created in the source account.

Amazon CloudWatch Logs data centralization works with AWS Organizations to copy log data from
multiple member accounts into one data repository using cross-account and
cross-region centralization rules. You define the rules that automatically
replicate log data from multiple accounts and AWS Regions into a
centralized account within your organization.

**How many accounts can I use it**
**with?**

A monitoring account can see resources from as many as 100,000
source accounts at the same time. A source account can share their
resources with as many as five different monitoring
accounts.

By using the cross-account cross-Region selector in the console, a
monitoring account can switch to one other account at a time but there
is no limit on the number of accounts that can be linked. When defining
cross-account dashboards and alarms, many source accounts can be
referenced.

Works with AWS Organizations supported number of accounts

**Does it move telemetry**
**data?**

No. Resources are shared between accounts with the exception of
copied traces.

No. An IAM policy is configured to allow embedded account
switching for cross-account cross-Region resource
visibility.

Yes

**How much does it**
**cost?**

No extra charges for shared logs and metrics, and the first trace
copy is free. For more information about pricing, see [Amazon CloudWatch\
pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing).

No additional charges for cross-account or cross-Region
actions.

You can centralize one copy of logs for free. Additional copies are charged at $0.05/GB of
logs centralized (the backup region feature is considered an additional
copy). For information about storage cost pricing in the destination
account and other value-added experiences see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing).
