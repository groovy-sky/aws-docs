# Cross-account investigations

Cross-account CloudWatch investigations enables you to investigate application issues that span multiple
AWS accounts from a centralized monitoring account. This feature allows you to
correlate telemetry data, metrics, and logs across up to 25 accounts, in addition to the
monitoring account, to gain comprehensive visibility into distributed applications and
troubleshoot complex multi-account scenarios.

- [Investigating multi-account issues](#Investigations-cross-account-investigation)

## Prerequisites

- Multi-account investigation requires you to already have cross-account
observability set up in order to view cross-account telemetries. To complete
the prerequisite, set up either [cross-account observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/centralize-monitoring-by-using-amazon-cloudwatch-observability-access-manager.html) or the [cross-account dashboard](cross-account-cross-region.md).

- Setup an investigation group. For cross-account observability, this should
be in the monitoring account. You can also set them up in the source
accounts and run single account investigations there.

## Setup your monitoring account for cross-account access

###### Setup your monitoring account for cross-account access

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **AI Operations**,
    **Configuration**.

3. Under **Configure Cross-account access**, select
    **Configure**.

4. Add the Account ID for up to 25 accounts under the **List source**
**accounts** section.

5. Update your IAM role.
1. Automatically

- If you choose **Automatically update the assistant**
**role (recommended)**, this creates a customer
managed policy named
`AIOpsAssistantCrossAccountPolicy-${guid}`
that includes the `sts:AssumeRole` statements
needed to assume the assistant role in the specified source
accounts. Choosing the automatic update option defaults the
IAM role name to
`AIOps-CrossAccountInvestigationRole` in the
source accounts .
JSON

```json

{
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement": {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
          "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:iam::777777777777:role/AIOps-CrossAccountInvestigationRole",
              "arn:aws:iam::555555555555:role/AIOps-CrossAccountInvestigationRole",
              "arn:aws:iam::666666666666:role/AIOps-CrossAccountInvestigationRole"
          ]
      }
}

```

- If the monitoring account owner removes a source account
from the cross-account configuration, the IAM policy will
not update automatically. You must manually update the IAM
role and policy to ensure it always has the minimum
permissions possible.

- You might reach the limit of managed policies per role if
the permissions are not manually updated when a source
account is removed. You must delete any unused managed
policies attached to your investigation role.

2. Manually

- The following example shows the trust policy required for
the assistant role:
JSON

```json

{
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Sid": "AllowAIOpsAssumeRole",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Principal": {
                  "Service": "aiops.amazonaws.com"
              },
              "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
              "Condition": {
                  "StringEquals": {
                      "sts:ExternalId": "arn:aws:aiops:us-east-1:123456789012:investigation-group/AaBbcCDde1EfFG2g"
                  }
              }
          }
      ]
}

```

You can use the AWS CLI to create the custom source account
role and then attach the `AIOpsAssistantPolicy`
to the role using the following commands, replacing the
placeholder values with the appropriate values for your
environment:

```nohighlight

aws iam create-role
   --role-name custom-role-name
   --assume-role-policy-document
      '{
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
                   {
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Principal": { "AWS": "investigation-group-role-arn"
                            },
                        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
                        "Condition": {
                                   "StringEquals": {
                                            "sts:ExternalId": "investigation-group-arn"
                                              } } } ] }'

aws iam attach-role-policy
   --role-name custom-role-name
   --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AIOpsAssistantPolicy
```

- To grant cross-account access, the permission policy of
the assistant role in the monitoring account must contain
the following. If you are configuring the monitoring account
manually, the role name can be whatever you choose. It does
not default to
`AIOps-CrossAccountInvestigationRole`, make
sure to specify the name of the assistant role for each of
the source accounts.
JSON

```json

{
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement": {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
          "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:iam::777777777777:role/custom_source_account_role_name",
              "arn:aws:iam::555555555555:role/custom_source_account_role_name",
              "arn:aws:iam::666666666666:role/custom_source_account_role_name"
          ]
      }
}

```

- Use the AWS CLI to update the monitoring account
investigation group with the custom source account role ARN
using the following command, replacing the placeholder
values with the appropriate values for your environment:

```nohighlight

aws aiops update-investigation-group
   --identifier investigation-group-id
   --cross-account-configurations sourceRoleArn=sourceRoleArn1  sourceRoleArn=sourceRoleArn2
```

For more details on this command, see the [AWS CLI Command Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/aiops/update-investigation-group.html).

## Setup your source account(s) for cross-account access

1. Provision an IAM role with the name
    `AIOps-CrossAccountInvestigationRole` if you selected the
    **Automatically update the assistant role** option to
    set up the monitoring account. If you used the manual setup option,
    provision the IAM role with your customized source account role
    name.
1. Attach the AWS managed policy `AIOpsAssistantPolicy`
       to the role in the IAM console.

2. The trust policy of the role on the source account looks like
       this. `ExternalID` must be specified on the policy. Use
       the monitoring account investigation group ARN.
      JSON

      ```json

      {
          "Version":"2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Principal": {
                      "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/investigation-role-name"
                  },
                  "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
                  "Condition": {
                      "StringEquals": {
                          "sts:ExternalId": "investigation-group-arn"
                      }
                  }
              }
          ]
      }

      ```
2. This must be done in each of the source accounts.

3. If you set up the monitoring account role through the console, the role
    name of the source account defaults to
    `AIOps-CrossAccountInvestionRole`.

4. Confirm access by logging into the monitoring account, navigating to
    **Investigation Group**, then
    **Configuration**, and then choosing
    **Cross-account setup**.

Make sure the source account shows up in the cross-account configuration,
    and the status is **Linked to monitoring account**.

## Investigating multi-account issues

After you set up CloudWatch cross-account observability dashboard, you can view and
investigate from a cross-account telemetry in your monitoring account. You must add
a cross-account telemetry from the source account in order to run an investigation
into that source account.

For detailed information about how to create an investigation, see [Investigate operational issues in your environment](investigations-investigate.md).
