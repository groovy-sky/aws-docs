# Metrics Insights sample queries

This section contains examples of useful CloudWatch Metrics Insights queries that you can copy and use directly
or copy and modify in query editor. Some of these examples are already available in the
console, and you can access them by choosing **Add query** in the
**Metrics** view.

## Application Load Balancer examples
