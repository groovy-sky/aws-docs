# CloudWatch dashboard permissions update

On May 1, 2018, AWS changed the permissions required to access CloudWatch dashboards.
Dashboard access in the CloudWatch console now requires permissions that were introduced in
2017 to support dashboard API operations:

- **cloudwatch:GetDashboard**

- **cloudwatch:ListDashboards**

- **cloudwatch:PutDashboard**

- **cloudwatch:DeleteDashboards**

To access CloudWatch dashboards, you need one of the following:

- The **AdministratorAccess** policy.

- The **CloudWatchFullAccess** policy.

- A custom policy that includes one or more of these specific
permissions:

- `cloudwatch:GetDashboard` and
`cloudwatch:ListDashboards` to be able to view
dashboards

- `cloudwatch:PutDashboard` to be able to create or modify
dashboards

- `cloudwatch:DeleteDashboards` to be able to delete
dashboards
