# Install the CloudWatch agent with Prometheus metrics collection on Amazon EKS and Kubernetes clusters

This section explains how to set up the CloudWatch agent with Prometheus monitoring in a
cluster running Amazon EKS or Kubernetes. After you do this, the agent automatically scrapes
and imports metrics for the following workloads running in that cluster.

- AWS App Mesh

- NGINX

- Memcached

- Java/JMX

- HAProxy

- Fluent Bit

You can also configure the agent to scrape and import additional Prometheus
workloads and sources.

Before following these steps to install the CloudWatch agent for Prometheus metric
collection, you must have a cluster running on Amazon EKS or a Kubernetes cluster running on
an Amazon EC2 instance.

**VPC security group requirements**

The ingress rules of the security groups for the Prometheus workloads must open the
Prometheus ports to the CloudWatch agent for scraping the Prometheus metrics by the private
IP.

The egress rules of the security group for the CloudWatch agent must allow the CloudWatch agent
to connect to the Prometheus workloads' port by private IP.

- [Installing the CloudWatch agent to collect Prometheus metrics](#ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Setup-install-agent)

### Setting up IAM roles

The first step is to set up the necessary IAM role in the cluster. There are
two methods:

- Set up an IAM role for a service account, also known as a
_service role_. This method works for both the EC2 launch
type and the Fargate launch type.

- Add an IAM policy to the IAM role used for the cluster. This works only
for the EC2 launch type.

**Set up a service role (EC2 launch type and Fargate**
**launch type)**

To set up a service role, enter the following command. Replace
`MyCluster` with the name of the cluster.

```nohighlight

eksctl create iamserviceaccount \
 --name cwagent-prometheus \
--namespace amazon-cloudwatch \
 --cluster MyCluster \
--attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy \
--approve \
--override-existing-serviceaccounts
```

**Add a policy to the node group's IAM role (EC2 launch**
**type only)**

###### To set up the IAM policy in a node group for Prometheus support

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

3. You need to find the prefix of the IAM role name for the cluster. To do
    this, select the check box next to the name of an instance that is in the
    cluster, and choose **Actions**, **Security**,
    **Modify IAM Role**. Then copy the prefix of the IAM role,
    such as `eksctl-dev303-workshop-nodegroup`.

4. Open the IAM console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

5. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**.

6. Use the search box to find the prefix that you copied earlier in this
    procedure, and choose that role.

7. Choose **Attach policies**.

8. Use the search box to find **CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy**.
    Select the check box next to **CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy**,
    and choose **Attach policy**.

### Installing the CloudWatch agent to collect Prometheus metrics

You must install the CloudWatch agent in the cluster to collect the metrics. How to
install the agent differs for Amazon EKS clusters and Kubernetes clusters.

**Delete previous versions of the CloudWatch agent with Prometheus**
**support**

If you have already installed a version of the CloudWatch agent with Prometheus
support in your cluster, you must delete that version by entering the following
command. This is necessary only for previous versions of the agent with Prometheus
support. You do not need to delete the CloudWatch agent that enables Container Insights
without Prometheus support.

```

kubectl delete deployment cwagent-prometheus -n amazon-cloudwatch
```

#### Installing the CloudWatch agent on Amazon EKS clusters with the EC2 launch type

To install the CloudWatch agent with Prometheus support on an Amazon EKS cluster, follow
these steps.

###### To install the CloudWatch agent with Prometheus support on an Amazon EKS cluster

1. Enter the following command to check whether the
    `amazon-cloudwatch` namespace has already been
    created:

```

kubectl get namespace
```

2. If `amazon-cloudwatch` is not displayed in the results,
    create it by entering the following command:

```

kubectl create namespace amazon-cloudwatch
```

3. To deploy the agent with the default configuration and have it send data
    to the AWS Region that it is installed in, enter the following
    command:

```

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights/latest/k8s-deployment-manifest-templates/deployment-mode/service/cwagent-prometheus/prometheus-eks.yaml
```

To have the agent send data to a different Region instead, follow these
    steps:
1. Download the YAML file for the agent by entering the following
       command:

      ```

      curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights/latest/k8s-deployment-manifest-templates/deployment-mode/service/cwagent-prometheus/prometheus-eks.yaml
      ```

2. Open the file with a text editor, and search for the
       `cwagentconfig.json` block of the file.

3. Add the highlighted lines, specifying the Region that you want:

      ```nohighlight

      cwagentconfig.json: |
          {
            "agent": {
              "region": "us-east-2"
            },
            "logs": { ...

      ```

4. Save the file and deploy the agent using your updated file.

      ```

      kubectl apply -f prometheus-eks.yaml
      ```

#### Installing the CloudWatch agent on Amazon EKS clusters with the Fargate launch type

To install the CloudWatch agent with Prometheus support on an Amazon EKS cluster with the
Fargate launch type, follow these steps.

###### To install the CloudWatch agent with Prometheus support on an Amazon EKS cluster with the Fargate launch type

1. Enter the following command to create a Fargate profile for the CloudWatch
    agent so that it can run inside the cluster. Replace
    `MyCluster` with the name of the cluster.

```nohighlight

eksctl create fargateprofile --cluster MyCluster \
   --name amazon-cloudwatch \
   --namespace amazon-cloudwatch
```

2. To install the CloudWatch agent, enter the following command. Replace
    `MyCluster` with the name of the cluster. This name
    is used in the log group name that stores the log events collected by the
    agent, and is also used as a dimension for the metrics collected by the
    agent.

Replace `region` with the name of the Region
    where you want the metrics to be sent. For example, `us-west-1`.

```nohighlight

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights/latest/k8s-deployment-manifest-templates/deployment-mode/service/cwagent-prometheus/prometheus-eks-fargate.yaml |
sed "s/{{cluster_name}}/MyCluster/;s/{{region_name}}/region/" |
kubectl apply -f -
```

#### Installing the CloudWatch agent on a Kubernetes cluster

To install the CloudWatch agent with Prometheus support on a cluster running
Kubernetes, enter the following command:

```

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights/latest/k8s-deployment-manifest-templates/deployment-mode/service/cwagent-prometheus/prometheus-k8s.yaml |
sed "s/{{cluster_name}}/MyCluster/;s/{{region_name}}/region/" |
kubectl apply -f -

```

Replace `MyCluster` with the name of the cluster.
This name is used in the log group name that stores the log events collected by
the agent, and is also used as a dimension for the metrics collected by the
agent.

Replace `region` with the name of the AWS Region
where you want the metrics to be sent. For example,
`us-west-1`.

#### Verify that the agent is running

On both Amazon EKS and Kubernetes clusters, you can enter the following command to
confirm that the agent is running.

```

kubectl get pod -l "app=cwagent-prometheus" -n amazon-cloudwatch
```

If the results include a single CloudWatch agent pod in the `Running`
state, the agent is running and collecting Prometheus metrics. By default the CloudWatch
agent collects metrics for App Mesh, NGINX, Memcached, Java/JMX, and HAProxy every
minute. For more information about those metrics, see [Prometheus metrics collected by the CloudWatch agent](containerinsights-prometheus-metrics.md). For instructions on how
to see your Prometheus metrics in CloudWatch, see [Viewing your Prometheus metrics](containerinsights-prometheus-viewmetrics.md)

You can also configure the CloudWatch agent to collect metrics from other Prometheus
exporters. For more information, see [Scraping additional Prometheus sources and importing those metrics](containerinsights-prometheus-setup-configure.md).
