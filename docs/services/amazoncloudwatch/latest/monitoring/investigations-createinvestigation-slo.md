# Create an investigation from a CloudWatch Application Signals Service Level Objective (SLO)

You can start an investigation from a CloudWatch Application Signals Service Level Objective (SLO)
metric.

###### To start an investigation from a CloudWatch Application Signals Service Level Objective (SLO)

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. Navigate to the **Applications Signals (APM)**,
    **Service Level Objectives (SLO)** console page.

3. Select an entry from the **Service Level Objectives (SLO)**
    list to display the metrics available for that SLO.

4. Select a metric, then choose **Investigate** from the
    **Action** menu.

Alternatively, in the visualization of the metric you want to investigate,
    next to the more ![Vertical ellipsis used to display more options.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/vmore.png) menu, select the AI ![Icon used to represent a feature that uses artificial intelligence .](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/cw-ai-icon.png) icon to start an investigation.

If you have not configured operational investigations in your account, the
AI icon opens the **Operation troubleshooting** pane.
Select **Get started** to configure an investigation group
and then continue.

**title** enter a name for the investigation and optionally enter
    notes about the selected metric.

    timestamp to investigate based on the selected telemetry. To change the
    timestamp of the investigation, update the date and time.

7. Then choose **Start investigation**.

The investigation starts. CloudWatch investigations scans your telemetry data to find data that
    might be associated with this situation.
