# Collect Amazon EC2 instance store volume NVMe driver metrics

For CloudWatch agent to collect AWS NVMe driver metrics for instance store volumes attached to
an Amazon EC2 instance, add the `diskio` section inside the `metrics_collected`
section of the CloudWatch agent configuration file.

Additionally, the CloudWatch agent binary requires `ioctl` permissions for NVMe driver
devices to collect metrics from attached instance store volumes.

The following metrics can be collected.

MetricMetric name in CloudWatchDescription

`instance_store_total_read_ops`

`diskio_instance_store_total_read_ops`

The total number of completed read operations.

`instance_store_total_write_ops`
