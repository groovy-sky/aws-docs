# Starting the CloudWatch agent

You can start the CloudWatch agent using either Systems Manager Run Command or the command line.

For information about setting up the agent on a system that has security-enhanced Linux
(SELinux) enabled, see [Set up the CloudWatch agent with security-enhanced Linux (SELinux)](cloudwatch-agent-selinux.md).

## Start the CloudWatch agent using the command line on Amazon EC2

Follow these steps to use the command line to start the CloudWatch agent on on Amazon EC2.

###### To use the command line to start the CloudWatch agent on on Amazon EC2

1. Copy the agent configuration file that you want to use to the server where you're
    going to run the agent. Note the pathname where you copy it to.

2. In this command, `-a fetch-config` causes the agent to load the latest
    version of the CloudWatch agent configuration file, and `-s` starts the
    agent.

Enter one of the following commands. Replace
    `configuration-file-path` with the path to the agent
    configuration file. This file is called `config.json` if you created
    it with the wizard, and might be called
    `amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json` if you created it manually.

On an EC2 instance running Linux, enter the following command.

```nohighlight

sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -s -c file:configuration-file-path
```

On an on-premises server running Linux, enter the following:

```nohighlight

sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m onPremise -s -c file:configuration-file-path
```

On an EC2 instance running Windows Server, enter the following from the PowerShell
    console:

```nohighlight

& "C:\Program Files\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl.ps1" -a fetch-config -m ec2 -s -c file:configuration-file-path
```

On an on-premises server running Windows Server, enter the following from the
    PowerShell console:

```nohighlight

& "C:\Program Files\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl.ps1" -a fetch-config -m onPremise -s -c file:configuration-file-path
```

## Start the CloudWatch agent on an on-premises server

Follow these steps to start the CloudWatch agent on an on-premises server.

###### To use SSM Agent to start the CloudWatch agent on an on-premises server

1. Open the Systems Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Run Command**.

   -or-

If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens, scroll down and
    choose **Explore Run Command**.

3. Choose **Run command**.

4. In the **Command document** list, select the button next to
    **AmazonCloudWatch-ManageAgent**.

5. In the **Targets** area, select the instance where you installed
    the agent.

6. In the **Action** list, choose
    **configure**.

7. In the **Mode** list, choose **onPremise**.

8. In the **Optional Configuration Location** box, enter the name of
    the agent configuration file that you created with the wizard and stored in the
    Parameter Store.

9. Choose **Run**.

The agent starts with the configuration you specified in the configuration
    file.

###### To use the command line to start the CloudWatch agent on an on-premises server

- In this command, `-a fetch-config` causes the agent to load the latest
version of the CloudWatch agent configuration file, and `-s` starts the
agent.

Linux: If you saved the configuration file in the Systems Manager Parameter Store, enter the
following:

```nohighlight

sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m onPremise -s -c ssm:configuration-parameter-store-name
```

Linux: If you saved the configuration file on the local computer, enter the
following command. Replace `configuration-file-path` with the
path to the agent configuration file. This file is called
`config.json` if you created it with the wizard, and might be
called `amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json` if you created it
manually.

```nohighlight

sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m onPremise -s -c file:configuration-file-path

Windows Server: If you saved the agent configuration file in Systems Manager Parameter Store, enter
the following from the PowerShell console:

```nohighlight

& "C:\Program Files\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl.ps1" -a fetch-config -m onPremise -s -c ssm:configuration-parameter-store-name
