# Creating a CloudWatch cross-account cross-Region dashboard with the AWS Management Console

You can create _cross-account cross-Region dashboards_, which
summarize your CloudWatch data from multiple AWS accounts and multiple Regions into one
dashboard. From this high-level dashboard you can get a view of your entire application,
and also drill down into more specific dashboards without having to sign in and out of
accounts or switch Regions.

###### Prerequisite

Before you can create a cross-account cross-Region dashboard, you must enable at least one
sharing account and at least one monitoring account. Additionally, to be able to use the
CloudWatch console to create a cross-account dashboard, you must enable the console for
cross-account functionality. For more information, see [Cross-account cross-Region CloudWatch console](cross-account-cross-region.md).

###### To create a cross-account cross-Region dashboard

1. Sign in to the monitoring account.

2. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Dashboards**.

4. Choose a dashboard, or create a new one.

5. At the top of the screen, you can switch between accounts and Regions.
    As you create your dashboard, you can include widgets from multiple
    accounts and Regions. Widgets include graphs, alarms, and CloudWatch Logs Insights
    widgets.
