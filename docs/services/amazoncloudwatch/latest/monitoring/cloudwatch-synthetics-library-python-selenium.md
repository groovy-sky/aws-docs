# Runtime versions using Python and Selenium Webdriver

The following sections contain information about the CloudWatch Synthetics runtime versions
for Python and Selenium Webdriver. Selenium is an open-source browser automation tool. For
more information about Selenium, see [www.selenium.dev/](https://www.selenium.dev/)

For features and methods supported by Synthetics runtime on Selenium framework, see [Python\
and Selenium library classes and functions that apply to UI canaries only](cloudwatch-synthetics-canaries-library-python.md#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_Python_UIcanaries)
and [Selenium API\
reference](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/py/api.html).

The naming convention for these runtime versions is `syn-language
          -framework-majorversion.
          minorversion`.

- Selenium 3.141.0

- Chromium version 83.0.4103.0

**Features**:

- **Custom handler function**— You can now
use a custom handler function for your canary scripts. Previous runtimes
required the script entry point to include `.handler`.

You can also put canary scripts in any folder and pass the folder name as
part of the handler. For example, `MyFolder/MyScriptFile.functionname`
can be used as an entry point.

- **Configuration options for adding metrics and step**
**failure**
**configurations**— These options were already available in
runtimes for Node.js canaries. For more information, see [SyntheticsConfiguration class](cloudwatch-synthetics-canaries-library-python.md#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_SyntheticsConfiguration_Python)
.

- **Custom arguments in Chrome**— You can
now open a browser in incognito mode or pass in proxy server configuration. For
more information, see [Chrome()](cloudwatch-synthetics-canaries-library-python.md#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_Python_Chrome).

canary can store its artifacts in an Amazon S3 bucket in a different Region.

- **Bug fixes, including a fix for the `index.py`**
**issue**— With previous runtimes, a canary file named `
                      index.py` caused exceptions because it conflicted with the name of the
library file. This issue is now fixed.
