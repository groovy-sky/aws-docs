# Receive notifications for detected problems

You can use Amazon SNS notifications, Systems Manager OpsCenter, or CloudWatch Events to receive notifications about problems that are detected in your applications.

###### CloudWatch Application Insights Amazon SNS notifications for detected problems

You can configure Amazon SNS notifications using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI. To set up notifications using the AWS Management Console, you must have the necessary Amazon SNS permissions as shown in
the following example.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "sns:ListTopics",
          "sns:Subscribe",
          "sns:CreateTopic"
        ],
        "Resource": [
          "*"
        ]
      }
    ]
}

```

After you set up Amazon SNS notifications, you receive email notifications when a problem is created or resolved. You also receive
notifications when a new observation is added to an existing problem.

The following example shows the content of an email notification.

###### How to receive problem notifications using Systems Manager

**Actions through AWS Systems Manager.** CloudWatch Application Insights provides
built-in integration with Systems Manager OpsCenter. If you choose to use this
integration for your application, an OpsItem is created on the OpsCenter console
for every problem detected with the application. From the OpsCenter console, you
can view summarized information about the problem detected by CloudWatch Application Insights and pick a
Systems Manager Automation runbook to take remedial actions or further identify
Windows processes that are causing resource issues in your application.

###### How to receive problem notifications using CloudWatch Events

From the CloudWatch console, select **Rules** under
**Events** in the left navigation pane. From
the **Rules** page, select **Create rule**. Choose **Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights**
from the **Service Name** dropdown list and choose
the **Event Type**. Then, choose **Add target** and select the target and parameters, for
example, an **SNS topic** or **Lambda function**.
