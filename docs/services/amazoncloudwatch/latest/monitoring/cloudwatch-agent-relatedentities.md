# Using the CloudWatch agent with related telemetry

Metrics and logs that are sent to CloudWatch can include an optional entity to correlate
telemetry. Entities are used in the [Explore related](explorerelated.md)
pane. The CloudWatch agent sends entities with a service name and environment name included.

The agent chooses the service name and environment name from the following data.

**Service name**

The agent chooses the service name from the following options, in priority order:

- **Application Signals instrumentation** – The
agent sends the service name used by Application Signals. This can be overwritten by
changing the `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` environment variable used by supported
OpenTelemetry instrumentation libraries.

- **CloudWatch agent configuration** – You can [configure the agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-configure-related-telemetry.html) to use
a specific service name. This can be configured at the agent, plugin, metrics, logs, or
log file level.

- **Kubernetes workload name** – For Kubernetes
workloads, the agent sends the name of the workload for the corresponding pod, in the
following priority order.

- Deployment name

- ReplicaSet name

- StatefulSet name

- DaemonSet name

- CronJob name

- Job name

- Pod name

- Container name

- **Resource tags from instance metadata** – For
Amazon EC2 workloads, the agent sends the a name from tags, in the following order.

- service

- application

- app

You must [setup instance metadata](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/work-with-tags-in-imds.md#allow-access-to-tags-in-IMDS) for the agent to be able to access tags.

- **Default** – If no other service name is found,
the agent will send the name `Unknown`.

**Environment name**

The agent chooses the environment name from the following options, in priority
order:

- **Application Signals instrumentation** – The
agent sends the environment name used by Application Signals. This can be overwritten by
setting a `deployment.environment` environment variable used by supported
OpenTelemetry instrumentation libraries. For example, applications may set the environment
variable
`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=deployment.environment=MyEnvironment`.

- **CloudWatch agent configuration** – You can [configure the agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-configure-related-telemetry.html) to use
a specific environment name. This can be configured at the agent, plugin, metrics, logs,
or log file level.

- **Cluster name and workspace** – For Amazon EKS,
`eks:cluster-name/Namespace`.
For native Kubernetes running on Amazon EC2,
`k8s:cluster-name/Namespace`.

- **Resource tags from instance metadata** – For
Amazon EC2 workloads, the agent can will use the `AutoScalingGroup` tag.

You must [setup instance metadata](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/work-with-tags-in-imds.md#allow-access-to-tags-in-IMDS) for the agent to be able to access tags.

- By default, Amazon EC2 instances that aren't running Kubernetes will get the environment
name `ec2:default`.
