# How partial data is handled

## How partial data from a Metrics Insights query is evaluated

If the Metrics Insights query used for the alarm matches more than 10,000 metrics, the
alarm is evaluated based on the first 10,000 metrics that the query finds. This means that
the alarm is being evaluated on partial data.

You can use the following methods to find whether a Metrics Insights alarm is currently
evaluating its alarm state based on partial data:

- In the console, if you choose an alarm to see the **Details** page,
the message **Evaluation warning: Not evaluating all data** appears on
that page.

- You see the value `PARTIAL_DATA` in the `EvaluationState`
field when you use the [describe-alarms](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudwatch/describe-alarms.html?highlight=describe+alarms) AWS CLI command or the [DescribeAlarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAlarms.html) API.

Alarms also publish events to Amazon EventBridge when it goes into the partial data state, so you
can create an EventBridge rule to watch for these events. In these events, the
`evaluationState` field has the value `PARTIAL_DATA`. The following
is an example.

                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

If the query for the alarm includes a GROUP BY statement that initially returns more
than 500 time series, the alarm is evaluated based on the first 500 time series that the
query finds. However, if you use an ORDER BY clause, then all the time series that the query
finds are sorted, and the 500 that have the highest or lowest values according to your ORDER
BY clause are used to evaluate the alarm.

## How partial data from a multi data source alarm is evaluated

If the Lambda function returns partial data:

- The alarm continues to be evaluated on the data points that are
returned.

- You can use the following methods to find whether an alarm on a Lambda function
is currently evaluating its alarm state based on partial data:

- In the console, choose an alarm and choose the
**Details** page. If you see the message
**Evaluation warning: Not evaluating all data appears on that**
**page**, it is evaluating on partial data.

- If you see the value `PARTIAL_DATA` in the
`EvaluationState` field when you use the
`describe-alarms` AWS CLI command or the DescribeAlarms API, it is
evaluating on partial data.

- An alarm also publishes events to Amazon EventBridge when it goes into the partial data
state.
