## addExecutionError(errorMessage, ex);

`errorMessage` describes the error and `ex` is the exception
that is encountered

You can use `addExecutionError` to set execution errors for your canary.
It fails the canary without interrupting the script execution. It also doesn't impact
your `successPercent` metrics.

You should track errors as execution errors only if they are not important to
indicate
the success or failure of your canary script.

An example of the use of `addExecutionError` is the following. You are
monitoring the availability of your endpoint and taking screenshots after the page has
loaded. Because the failure of taking a screenshot doesn't determine availability of the
endpoint, you can catch any errors encountered while taking screenshots and add them as
execution errors. Your availability metrics will still indicate that the endpoint is up
and running, but your canary status will be marked as failed. The following sample code
block catches such an error and adds it as an execution error.

```nodejs

try {await synthetics.executeStep(stepName, callbackFunc);} catch(ex) {synthetics.addExecutionError('Unable to take screenshot ', ex);}
```

## getCanaryName();

Returns the name of the canary.

## getCanaryArn();

Returns the ARN of the canary.

## getCanaryUserAgentString();

Returns the custom user agent of the canary.

## getRuntimeVersion();

This function is available on runtime version `syn-nodejs-3.0` and later.
It returns the Synthetics runtime version of the canary. For example, the return value
could be `syn-nodejs-3.0`.

## getLogLevel();

Retrieves the current log level for the Synthetics library. Possible values are the
following:

- `0` – Debug

- `1` – Info

- `2` – Warn

- `3` – Error

Example:

```

let logLevel = synthetics.getLogLevel();
```

## setLogLevel();

Sets the log level for the Synthetics library. Possible values are the following:

- `0` – Debug

- `1` – Info

- `2` – Warn

- `3` – Error

Example:

```

synthetics.setLogLevel(0);
```

## executeStep(stepName, functionToExecute, \[stepConfig\])

Executes the provided step, wrapping it with start/pass/fail logging and pass/fail
and duration metrics.

The `executeStep` function also does the following:

- Logs that the step started

- Starts a timer

- Executes the provided function

- When the function returns normally, it counts as passing. If the function
throws, it counts as failing

- Ends the timer

- Logs whether the step passed or failed

- Emits the `stepName SuccessPercent` metric, 100 for pass or 0 for
failure

- Emits the `stepName Duration metric`, with a value based on the step
start and end times

- Returns what the functionToExecute returned or re-throws what `
                  functionToExecute` threw

- Adds a step execution summary to the canary's report

**Example**

```

await synthetics.executeStep(stepName, async function () {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        const req = https.request(url, (res) => {
            console.log(`Status: ${res.statusCode}`);
            if (res.statusCode >= 400) {
                reject(new Error(`Request failed with status ${res.statusCode} for ${url}`));
            } else {
                resolve();
            }
        });

        req.on('error', (err) => {
            reject(new Error(`Request failed for ${url}: ${err.message}`));
        });

        req.end();
    });
});
```

## executeHttpStep(stepName, requestOptions, \[callback\], \[stepConfig\])

Executes the provided HTTP request as a step, and publishes `SuccessPercent`
(pass/fail) and `Duration` metrics.

**executeHttpStep** uses either HTTP or HTTPS native functions
under the hood, depending upon the protocol specified in the request.

This function also adds a step execution summary to the canary's report. The
summary includes details about each HTTP request, such as the following:

- Start time

- End time

- Status (PASSED/FAILED)

- Failure reason, if it failed

- HTTP call details such as request/response headers, body, status code,
status message, and performance timings.

- [Examples of using executeHttpStep](#Library_function_Nodejs_executeHttpStep_examples_Nodecanary)

### Parameters

**stepName( `String`)**

Specifies the name of the step. This name is also used for publishing
CloudWatch metrics for this step.

**requestOptions( `Object or String`)**

The value of this parameter can be a URL, a URL string, or an object. If it is an
object, then it must be a set of configurable options to make an HTTP request. It
supports all options in [http.request(options\[, callback\])](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) in the Node.js documentation.

In addition to these Node.js options, **requestOptions** supports
the additional parameter `body`. You can use the `body`
parameter to pass data as a request body.

**callback( `response`)**

(Optional) This is a user function which is invoked with the HTTP response. The
response is of the type [Class: http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html).

**stepConfig( `object`)**

(Optional) Use this parameter to override global synthetics configurations with a
different configuration for this step.

### Examples of using executeHttpStep

The following series of examples build on each other to illustrate the various
uses
of this option.

This first example configures request parameters. You can pass a URL as **requestOptions**:

```nodejs

let requestOptions = 'https://www.amazon.com';
```

Or you can pass a set of options:

```nodejs

let requestOptions = {
        'hostname': 'myproductsEndpoint.com',
        'method': 'GET',
        'path': '/test/product/validProductName',
        'port': 443,
        'protocol': 'https:'
    };
```

The next example creates a callback function which accepts a response. By default,
if you do not specify **callback**, CloudWatch Synthetics validates that
the status is between 200 and 299 inclusive.

```nodejs

// Handle validation for positive scenario
    const callback = async function(res) {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            if (res.statusCode < 200 || res.statusCode > 299) {
                throw res.statusCode + ' ' + res.statusMessage;
            }

            let responseBody = '';
            res.on('data', (d) => {
                responseBody += d;
            });

            res.on('end', () => {
                // Add validation on 'responseBody' here if required. For ex, your status code is 200 but data might be empty
                resolve();
            });
        });
    };
```

The next example creates a configuration for this step that overrides
the global CloudWatch Synthetics configuration. The step configuration in this example
allows request headers, response headers, request body (post data), and response body
in your report and restrict 'X-Amz-Security-Token' and 'Authorization' header values.
By default, these values are not included in the report for security reasons.
If you choose to include them, the data is only stored in your S3 bucket.

```nodejs

// By default headers, post data, and response body are not included in the report for security reasons.
// Change the configuration at global level or add as step configuration for individual steps
let stepConfig = {
    includeRequestHeaders: true,
    includeResponseHeaders: true,
    restrictedHeaders: ['X-Amz-Security-Token', 'Authorization'], // Restricted header values do not appear in report generated.
    includeRequestBody: true,
    includeResponseBody: true
};
```

This final example passes your request to **executeHttpStep** and
names the step.

```nodejs

await synthetics.executeHttpStep('Verify GET products API', requestOptions, callback, stepConfig);
```

With this set of examples, CloudWatch Synthetics adds the details from each step in your
report and produces metrics for each step using **stepName**.

You will see `successPercent` and `duration` metrics for
the `Verify GET products API` step. You can monitor your API performance by
monitoring the metrics for your API call steps.
