# Create an account-level field index policy

Use the steps in this section to create a field index policy that applies to all
log groups in the account, or to multiple log groups that have log group names that
start with the same string.

###### To create an account-level field index policy

01. Open the CloudWatch console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

02. In the left navigation pane, choose **Settings** and then
     choose the **Logs** tab.

03. In the **Account level index policies** section, choose
     **Manage**.

04. Choose **Create index policy**.

05. For **Policy name**, enter a name for your new
     policy.

06. For **Select scope of policy**, do one of the
     following:
    - Choose **All standard log groups** to have the
       index policy apply to all Standard Class log groups in the
       account.

    - Choose **Log groups by prefix match** to apply
       the policy to a subset of log groups that all have names that start
       with the same string. Then, enter the prefix for these log groups in
       **Enter a prefix name**.

      After you enter your prefix, you can choose **Preview**
      **prefix matched log groups** to confirm that your prefix
       matches the log groups that you expected.

      Choose **Logs Data by Data source**
       to apply the policy to a specific data source name and type
       combination. You can then select the **Data**
      **source** and **Data type**
       from the drop-down menu.

      After you select the data source name and type you can select
       **Get fields** to populate the
       **Configure field indexes and**
      **facets** section with relevant information such as the
       fields available, included log groups, as well as default and custom
       field indexes.
07. For **Custom index field configuration**, choose
     **Add field path** to enter the first field to
     index.

    Then enter the string to use as the value of the field name or select a
     field from the drop-down menu. This must be an exact case match to what
     appears in the log events. For example, if your log events include
     `requestId`, you must enter `requestId` here.
     `RequestId`, `requestID`, and `request
                                Id` wouldn't match.

    If you want to index a custom log field that starts with the
     `@` character, you must include an extra `@`
     character when you enter the index string. For example, if you have a custom
     log field `@emailname`, enter `@@emailname` in the
     **Add field path** box.

    You can also create indexes for the `@ingestionTime` and
     `@logStream` fields that CloudWatch Logs automatically generates. If
     you do, you don't need to add an extra `@` when specifying
     them.

08. (Optional)In addition to specifying the field path, you can select
     **Set as a facet** to create the field as a
     facet.

09. Repeat the previous step to add as many as 20 field indexes.

10. When you have finished, choose **Create**.
