# subqueries

A subquery is a nested Logs Insights query that can be used as an input to
another query. Subqueries can be used to derive intermediate result sets that are
then consumed by subsequent commands.

###### Syntax

###### Subquery in filter

```nohighlight

filter <field> in (
    <subquery>
)
```

###### Parameters

- `<subquery>` – A valid Logs Insights query that
returns a result set. The subquery must produce fields referenced by the
outer query.

###### Examples

###### Example 1: Find requests that encountered errors in downstream services

This example shows how to use a subquery to identify requests in your main
service that resulted in errors in a downstream service. This is useful for
troubleshooting cascading failures in distributed systems.

```nohighlight

filter requestId in (
    SOURCE '/aws/lambda/database-service'
    | filter errorType = "DatabaseConnectionTimeout"
    | fields requestId
)
| fields @timestamp, requestId, endpoint, userId, responseTime
| sort @timestamp desc
```

This query:

1. The subquery finds all `requestId` values from the database
    service that experienced connection timeouts

2. The outer query filters your main service's logs to show only
    requests that match those error-prone request IDs

3. Results show the full context of requests that failed downstream,
    including which endpoints and users were affected

This pattern helps you understand the upstream impact of downstream failures.

###### Example 2: Identify frequently failing requests for targeted investigation

This example demonstrates using a subquery with aggregation to find requests
that fail repeatedly, which often indicates systematic issues rather than
transient errors.

```nohighlight

filter requestId in (
    SOURCE '/aws/lambda/payment-processor'
    | filter status = "FAILED"
    | stats count(*) as failureCount by requestId
    | filter failureCount > 3
    | fields requestId
)
| fields @timestamp, requestId, customerId, amount, failureReason
| sort @timestamp asc
```

This query:

1. The subquery aggregates failed payment attempts and identifies
    request IDs that failed more than 3 times

2. The outer query retrieves all log events for those problematic
    request IDs

3. Results are sorted chronologically to show the progression of
    retry attempts

This helps distinguish between transient failures (single occurrence) and
persistent issues (multiple failures) that require deeper investigation.

###### Behavior

- Subqueries are executed independently of the outer query.

- Results are materialized before being consumed by the outer query.

- Only fields explicitly selected in the subquery are available to the outer query.

###### Notes and limitations

- Subqueries must return fields referenced by the outer query.

- Nested subqueries are not supported.

- Subqueries may increase query execution time and cost.

- Correlated subqueries are not supported.

- Inner query execution is limited to 30 seconds.
