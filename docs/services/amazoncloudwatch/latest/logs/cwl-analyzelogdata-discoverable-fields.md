# Supported logs and discovered fields

CloudWatch Logs Insights supports different log types. For every log that's sent to a Standard class
log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Logs Insights automatically generates five system fields:

- `@message` contains the raw unparsed log event. This is the
equivalent to the `message` field in [InputLogevent](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatchlogs/latest/apireference/api-inputlogevent.md).

- `@timestamp` contains the event timestamp in the log event's
`timestamp` field. This is the equivalent to the
`timestamp` field in [InputLogevent](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatchlogs/latest/apireference/api-inputlogevent.md).

- `@ingestionTime` contains the time when CloudWatch Logs received the log
event.

- `@logStream` contains the name of the log stream that the log event
was added to. Log streams group logs through the same process that generated
them.

- `@log` is a log group identifier in the form of
`account-id:log-group-name`.
When querying multiple log groups, this can be useful to identify which log
group a particular event belongs to.

- `@entity` contains flattened JSON related to entities for the
[Explore related\
telemetry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ExploreRelated.html) feature.

For example, this JSON can represent an entity.

```json

{
    "Entity": {
      "KeyAttributes": {
        "Type": "Service",
        "Name": "PetClinic"
      },
      "Attributes": {
        "PlatformType": "AWS::EC2",
        "EC2.InstanceId": "i-1234567890123"
      }
    }
}
```

For this entity, the extracted system fields would be the following:

```nohighlight

@entity.KeyAttributes.Type = Service
@entity.KeyAttributes.Name = PetClinic
@entity.Attributes.PlatformType = AWS::EC2
@entity.Attributes.EC2.InstanceId = i-1234567890123
```

###### Note

Field discovery is supported only for log groups in the Standard log class. For
more information about log classes, see [Log classes](cloudwatch-logs-log-classes.md).

CloudWatch Logs Insights inserts the **@** symbol at the start of fields that it
generates.

For many log types, CloudWatch Logs also automatically discovers the log fields contained in the
logs. These automatic discovery fields are shown in the following table.

For other types of logs with fields that CloudWatch Logs Insights doesn't automatically discover, you
can use the `parse` command to extract and create extracted fields for use in
that query. For more information, see [CloudWatch Logs Insights language query syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax.html).

If the name of a discovered log field starts with the `@` character,
CloudWatch Logs Insights displays it with an additional `@` appended to the beginning. For
example, if a log field name is `@example.com`, this field name is displayed
as `@@example.com`.

###### Note

Except for `@message`, `@timestamp`, or `@log`,
you can create field indexes for discovered fields. For more information about field
indexes, see [Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce scan volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatchLogs-Field-Indexing.html).

`version`, `action`, `bytes`,
`dstAddr`, `dstPort`,
`packets`, `protocol`, `srcAddr`,

`queryTimestamp`, `queryType`,
`resolverIp`, `responseCode`,

Lambda logs

`@timestamp`, `@logStream`,
`@message`, `@requestId`, `@duration,
                                    ` `@billedDuration`, `@type`,
`@maxMemoryUsed`, `@memorySize`

If a Lambda log line contains an X-Ray trace ID, it also includes
the following fields: `@xrayTraceId` and
`@xraySegmentId`.

CloudWatch Logs Insights automatically discovers log fields in Lambda logs, but only
for the first embedded JSON fragment in each log event. If a Lambda
log event contains multiple JSON fragments, you can parse and
extract the log fields by using the `parse` command. For more information, see
[Fields in JSON logs](#CWL_AnalyzeLogData-discoverable-JSON-logs).

## Fields in JSON logs

With CloudWatch Logs Insights, you use dot notation to represent JSON fields. This section contains
an example JSON event and code snippet that show how you can access JSON fields
using dot notation.

**Example: JSON event**

```JSON

{
    "eventVersion": "1.0",
    "userIdentity": {
        "type": "IAMUser",
        "principalId": "EX_PRINCIPAL_ID",
        "arn": "arn: aws: iam: : 123456789012: user/Alice",
        "accessKeyId": "EXAMPLE_KEY_ID",
        "accountId": "123456789012",
        "userName": "Alice"
    },
    "eventTime": "2014-03-06T21: 22: 54Z",
    "eventSource": "ec2.amazonaws.com",
    "eventName": "StartInstances",
    "awsRegion": "us-east-2",
    "sourceIPAddress": "192.0.2.255",
    "userAgent": "ec2-api-tools1.6.12.2",
    "requestParameters": {
        "instancesSet": {
            "items": [
                {
                    "instanceId": "i-abcde123"
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    "responseElements": {
        "instancesSet": {
            "items": [
                {
                    "instanceId": "i-abcde123",
                    "currentState": {
                        "code": 0,
                        "name": "pending"
                    },
                    "previousState": {
                        "code": 80,
                        "name": "stopped"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

The example JSON event contains an object that's named `userIdentity`.
`userIdentity` contains a field that's named `type`. To
represent value of `type` using dot notation, you use
`userIdentity.type`.

The example JSON event contains arrays that flatten to lists of nested field names
and values. To represent the value of `instanceId` for the first item in
`requestParameters.instancesSet`, you use
`requestParameters.instancesSet.items.0.instanceId`. The number
`0` that's placed before the field `instanceID` refers to
the position of values for the field `items`. The following example
contains a code snippet that shows how you can access nested JSON fields in a JSON
log event.

**Example: Query**

```nohighlight

fields @timestamp, @message
| filter requestParameters.instancesSet.items.0.instanceId="i-abcde123"
| sort @timestamp desc
```

The code snippet shows a query that uses dot notation with the `filter`
command to access the value of the nested JSON field `instanceId`. The
query filters on messages where the value of `instanceId` equals
`"i-abcde123"` and returns all of the log events that contain the
specified value.

###### Note

CloudWatch Logs Insights can extract a maximum of 200 log event fields from a JSON log. For
additional fields that aren't extracted, you can use the `parse`
command to extract the fields from the raw unparsed log event in the message
field. For more information about the `parse` command, see [Query syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax.html) in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
