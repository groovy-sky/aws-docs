# Configuring S3 destinations for scheduled queries

Configure Amazon S3 as a destination to store your scheduled query results as JSON
files for long-term retention and analysis.

When using Amazon S3 as a destination, query results are stored as JSON files in the
specified bucket and prefix. This option is ideal for archiving results, performing
batch analysis, or integrating with other AWS services that process S3 data.

You can deliver query results to an Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS account as the
scheduled query or to a bucket in a different AWS account. You can also optionally
encrypt query results using a customer managed AWS KMS key (SSE-KMS).

## Delivering results to an Amazon S3 bucket in the same account

When the destination Amazon S3 bucket is in the same AWS account as the scheduled
query, you can browse and select the bucket directly from the console.

###### To configure a same-account Amazon S3 destination (console)

1. In the **Post query results to S3** section, for
    **S3 bucket**, select **This**
**account**.

2. For **Amazon S3 URI**, enter the Amazon S3 bucket and prefix where
    results will be stored (for example,
    `s3://my-bucket/query-results/`), or choose
    **Browse Amazon S3** to navigate and select an existing Amazon S3
    location.

3. (Optional) To encrypt results with a customer managed AWS KMS key, enter the
    ARN of the AWS KMS key in the **KMS key ARN** field. The key
    must be in the same AWS Region as the destination Amazon S3 bucket. If you
    don't specify a AWS KMS key, the bucket's default encryption settings
    apply.

4. In the **IAM role for posting query results to**
**Amazon S3** section, choose **Auto-create a new role with**
**default permissions** to automatically set up the required
    permissions, or choose **Use an existing role** to select
    an existing IAM role with the required policies.

The destination delivery IAM role requires the following permissions:

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/prefix/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:ResourceAccount": "111122223333"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Delivering results to an Amazon S3 bucket in another account

You can deliver scheduled query results to an Amazon S3 bucket in a different AWS
account. When using a cross-account bucket, you must provide the Amazon S3 URI and the
account ID of the bucket-owning account.

###### To configure a cross-account Amazon S3 destination (console)

1. In the **Post query results to S3** section, for
    **S3 bucket**, select **Another**
**account** and provide the account ID of the bucket-owning account as input.

2. For **Amazon S3 URI**, enter the full Amazon S3 URI of the
    destination bucket and prefix in the other account (for example,
    `s3://cross-account-bucket/query-results/`).

3. (Optional) To encrypt results with a customer managed AWS KMS key, enter the
    ARN of the AWS KMS key in the **KMS key ARN** field. The key
    must be in the same AWS Region as the destination Amazon S3 bucket.

4. In the **IAM role for posting query results to**
**Amazon S3** section, choose **Auto-create a new role with**
**default permissions** to automatically set up the required
    permissions, or choose **Use an existing role** to select
    an existing IAM role with the required policies.

Cross-account delivery requires permissions on both sides. The destination delivery
IAM role in the source account requires the following permissions:

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::cross-account-bucket/prefix/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:ResourceAccount": "123456789012"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The Amazon S3 bucket policy in the destination account must grant the source account's
IAM role permission to write objects:

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowScheduledQueryRolePutObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/my-s3-delivery-role"
            },
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::cross-account-bucket/prefix/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Encrypting results with a customer managed AWS KMS key

You can optionally specify a customer managed AWS KMS key to encrypt query results
delivered to Amazon S3 using SSE-KMS. The AWS KMS key can be in the same account as the
scheduled query or in a different account.

When you specify a AWS KMS key, the scheduled query uses that key to encrypt results
via SSE-KMS. When you don't specify a AWS KMS key, the bucket's default encryption
settings apply. If the bucket is configured with default SSE-KMS encryption using a
customer managed key, the destination delivery IAM role must still have
`kms:GenerateDataKey` permission on that key.

The destination delivery IAM role requires `kms:GenerateDataKey`
permission on the AWS KMS key. The following example shows the required permissions
for an Amazon S3 destination with a customer managed AWS KMS key:

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/prefix/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:ResourceAccount": "111122223333"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "kms:GenerateDataKey",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:111122223333:key/key-id",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "kms:ViaService": "s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
                },
                "StringLike": {
                    "kms:EncryptionContext:aws:s3:arn": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket*"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

When the AWS KMS key is in a different account than the destination delivery IAM
role, the AWS KMS key policy in the key-owning account must explicitly grant the
role access:

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowScheduledQueryRoleToEncrypt",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/my-s3-delivery-role"
            },
            "Action": "kms:GenerateDataKey",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "kms:ViaService": "s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
                },
                "StringLike": {
                    "kms:EncryptionContext:aws:s3:arn": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket*"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

###### Note

When the AWS KMS key and the destination delivery IAM role are in the same
account, the IAM identity policy alone is sufficient if the AWS KMS key policy
includes the default "Enable IAM policies" root statement. An explicit AWS KMS key
policy grant is only required if the key policy does not delegate to
IAM.

The IAM role for posting query results to Amazon S3 must be configured separately from
the IAM role for scheduled query execution. This separation allows for fine-grained
access control, where the execution role can run queries while the Amazon S3 role
specifically handles result delivery. Both roles must include a trust policy that allows
the CloudWatch Logs service ( `logs.amazonaws.com`) to assume the role.
