# Logs sent to CloudWatch Logs

###### Important

When you set up the log types in the following list to be sent to CloudWatch Logs, AWS
creates or changes the resource policies associated with the log group receiving
the logs, if needed. Continue reading this section to see the details.

This section applies when the types of logs listed in the table in the preceding
section are sent to CloudWatch Logs:

**User permissions**

To be able to set up sending any of these types of logs to CloudWatch Logs for the first
time, you must be logged into an account with the following permissions.

- `logs:CreateLogDelivery`

- `logs:PutResourcePolicy`

- `logs:DescribeResourcePolicies`

- `logs:DescribeLogGroups`

###### Note

When you specify the `logs:DescribeLogGroups`,
`logs:DescribeResourcePolicies`, or
`logs:PutResourcePolicy` permission, be sure to set the
ARN of its `Resource` line to use a `*` wildcard,
instead of specifying only a single log group name. For example,
`"Resource":
                                  "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:log-group:*"`

If any of these types of logs is already being sent to a log group in CloudWatch Logs, then
to set up the sending of another one of these types of logs to that same log group,
you only need the `logs:CreateLogDelivery` permission.

**Log group resource policy**

The log group where the logs are being sent must have a resource policy that
includes certain permissions. If the log group currently does not have a resource
policy, and the user setting up the logging has the
`logs:PutResourcePolicy`, `logs:DescribeResourcePolicies`,
and `logs:DescribeLogGroups` permissions for the log group, then AWS
automatically creates the following policy for it when you begin sending the logs to
CloudWatch Logs. For newly created
subscriptions, resource policies are configured at the log group level and have
a maximum size of 51,200 bytes. If an existing account-level resource policy
already grants permissions through wildcards, a separate log group level policy
would not be created. To check the logGroup-level resource policy for a specific log
group, use the
`describe-resource-policies` command with the `--resource-arn`
parameter set to the log group ARN and the `--policy-scope` parameter
set to `RESOURCE`.

                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:log-group:my-log-group:log-stream:*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceAccount": [
                        "0123456789"
                    ]
                },
                "ArnLike": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": [
                        "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:*"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

The log group's resource policy limit is 51,200 bytes. Once this limit is reached,
AWS cannot add new permissions. This requires customers to manually modify the
policy to grant the `delivery.logs.amazonaws.com` service principal permissions
on the `logs:CreateLogStream` and `logs:PutLogEvents` actions. Customers
should use a log group name prefix with wildcards such as `/aws/vendedlogs/*`
and use this log group name for future Delivery creation.
