**Log group resource policy**

The log group where the logs are being sent must have a resource policy that
includes certain permissions. If the log group currently does not have a resource
policy, and the user setting up the logging has the
`logs:PutResourcePolicy`, `logs:DescribeResourcePolicies`,
and `logs:DescribeLogGroups` permissions for the log group, then AWS
automatically creates the following policy for it when you begin sending the logs to
CloudWatch Logs. For newly created subscriptions, resource policies are configured at
the log group level and have a maximum size of 51,200 bytes. If an existing
account-level resource policy already grants permissions through wildcards,
a separate log group level policy would not be created. To check the logGroup-level
resource policy for a specific log group, use the
`describe-resource-policies` command with the
`--resource-arn` parameter set to the log group ARN and the
`--policy-scope` parameter set
to `RESOURCE`.

    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AWSLogDeliveryWrite20150319",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": [
                    "delivery.logs.amazonaws.com"
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:log-group:my-log-group:log-stream:*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceAccount": [
                        "0123456789"
                    ]
                },
                "ArnLike": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": [
                        "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:*"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

The log group's resource policy limit is 51,200 bytes. Once this limit is reached,
AWS cannot add new permissions. This requires customers to manually modify the
policy to grant the `delivery.logs.amazonaws.com` service principal permissions
on the `logs:CreateLogStream` and `logs:PutLogEvents` actions. Customers
should use a log group name prefix with wildcards such as `/aws/vendedlogs/*`
and use this log group name for future Delivery creation.
