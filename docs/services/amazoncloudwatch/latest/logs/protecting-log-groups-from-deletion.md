# Protecting log groups from deletion

## Enabling deletion protection

You can enable deletion protection when creating a new log group or on existing log groups. During log group creation, select "Enabled deletion protection" or
by passing the parameter `--deletion-protection-enabled`. By default, deletion protection is not enabled.

###### To enable or disable deletion protection on an existing log group (console)

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Log Management**.

3. Select the log group you want to protect.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Edit deletion protection**.

5. In the dialog box, review and then submit changes.

If using the AWS CLI, to enable deletion protection on an existing log group:

```

aws logs put-log-group-deletion-protection \
--log-group-identifier "/my-application/logs" \
--deletion-protection-enabled
```

To remove deletion protection on an existing log group:

```

aws logs put-log-group-deletion-protection \
--log-group-identifier "/my-application/logs" \
--no-deletion-protection-enabled
```

### Error handling

If you attempt to delete a log group with deletion protection enabled, you receive a `ValidationException` with the message: "Cannot delete log group with deletion protection enabled. Disable deletion protection first."
