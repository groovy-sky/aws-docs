# Step 1: Update the subscription filters

###### Note

This step is needed only for cross-account subscriptions for logs that
are created by the services listed in [Enable logging from AWS services](aws-logs-and-resource-policy.md). If you are not
working with logs created by one of these log groups, you can skip to
[Step 2: Update the existing destination access policy](cross-account-log-subscription-update-policy-account.md).

In certain cases, you must update the subscription filters in all the
sender accounts that are sending logs to the destination account. The update
adds an IAM role, which CloudWatch can assume and validate that the sender
account has permission to send logs to the recipient account.

Follow the steps in this section for every sender account that you want to
update to use organization ID for the cross-account subscription
permissions.

In the examples in this section, two accounts, `111111111111`
and `222222222222` already have subscription filters created to
send logs to account `999999999999`. The existing subscription
filter values are as follows:

```

## Existing Subscription Filter parameter values
{
    "DestinationArn": "arn:aws:logs:region:999999999999:destination:testDestination",
    "FilterPattern": "{$.userIdentity.type = Root}",
    "Distribution": "Random"
}
```

If you need to find the current subscription filter parameter values,
enter the following command.

```nohighlight

aws logs describe-account-policies \
--policy-type "SUBSCRIPTION_FILTER_POLICY" \
--policy-name "CrossAccountStreamsExamplePolicy"
```

###### To update a subscription filter to start using organization IDs for cross-account log permissions

1. Create the following trust policy in a file
    `~/TrustPolicyForCWL.json`. Use a text editor
    to create this policy file; do not use the IAM console.

```

{
     "Statement": {
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": { "Service": "logs.amazonaws.com" },
       "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
     }
}
```

2. Create the IAM role that uses this policy. Take note of the
    `Arn` value of the `Arn` value that is
    returned by the command, you will need it later in this procedure.
    In this example, we use `CWLtoSubscriptionFilterRole` for
    the name of the role we're creating.

```cmd

aws iam create-role
       \ --role-name CWLtoSubscriptionFilterRole
       \ --assume-role-policy-document file://~/TrustPolicyForCWL.json
```

3. Create a permissions policy to define the actions that CloudWatch Logs can
    perform on your account.
1. First, use a text editor to create the following
       permissions policy in a file named
       `/PermissionsForCWLSubscriptionFilter.json`.

      ```

      {
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": "logs:PutLogEvents",
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:region:111111111111:log-group:LogGroupOnWhichSubscriptionFilterIsCreated:*"
              }
          ]
      }
      ```

2. Enter the following command to associate the permissions
       policy you just created with the role that you created in
       step 2.

      ```

      aws iam put-role-policy
          --role-name CWLtoSubscriptionFilterRole
          --policy-name Permissions-Policy-For-CWL-Subscription-filter
          --policy-document file://~/PermissionsForCWLSubscriptionFilter.json
      ```
4. Enter the following command to update the subscription filter
    policy.

```nohighlight

aws logs put-account-policy \
       --policy-name "CrossAccountStreamsExamplePolicy" \
       --policy-type "SUBSCRIPTION_FILTER_POLICY" \
       --policy-document '{"DestinationArn":"arn:aws:logs:region:999999999999:destination:testDestination", "FilterPattern": "{$.userIdentity.type = Root}", "Distribution": "Random"}' \
       --selection-criteria 'LogGroupName NOT IN ["LogGroupToExclude1", "LogGroupToExclude2"]' \
       --scope "ALL"
```
