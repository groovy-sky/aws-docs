# OpenSearch Structured Query Language (SQL)

This section contains a basic introduction to querying CloudWatch Logs using OpenSearch SQL.
It provides a familiar option if you're used to working with relational databases.
OpenSearch SQL offers a subset of SQL functionality, making it a good choice for
performing ad-hoc queries and data analysis tasks. With OpenSearch SQL, you can use
commands such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and various other SQL
commands and functions. You can execute JOINs across log groups, correlate data
across log groups using sub-queries, and use the rich set of JSON, mathematical,
string, conditional, and other SQL functions to perform powerful analysis on log and
security data.

Use `filterIndex` to return indexed data only, by forcing a query to
scan only log groups that are indexed on a field that you specify in the query.
Reduce scanned volume by skipping log groups that do not have any log events
containing the field specified in the query, and only scanning log groups that match
the value specified in the query for this field index. Use `filterIndex`
to specify the field name, along with the field name and value to query only indexed
data containing the field and value specified.

You can use OpenSearch SQL for queries of log groups in the Standard Log Class. SQL
also supports querying using data source name and data source type.

###### Note

The following table lists the SQL commands and functions supported in CloudWatch Logs
For information about all OpenSearch SQL commands including syntax, see [Supported SQL commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/supported-directquery-sql.html) in the OpenSearch Service Developer Guide.

                                            where ds1.field3= "Success"``

Enables you to specify multiple data sources in a SELECT
statement

## Supported SQL for multi-log-group queries

To support the use case for querying multiple log groups in SQL, you can use
the `logGroups` command. Using this syntax, you can query multiple
log groups by specifying them in the FROM command.

Syntax:

```nohighlight

`logGroups(
    logGroupIdentifier: ['LogGroup1','LogGroup2', ...'LogGroupn']
)
```

In this syntax, you can specify up to 50 log groups in the
`logGroupIdentifier` parameter. To reference log groups in a
monitoring account, use ARNs instead of `LogGroup` names.

Example query:

```sql

SELECT LG1.Column1, LG1.Column2 from `logGroups(
    logGroupIdentifier: ['LogGroup1', 'LogGroup2']
)` as LG1 WHERE LG1.Column1 = 'ABC'
```

The following syntax involving multiple log groups after the `FROM`
statement is NOT supported when querying CloudWatch Logs.

```sql

SELECT Column1, Column2 FROM 'LogGroup1', 'LogGroup2', ...'LogGroupn'
WHERE Column1 = 'ABC'
```

## Supported SQL for data source queries

To support the use case for querying data sources in SQL, you can use the
dataSource command. Using this syntax, you can query data sources by specifying
them in the `FROM` command. You can specify up to 10 data sources.

**Syntax**

```

`dataSource(
    ['DataSource1', 'DataSource2', ...'DataSourcen']
)`
```

**Example query**

```

SELECT DS1.Column1, DS1.Column2 from `dataSource(
    ['DataSource1', 'DataSource2']
)` as DS1 WHERE DS1.Column1 = 'ABC'
```

## Query scope

In the AWS CLI and API, you can specify which logs to query by using the log
group, data source and type, and field indexes.

### Log Group

Log Group source selection can be used when customers know which exact log
group(s) need to be searched

```sql

SELECT * FROM `logGroups(logGroupIdentifier: ['/aws/lambda/my-function'])`;
```

### Data Source and Type

Customers can query their logs using data source name and data source
type.

Data source and type based source selection can be used when customers
know which exact data sources need to be queried. This query is executed
over one or more log groups which contain the specified data source and
type.

To support the use case for querying data sources in SQL, you can use the
dataSource command. Using this syntax, you can query data sources by
specifying them in the FROM command. You can specify up to 10 data
sources.

Syntax:

```nohighlight

`dataSource(
    ['DataSource1.Type1', 'DataSource2.Type2', ...'DataSourcen.Typen']
)`
```

Example query:

```sql

SELECT DS1.Column1, DS1.Column2 from `dataSource(
    ['DataSource1.Type1', 'DataSource2.Type2']
)` as DS1 WHERE DS1.Column1 = 'ABC'
```

For more information on querying by data sources, see [Use facets to group and explore logs](cloudwatchlogs-facets.md).

### Combined example

Customers can specify all the source selection operators within the
backticks in any order and the results would be based on the intersection of
the all the conditions applied.

For example, /aws/lambda/my-function-1 might contain multiple data source
& types including wide variety of indexes, when the following query was
ran, the results returned will only have events of source and type
DataSource1.Type1 and matching the criteria of 'status' = 200.

```sql

SELECT * FROM `
   logGroups(logGroupIdentifier: ['/aws/lambda/my-function'])
   filterIndex('status' = 200)
   dataSource(['DataSource1.Type1'])
`;
```

### Field Indexes

Field Index-based source selection automatically identifies relevant log
groups when your filters target indexed fields, reducing scan volume and
query runtime.

Use `filterIndex` to return indexed data only, by forcing a
query to scan only log groups that are indexed on a field that you specify
in the query. For these log groups that are indexed on this field, it
further optimizes the query by skipping the log groups that do not have any
log events containing the field specified in the query for the indexed
field. It further reduces scanned volume by attempting to scan only log
events from these log groups that match the value specified in the query for
this field index. For more information about field indexes and how to create
them, see [Create field indexes\
to improve query performance and reduce scan volume](cloudwatchlogs-field-indexing.md).

In SQL, filterIndex is used to specify which key value pairs should be
treated as indexes. The syntax is as follows

```sql

SELECT * FROM `filterIndex('region' = 'us-east-1')`;
```

where,

1. filterIndex(...) specifies, treat the key values within them as
    field indexes. Each key value pair is separated by a comma (example
    below)

2. 'region' = 'us-east-1' specifies the actual condition to be
    applied

1. Note: Instead of = customers can use IN to specify
    multiple values (example below)

Using multiple filterIndex would combine the conditions using "AND". In
the example, logs matching status=200 and region in us-east-1 or us-west-2
would be queried.

```sql

SELECT * FROM `filterIndex('status' = 200, 'region' IN ['us-east-1', 'us-west-2'])`;
```

## Restrictions

The following restrictions apply when you use OpenSearch SQL to query in
CloudWatch Logs Insights.

- You can include only one JOIN in a SELECT statement.

- You cannot use JOIN or subqueries with data source queries.

- Only one level of nested subqueries is supported.

- Multiple statement queries separated by semi-colons (;) aren't
supported.

- Queries containing field names that are identical but differ only in
case (such as field1 and FIELD1) are not supported.

For example, the following query isn't supported:

```sql

Select AWSAccountId, AwsAccountId from LogGroup
```

However, the following query is supported because the field name
( `@logStream`) is identical in both log groups:

```sql

Select a.`@logStream`, b.`@logStream` from Table A INNER Join Table B on a.id = b.id
```

- Functions and expressions must operate on field names and be part of a
SELECT statement with a log group specified in the FROM clause.

For example, this query is not supported:

```sql

SELECT cos(10) FROM LogGroup
```

This query is supported:

```sql

SELECT cos(field1) FROM LogGroup
```

- When using SQL or PPL commands, enclose certain fields in backticks to
successfully query them. Backticks are necessary for fields with special
characters (non-alphabetic and non-numeric). For example, enclose
`@message`, `Operation.Export`, and
`Test::Field` in backticks. You don't need to enclose
fields with purely alphabetic names in backticks.

Example query with simple fields:

```sql

SELECT SessionToken, Operation, StartTime  FROM `LogGroup-A`
LIMIT 1000;
```

Similar query with backticks appended:

```sql

SELECT `@SessionToken`, `@Operation`, `@StartTime`  FROM `LogGroup-A` LIMIT 1000;
```
