# filterIndex

Use `filterIndex` to return indexed data only, by forcing a
query to scan only log groups that are indexed on a field that you specify
in the query. For these log groups that are indexed on this field, it
further optimizes the query by skipping the log groups that do not have any
log events containing the field specified in the query for the indexed
field. It further reduces scanned volume by attempting to scan only log
events from these log groups that match the value specified in the query for
this field index. For more information about field indexes and how to create
them, see [Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce scan volume](cloudwatchlogs-field-indexing.md).

Using `filterIndex` with indexed fields can help you query log
groups that include petabytes of log data efficiently by limiting the actual
search space to log groups and log events that have field indexes.

For example, suppose that you have created a field index for
`IPaddress` in some of the log groups in your account. You
can then create the following query and choose to query all log groups in
the account to find log events that include the value
`198.51.100.0` in the `IPaddress` field.

```nohighlight

fields @timestamp, @message
| filterIndex IPaddress = "198.51.100.0"
| limit 20
```

The `filterIndex` command causes this query to attempt to skip
all log groups that are not indexed for `IPaddress`.
Additionally, within the log groups that are indexed, the query skips log
events that have an `IPaddress` field but not observed
`198.51.100.0` as the value for that field.

Use the `IN` operator to expand the results to any of multiple
values for the indexed fields. The following example finds logs events that
include either the value `198.51.100.0` or
`198.51.100.1` in the `IPaddress` field.

```nohighlight

fields @timestamp, @message
| filterIndex IPaddress in ["198.51.100.0", "198.51.100.1"]
| limit 20
```

CloudWatch Logs provides default field indexes for all log groups in the Standard log class. Default field
indexes are automatically available for the following fields:

- `@logStream`

- `@aws.region`

- `@aws.account`

- `@source.log`

- `@data_source_name`

- `@data_source_type`

- `@data_format`

- `traceId`

- `severityText`

- `attributes.session.id`

CloudWatch Logs provides default field indexes for certain data source name and type combinations as well. Default field indexes are automatically available for the following data source name and type combinations:

Data Source Name and TypeDefault Field Indexes

`amazon_vpc.flow`

`action`

`logStatus`

`region`

`flowDirection`

`type`

`amazon_route53.resolver_query`

`query_type`

`transport`

`rcode`

`aws_waf.access`

`action`

`httpRequest.country`

`aws_cloudtrail.data`

` aws_cloudtrail.management`

`eventSource`

`eventName`

`awsRegion`

`userAgent`

`errorCode`

`eventType`

`managementEvent`

`readOnly`

`eventCategory`

`requestId`

Default field indexes are in addition to any custom
field indexes you define within your policy. Default field indexes are not counted
towards your [field index quota](cloudwatchlogs-field-indexing-syntax.md).

## filterIndex compared to filter

To illustrate the difference between `filterIndex` and
`filter`, consider the following example queries. Assume
that you have created a field index for `IPaddress`, for four
of your log groups, but not for a fifth log group. The following query
using `filterIndex` will skip scanning the log group that
doesn't have the field indexed. For each indexed log group, it attempts
to scan only log events that have the indexed field, and it also returns
only results from after the field index was created.

```nohighlight

fields @timestamp, @message
| filterIndex IPaddress = "198.51.100.0"
| limit 20
```

In contrast, if you use `filter` instead of
`filterIndex` for a query of the same five log groups,
the query will attempt to scan not only the log events that contain the
value in the indexed log groups, but will also scan the fifth log group
that isn't indexed, and it will scan every log event in that fifth log
group.

```nohighlight

fields @timestamp, @message
| filter IPaddress = "198.51.100.0"
| limit 20
```
