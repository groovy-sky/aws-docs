# Best practices

Follow these best practices to ensure reliable and efficient scheduled query
operations:

**Query optimization**

- Test queries manually before scheduling to verify performance and
results

- Use filter indexes early in your query to reduce data processing

- Limit time ranges to avoid timeouts with high-volume log
groups

- Consider query complexity and execution time limits

**Schedule planning**

- Avoid overlapping executions by ensuring queries complete before
the next scheduled run

- Consider log ingestion delays when setting time ranges

- Use cron expressions for specific times

- Spread out the schedules to ensure you do not hit query concurrency limit

**Monitoring and maintenance**

- Monitor execution history regularly to identify failures or
performance issues

- Review and update IAM roles periodically to maintain
security

- Test destination accessibility before deploying to
production

**Authorization**

- All the APIs for scheduled query authorize on the scheduled query resource and not on the resources it takes in the input like log groups. Set up IAM policies accordingly

- Manage authorization of log groups using the execution role passed in the APIs
