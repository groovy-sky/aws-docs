# Use `DeleteLogGroup` with an AWS SDK or CLI

The following code examples show how to use `DeleteLogGroup`.

Action examples are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. You can see this action in
context in the following code examples:

Examples Repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/dotnetv3/CloudWatchLogs).

```csharp

    using System;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Amazon.CloudWatchLogs;
    using Amazon.CloudWatchLogs.Model;

    /// <summary>
    /// Uses the Amazon CloudWatch Logs Service to delete an existing
    /// CloudWatch Logs log group.
    /// </summary>
    public class DeleteLogGroup
    {
        public static async Task Main()
        {
            var client = new AmazonCloudWatchLogsClient();
            string logGroupName = "cloudwatchlogs-example-loggroup";

            var request = new DeleteLogGroupRequest
            {
                LogGroupName = logGroupName,
            };

            var response = await client.DeleteLogGroupAsync(request);

            if (response.HttpStatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Successfully deleted CloudWatch log group, {logGroupName}.");
            }
        }
