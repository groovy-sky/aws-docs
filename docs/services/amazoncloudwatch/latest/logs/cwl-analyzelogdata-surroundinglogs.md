# Viewing surrounding logs in CloudWatch Logs Insights

You can view log events that occurred before and after a specific log record
returned by your CloudWatch Logs Insights query. Surrounding logs help you understand the context
around errors, warnings, or other significant events.

## How surrounding logs work

When you run a CloudWatch Logs Insights query, each log record in the results includes a
**Surrounding logs** option. When you choose this option,
CloudWatch Logs Insights displays additional log events from the same log stream that occurred
immediately before and after the selected record. These events appear even if
they don't match your original query filters.

You can configure the number of surrounding log lines to display. Choose
from 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100 log lines above and below the selected record.

Surrounding logs are useful in the following scenarios:

- Debugging errors by viewing the events that led to a failure

- Investigating warnings or timeouts in distributed systems

- Understanding the sequence of events across your application

- Analyzing issues in high-volume log environments
