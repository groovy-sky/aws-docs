# Quick Start: Use CloudFormation to get started with CloudWatch Logs

AWS CloudFormation enables you to describe and provision your AWS resources in JSON format. The advantages of
this method include being able to manage a collection of AWS resources as a single unit, and easily
replicating your AWS resources across Regions.

When you provision AWS using CloudFormation, you create templates that describe the AWS
resources to use. The following example is a template snippet that creates
a log group and a metric filter that counts 404 occurrences and sends this count to
the log group.

```json

"WebServerLogGroup": {
    "Type": "AWS::Logs::LogGroup",
    "Properties": {
        "RetentionInDays": 7
    }
},

"404MetricFilter": {
    "Type": "AWS::Logs::MetricFilter",
    "Properties": {
        "LogGroupName": {
            "Ref": "WebServerLogGroup"
        },
        "FilterPattern": "[ip, identity, user_id, timestamp, request, status_code = 404, size, ...]",
        "MetricTransformations": [
            {
                "MetricValue": "1",
                "MetricNamespace": "test/404s",
                "MetricName": "test404Count"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

This is a basic example. You can set up much richer CloudWatch Logs deployments using CloudFormation. For
more information about template examples, see [Amazon CloudWatch Logs Template Snippets](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/quickref-cloudwatchlogs.md)
in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_. For more information about getting
started, see [Getting Started with\
AWS CloudFormation](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/gettingstarted.md) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.
