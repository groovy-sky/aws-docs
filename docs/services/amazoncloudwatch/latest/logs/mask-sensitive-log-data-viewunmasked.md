# View unmasked data

To view unmasked data, a user must have the `logs:Unmask` permission. Users with this permission
can see the unmasked data in the following ways:

- When viewing the events in a log stream, choose **Display**, **Unmask**.

- Use a CloudWatch Logs Insights query that includes the **unmask(@message)** command. The following
example query displays the 20 most recent log events in the stream, unmasked:

```

fields @timestamp, @message, unmask(@message)
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
```

For more information about CloudWatch Logs Insights commands, see
[CloudWatch Logs Insights language query syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax.html).

- Use a [GetLogEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_GetLogEvents.html) or
[FilterLogEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_FilterLogEvents.html) operation with the `unmask` parameter.

The **CloudWatchLogsFullAccess** policy includes the `logs:Unmask` permission. To grant
`logs:Unmask` to a user
who does not have **CloudWatchLogsFullAccess**, you can attach a custom IAM policy to that user.
