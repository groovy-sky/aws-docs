## What are data protection policies?

CloudWatch Logs uses **data protection policies** to select the
sensitive data for which you want to scan, and the actions that you want to take to
protect that data. To select the sensitive
data of interest, you use [data identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL-managed-data-identifiers.html). CloudWatch Logs data protection then detects the sensitive
data by using machine learning and pattern matching. To act upon data identifiers that
are found, you can define **audit** and **de-identify** operations. These operations let you log the sensitive
data that is found (or not found), and to mask the sensitive data when the log events are viewed.

## How is the data protection policy structured?

As illustrated in the following figure, a data protection policy document includes the
following elements:

- Optional policy-wide information at the top of the document

- One statement that defines the audit and de-identify actions

Only one data protection policy can be defined per CloudWatch Logs log group. The data protection
policy can have one or more deny or de-identify statements, but only one audit
statement.

### JSON properties for the data protection policy

A data protection policy requires the following basic policy information for
identification:

- **Name** – The policy name.

- **Description** (Optional) – The
policy description.

- **Version** – The policy language
version. The current version is 2021-06-01.

- **Statement** – A list of statements
that specifies data protection policy actions.

```json

{
  "Name": "CloudWatchLogs-PersonalInformation-Protection",
  "Description": "Protect basic types of sensitive data",
  "Version": "2021-06-01",
  "Statement": [
        ...
  ]
}
```

### JSON properties for a policy statement

A policy statement sets the detection context for the data protection
operation.

- **Sid** (Optional) – The statement
identifier.

- **DataIdentifier** – The sensitive
data for which CloudWatch Logs should scan. For example, name, address, or
phone number.

- **Operation** – The follow-on actions,
either **Audit** or **De-identify**. CloudWatch Logs performs
these actions when it finds sensitive data.

```json

{
  ...
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "audit-policy",
      "DataIdentifier": [
        "arn:aws:dataprotection::aws:data-identifier/Address"
      ],
      "Operation": {
        "Audit": {
          "FindingsDestination": {}
        }
      }
    },
```

### JSON properties for a policy statement operation

A policy statement sets one of the following data protection operations.

- **Audit** – Emits metrics and findings
reports without interrupting logging. Strings that match
increment the **LogEventsWithFindings** metric that CloudWatch Logs publishes to the
**AWS/Logs** namespace in CloudWatch. You can use these metrics to create alarms.

For an example of a findings report,
see [Audit findings reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/mask-sensitive-log-data-audit-findings.html).

For more information
about metrics that CloudWatch Logs sends to CloudWatch, see
[Monitoring with CloudWatch metrics](cloudwatch-logs-monitoring-cloudwatch-metrics.md).

- **De-identify** – Mask the
sensitive data without interrupting logging.
