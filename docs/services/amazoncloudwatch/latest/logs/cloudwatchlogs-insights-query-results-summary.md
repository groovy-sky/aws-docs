# Generate a natural language summary from CloudWatch Logs Insights query results

Analyzing log data is crucial for understanding your applications' behavior, but
interpreting large volumes of log entries can be time-consuming. CloudWatch Logs Insights now offers a
natural language summarization capability that transforms complex query results into
clear, concise summaries. This capability helps you quickly identify issues and gain
actionable insights from your log data.

## How it works

CloudWatch Logs Insights can generate a human-readable summary from your query results using
Amazon Bedrock. The feature supports all CloudWatch Logs Insights query languages and provides clear,
actionable insights from your log data.

## Regional availability and data processing

###### Important

When you use this feature, your query results might be processed in a
different AWS Region. For example, if you run a query in US East (N.
Virginia), the summarization might occur in US West (Oregon).

The following table lists the possible processing AWS Region for the different
geographies in which the query results feature is available:

## Getting started
