# Create an account-wide data protection policy

You can use the CloudWatch Logs console or AWS CLI commands to create a data protection policy to mask sensitive data
for all log groups in your account. Doing so affects both current log groups and log groups that you create
in the future.

###### Important

Sensitive data is detected and masked when it is ingested into the log group. When you set a
data protection policy, log events ingested to the log group before that time are not masked.

- [AWS CLI](#mask-sensitive-log-data-accountlevel-cli)

## Console

###### To use the console to create an account-wide data protection policy

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane,
    choose **Settings**. It is located near the bottom of the list.

3. Choose the **Logs** tab.

4. Choose **Configure**.

5. For **Managed data identifiers**, select the types of data that you want to
    audit and mask
    for all of your log groups. You can type in the selection box to find the identifiers that you want.

We recommend that you select only the data identifiers that are relevant for
    your log data and your business. Choosing many types of data can lead to
    false positives.

For details about which types of data that you can protect, see
    [Types of data that you can protect](protect-sensitive-log-data-types.md).

6. (Optional) If you want to audit and mask other types of data by using custom data identifiers,
    choose **Add custom data identifier**. Then enter a name for the data type and the regular expression
    to use to search for that type of data in the log events. For more information, see
    [Custom data identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL-custom-data-identifiers.html).

A single data protection policy can include up to 10 custom data identifiers. Each regular expression
    that defines a custom data identifier must be 200 characters or fewer.

7. (Optional) Choose one or more services to send the audit findings to. Even if you
    choose not to send audit findings to any of these services, the sensitive data types that you
    select will still be masked.

8. Choose **Activate data protection**.

## AWS CLI

###### To use the AWS CLI to create a data protection policy

1. Use a text editor to create a policy file named `DataProtectionPolicy.json`. For
    information about the policy syntax, see
    the following section.

2. Enter the following command:

```nohighlight

aws logs put-account-policy \
   --policy-name TEST_POLICY --policy-type "DATA_PROTECTION_POLICY" \
   --policy-document file://policy.json \
   --scope "ALL" \
   --region us-west-2
```

### Data protection policy syntax for AWS CLI or API operations

When you create a JSON data protection policy to use in an AWS CLI command
or API operation, the policy must include two JSON blocks:

- The first block must include both a `DataIdentifer` array and an
`Operation` property with an `Audit` action. The `DataIdentifer` array lists the types of sensitive data that
you want to mask. For more information about the available options, see
[Types of data that you can protect](protect-sensitive-log-data-types.md).

The `Operation` property with an `Audit`
action is required to find the sensitive data terms. This
`Audit` action must contain a
`FindingsDestination` object. You can optionally use
that `FindingsDestination` object to list one or more
destinations to send audit findings reports to. If you specify destinations
such as log groups, Amazon Data Firehose streams, and S3 buckets, they must
already exist. For an example of an audit findins report,
see [Audit findings reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/mask-sensitive-log-data-audit-findings.html).

- The second block must include both a `DataIdentifer` array and an
`Operation` property with an `Deidentify`
action. The `DataIdentifer` array must exactly match the
`DataIdentifer` array in the first block of the
policy.

The `Operation` property with the `Deidentify` action is what actually masks the
data, and it must
contain the `
                                          "MaskConfig": {}` object. The `
                                              "MaskConfig": {}` object must be empty.

The following is an example of a data protection policy using only managed data identifiers.
This policy masks email
addresses and United States driver's licenses.

For information about policies that specify custom data identifiers, see
[Using custom data identifiers in your data protection policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL-custom-data-identifiers.html#using-custom-data-identifiers).
