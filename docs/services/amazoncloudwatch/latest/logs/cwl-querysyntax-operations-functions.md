## Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators accept numeric data types as arguments and
return numeric results. Use arithmetic operators in the
`filter` and `fields` commands and as
arguments for other functions.

OperationDescription

`a + b`

Addition

`a - b`

Subtraction

`a * b`

Multiplication

`a / b`

Division

`a ^ b`

Exponentiation ( `2 ^ 3` returns
`8`)

`a % b`

Remainder or modulus ( `10 % 3` returns
`1`)

## Boolean operators

Use the Boolean operators `and`,
`or`, and
`not`.

###### Note

Use Boolean operators only in functions that return a value of
**TRUE** or **FALSE**.

## Comparison operators

Comparison operators accept all data types as arguments and return a
Boolean result. Use comparison operations in the `filter`
command and as arguments for other functions.

OperatorDescription

`=`

Equal

`!=`

Not equal

`<`

Less than

`>`

Greater than

`<=`

Less than or equal to

`>=`

Greater than or equal to

## Numeric operators

Numeric operations accept numeric data types as arguments and return
numeric results. Use numeric operations in the `filter` and
`fields` commands and as arguments for other functions.

OperationResult typeDescription

`abs(a: number)`

number

Absolute value

`ceil(a: number)`

number

Round to ceiling (the smallest integer that is
greater than the value of `a`)

`floor(a: number)`

number

Round to floor (the largest integer that is
smaller than the value of `a`)

`greatest(a: number, ...numbers:
                                                  number[])`

number

Returns the largest value

`least(a: number, ...numbers: number[])`

number

Returns the smallest value

`log(a: number)`

number

Natural log

`sqrt(a: number)`

number

Square root

## Structure types

A map or list is a structure type in CloudWatch Logs Insights that allows you to
access and use attributes for queries.

###### Example: To get a map or list

Use `jsonParse` to parse a field that's a json string
into a map or a list.

```nohighlight

fields jsonParse(@message) as json_message
```

###### Example: To access attributes

Use the dot access operator (map.attribute) to access items in a
map.. If an attribute in a map contains special characters, use
backticks to enclose the attribute name
(map.attributes.\`special.char\`).

```nohighlight

fields jsonParse(@message) as json_message
| stats count() by json_message.status_code
```

Use the bracket access operator (list\[index\]) to retrieve an item at
a specific position within the list.

```nohighlight

fields jsonParse(@message) as json_message
| filter json_message.users[1].action = "PutData"
```

Wrap special characters in backticks (\`\`) when special characters are
present in the key name.

```nohighlight

fields jsonParse(@message) as json_message
| filter json_message.`user.id` = "123"
```

###### Example: empty results

Maps and lists are treated as null for string, number, and
datetime functions.

```nohighlight

fields jsonParse(@message) as json_message
| display toupper(json_message)
```

Comparing map and list to any other fields result in
`false`.

###### Note

Using map and list in `dedup`, `pattern`,
`sort`, and `stats` isn't supported.

## Datetime functions

**Datetime functions**

Use datetime functions in the `fields` and
`filter` commands and as arguments for other functions.
Use these functions to create time buckets for queries with aggregate
functions. Use time periods that consist of a number and one of the
following:

- `ms` for milliseconds

- `s` for seconds

- `m` for minutes

- `h` for hours

For example, `10m` is 10 minutes, and `1h` is 1
hour.

###### Note

Use the most appropriate time unit for your datetime function.
CloudWatch Logs caps your request according to the time unit that you choose.
For example, it caps 60 as the maximum value for any request that
uses `s`. So, if you specify `bin(300s)`,
CloudWatch Logs actually implements this as 60 seconds, because 60 is the
number of seconds in a minute so CloudWatch Logs won't use a number higher
than 60 with `s`. To create a 5-minute bucket, use
`bin(5m)` instead.

The cap for `ms` is 1000, the caps for `s`
and `m` are 60, and the cap for `h` is
24.

The following table contains a list of the different datetime
functions that you can use in query commands. The table lists each
function's result type and contains a description of each function.

###### Tip

When you create a query command, you can use the time interval
selector to select a time period that you want to query. For
example, you can set a time period between 5 and 30-minute
intervals; 1, 3, and 12-hour intervals; or a custom time frame. You
also can set time periods between specific dates.

FunctionResult typeDescription

`bin(period: Period)`

Timestamp

Rounds the value of `@timestamp` to the
given time period and then truncates. For example,
`bin(5m)` rounds the value of
`@timestamp` to the nearest 5
minutes.

You can use this to group multiple log entries
together in a query. The following example returns
the count of exceptions per hour:

```

filter @message like /Exception/
    | stats count(*) as exceptionCount by bin(1h)
    | sort exceptionCount desc
```

The following time units and abbreviations are
supported with the `bin` function. For
all units and abbreviations that include more than
one character, adding s to pluralize is supported.
So both `hr` and `hrs` work to
specify hours.

- `millisecond` `ms` `msec`

- `second` `s` `sec`

- `minute` `m` `min`

- `hour` `h` `hr`

- `day` `d`

- `week` `w`

- `month` `mo` `mon`

- `quarter` `q` `qtr`

- `year` `y` `yr`

`datefloor(timestamp: Timestamp, period:
                                                  Period)`

Timestamp

Truncates the timestamp to the given period. For
example, `datefloor(@timestamp, 1h)`
truncates all values of `@timestamp` to
the bottom of the hour.

`dateceil(timestamp: Timestamp, period:
                                                  Period)`

Timestamp

Rounds up the timestamp to the given period and
then truncates. For example,
`dateceil(@timestamp, 1h)` truncates
all values of `@timestamp` to the top of
the hour.

`fromMillis(fieldName:
                                            number)`

Timestamp

Interprets the input field as the number of
milliseconds since the Unix epoch and converts it to
a timestamp.

`toMillis(fieldName:
                                            Timestamp)`

number

Converts the timestamp found in the named field
into a number representing the milliseconds since
the Unix epoch. For example,
`toMillis(@timestamp)` converts the
timestamp
`2022-01-14T13:18:031.000-08:00` to
`1642195111000`.

`now()`

number

Returns the time that the query processing was
started, in epoch seconds. This function takes no
arguments.

You can use this to filter your query results
according to the current time.

For example, the following query returns all 4xx
errors from the past two hours:

```nohighlight

parse @message "Status Code: *;" as statusCode\n
| filter statusCode >= 400 and statusCode <= 499  \n
| filter toMillis(@timestamp) >= (now() * 1000 - 7200000)
```

The following example returns all log entries from
the past five hours that contain either the word
`error` or `failure`

```nohighlight

fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /(?i)(error|failure)/
| filter toMillis(@timestamp) >= (now() * 1000 - 18000000)
```

###### Note

Currently, CloudWatch Logs Insights doesn't support filtering logs with human
readable timestamps.

## General functions

block.

## String functions

**String functions**

Use string functions in the `fields` and
`filter` commands and as arguments for other functions.

FunctionResult typeDescription

`isempty(fieldName:
                                            string)`

Number

Returns `1` if the field is missing or
is an empty string.

`isblank(fieldName:
                                            string)`

Number

Returns `1` if the field is missing, an
empty string, or contains only white space.

`concat(str: string, ...strings:
                                                  string[])`

string

Concatenates the strings.

`ltrim(str: string)`

`ltrim(str: string, trimChars:
                                                string)`

string

If the function does not have a second argument,
it removes white space from the left of the string.
If the function has a second string argument, it
does not remove white space. Instead, it removes the
characters in `trimChars` from the left
of `str`. For example,
`ltrim("xyZxyfooxyZ","xyZ")` returns
`"fooxyZ"`.

`rtrim(str: string)`

`rtrim(str: string, trimChars:
                                                string)`

string

If the function does not have a second argument,
it removes white space from the right of the string.
If the function has a second string argument, it
does not remove white space. Instead, it removes the
characters of `trimChars` from the right
of `str`. For example,
`rtrim("xyZfooxyxyZ","xyZ")` returns
`"xyZfoo"`.

`trim(str: string)`

`trim(str: string, trimChars:
                                                string)`

string

If the function does not have a second argument,
it removes white space from both ends of the string.
If the function has a second string argument, it
does not remove white space. Instead, it removes the
characters of `trimChars` from both sides
of `str`. For example,
`trim("xyZxyfooxyxyZ","xyZ")` returns
`"foo"`.

`strlen(str: string)`

number

Returns the length of the string in Unicode code
points.

`toupper(str: string)`

string

Converts the string to uppercase.

`tolower(str: string)`

string

Converts the string to lowercase.

`substr(str: string, startIndex:
                                                  number)`

`substr(str: string, startIndex: number,
                                                  length: number)`

string

Returns a substring from the index specified by
the number argument to the end of the string. If the
function has a second number argument, it contains
the length of the substring to be retrieved. For
example, `substr("xyZfooxyZ",3, 3)`
returns `"foo"`.

`replace(fieldName: string, searchValue:
                                                  string, replaceValue:
                                            string)`

string

Replaces all instances of `searchValue`
in `fieldName: string` with
`replaceValue`.

For example, the function
`replace(logGroup,"smoke_test","Smoke")`
searches for log events where the field
`logGroup` contains the string value
`smoke_test` and replaces the value
with the string `Smoke`.

`strcontains(str: string, searchValue:
                                                  string)`

number

Returns 1 if `str` contains
`searchValue` and 0 otherwise.
