# Quick Start: Enable your Amazon EC2 instances running Windows Server 2016 to send logs to CloudWatch Logs using the CloudWatch Logs agent

###### Tip

CloudWatch includes a new unified agent that can collect both logs and metrics from EC2 instances and on-premises servers. We recommend
that you use the newer unified CloudWatch
agent. For more information,
see [Getting started with CloudWatch Logs](cwl-gettingstarted.md).

The rest of this section explains the use of the older CloudWatch Logs agent.

## Enable your Amazon EC2 instances running Windows Server 2016 to send logs to CloudWatch Logs using the older CloudWatch Logs agent

There are multiple methods you can use to enable instances running Windows Server 2016 to send
logs to CloudWatch Logs. The steps in this section use Systems Manager Run Command. For information about the other possible methods, see
[Sending Logs, Events, and Performance Counters to Amazon CloudWatch](../../../ec2/latest/windowsguide/send-logs-to-cwl.md).

###### Steps

- [Download the sample configuration file](#configure_cwl_download)

- [Configure the JSON file for CloudWatch](#send_logs_to_cwl_json)

- [Create an IAM role for Systems Manager](#iam_permissions)

- [Verify Systems Manager prerequisites](#send_logs_cwl_syspre)

- [Verify internet access](#send_logs_cwl_internet)

- [Enable CloudWatch Logs using Systems Manager Run Command](#remote-commands-cloudwatch)

### Download the sample configuration file

Download the following sample file to your computer: [`AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch.json`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/CloudWatchConfig/AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch.json).

### Configure the JSON file for CloudWatch

You determine which logs to send to CloudWatch by
specifying your choices in a configuration file. The process of creating this file
and specifying your choices can take 30 minutes or more to complete. After you have
completed this task once, you can reuse the configuration file on all of your
instances.

###### Steps

- [Step 1: Enable CloudWatch Logs](#enable-CloudWatchLogs-in-JSON-file)

- [Step 2: Configure settings for CloudWatch](#configure_cwl_credentials)

- [Step 3: Configure the data to send](#configure_logs)

- [Step 4: Configure flow control](#configure_log_flow)

- [Step 5: Save JSON content](#save_json_content)

#### Step 1: Enable CloudWatch Logs

At the top of the JSON file, change "false" to "true" for `IsEnabled`:

```

"IsEnabled": true,
```

#### Step 2: Configure settings for CloudWatch

Specify credentials, Region, a log group name, and a log stream namespace.
This enables the instance to send log data to CloudWatch Logs. To send the same log
data to different locations, you can add additional sections with unique IDs
(for example, "CloudWatchLogs2" and CloudWatchLogs3") and a different Region
for each ID.

###### To configure settings to send log data to CloudWatch Logs

1. In the JSON file, locate the `CloudWatchLogs` section.

```json

{
       "Id": "CloudWatchLogs",
       "FullName": "AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch.CloudWatchLogsOutput,AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch",
       "Parameters": {
           "AccessKey": "",
           "SecretKey": "",
           "Region": "us-east-1",
           "LogGroup": "Default-Log-Group",
           "LogStream": "{instance_id}"
       }
},
```

2. Leave the `AccessKey` and `SecretKey` field
    blank. You configure credentials using an IAM role.

3. For `Region`, type the Region to which to send log data
    (for example, `us-east-2`).

4. For `LogGroup`, type the name for your log group. This name
    appears on the **Log Groups** screen in the CloudWatch
    console.

5. For `LogStream`, type the destination log stream. This name
    appears on the **Log Groups > Streams** screen
    in the CloudWatch console.

If you use `{instance_id}`, the default, the log stream
    name is the instance ID of this instance.

If you specify a log stream name that doesn't already exist, CloudWatch Logs
    automatically creates it for you. You can define a log stream name
    using a literal string, the predefined variables `{instance_id}`,
    `{hostname}`, and `{ip_address}`, or a
    combination of these.

#### Step 3: Configure the data to send

You can send event log data, Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) data,
and other log data to CloudWatch Logs.

###### To send Windows application event log data to CloudWatch Logs

1. In the JSON file, locate the `ApplicationEventLog`
    section.

```json

{
       "Id": "ApplicationEventLog",
       "FullName": "AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch.EventLog.EventLogInputComponent,AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch",
       "Parameters": {
           "LogName": "Application",
           "Levels": "1"
       }
},
```

2. For `Levels`, specify the type of messages to upload.
    You can specify one of the following values:

- `1` \- Upload only error messages.

- `2` \- Upload only warning messages.

- `4` \- Upload only information messages.

You can combine values to include more than one type of message.
For example, a value of `3` uploads error messages
( `1`) and warning messages ( `2`).
A value of `7` uploads error messages
( `1`), warning messages ( `2`),
and information messages ( `4`).

###### To send security log data to CloudWatch Logs

1. In the JSON file, locate the `SecurityEventLog`
    section.

```json

{
       "Id": "SecurityEventLog",
       "FullName": "AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch.EventLog.EventLogInputComponent,AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch",
       "Parameters": {
           "LogName": "Security",
           "Levels": "7"
       }
},
```

2. For `Levels`, type `7` to upload all messages.

###### To send system event log data to CloudWatch Logs

1. In the JSON file, locate the `SystemEventLog`
    section.

```json

{
       "Id": "SystemEventLog",
       "FullName": "AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch.EventLog.EventLogInputComponent,AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch",
       "Parameters": {
           "LogName": "System",
           "Levels": "7"
       }
},
```

2. For `Levels`, specify the type of messages to upload.
    You can specify one of the following values:

- `1` \- Upload only error messages.

- `2` \- Upload only warning messages.

- `4` \- Upload only information messages.

You can combine values to include more than one type of message.
For example, a value of `3` uploads error messages
( `1`) and warning messages ( `2`).
A value of `7` uploads error messages
( `1`), warning messages ( `2`),
and information messages ( `4`).

###### To send other types of event log data to CloudWatch Logs

1. In the JSON file, add a new section. Each section must have a
    unique `Id`.

```json

{
       "Id": "Id-name",
       "FullName": "AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch.EventLog.EventLogInputComponent,AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch",
       "Parameters": {
           "LogName": "Log-name",
           "Levels": "7"
       }
},
```

2. For `Id`, type a name for the log
    to upload (for example, `WindowsBackup`).

3. For `LogName`, type the name of the
    log to upload. You can find the name of the log as follows.
1. Open Event Viewer.

2. In the navigation pane, choose
       **Applications and Services Logs**.

3. Navigate to the log, and then
       choose **Actions**, **Properties**.
4. For `Levels`, specify the type of messages to upload.
    You can specify one of the following values:

- `1` \- Upload only error messages.

- `2` \- Upload only warning messages.

You can combine values to include more than one type of message.
For example, a value of `3` uploads error messages
( `1`) and warning messages ( `2`).
A value of `7` uploads error messages
( `1`), warning messages ( `2`),
and information messages ( `4`).

###### To send Event Tracing for Windows data to CloudWatch Logs

ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) provides an efficient and detailed logging
mechanism that applications can write logs to. Each ETW is controlled by a
session manager that can start and stop the logging session. Each session
has a provider and one or more consumers.

1. In the JSON file, locate the `ETW` section.

```json

{
       "Id": "ETW",
       "FullName": "AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch.EventLog.EventLogInputComponent,AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch",
       "Parameters": {
           "LogName": "Microsoft-Windows-WinINet/Analytic",
           "Levels": "7"
       }
},
```

2. For `LogName`, type the name of the log to upload.

3. For `Levels`, specify the type of messages to upload.
    You can specify one of the following values:

- `1` \- Upload only error messages.

- `2` \- Upload only warning messages.

- `4` \- Upload only information messages.

You can combine values to include more than one type of message.
For example, a value of `3` uploads error messages
( `1`) and warning messages ( `2`).
A value of `7` uploads error messages
( `1`), warning messages ( `2`),
and information messages ( `4`).

###### To send custom logs (any text-based log file) to CloudWatch Logs

1. In the JSON file, locate the `CustomLogs`
    section.

```json

{
       "Id": "CustomLogs",
       "FullName": "AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch.CustomLog.CustomLogInputComponent,AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch",
       "Parameters": {
           "LogDirectoryPath": "C:\\CustomLogs\\",
           "TimestampFormat": "MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss",
           "Encoding": "UTF-8",
           "Filter": "",
           "CultureName": "en-US",
           "TimeZoneKind": "Local",
           "LineCount": "5"
       }
},
```

2. For `LogDirectoryPath`, type the path
    where logs are stored on your instance.

3. For `TimestampFormat`, type the time stamp format to use.
    For more information about supported values, see the [Custom Date and Time Format Strings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8kb3ddd4(v=vs.110).aspx) topic on
    MSDN.

###### Important

Your source log file must have the time stamp at the beginning of
each log line and there must be a space following the time
stamp.

4. For `Encoding`, type the file
    encoding to use (for example, UTF-8). For a list of supported values, see the
    [Encoding Class](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.encoding.aspx) topic on MSDN.

###### Note

Use the encoding name, not the display name.

5. (Optional) For `Filter`, type the prefix of log names.
    Leave this parameter blank to monitor all files. For more
    information about supported values, see the [FileSystemWatcherFilter Property](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.filesystemwatcher.filter.aspx) topic on MSDN.

6. (Optional) For `CultureName`, type the locale where the
    time stamp is logged. If `CultureName` is blank, it
    defaults to the same locale currently used by your Windows instance.
    For more information about, see the `Language tag` column
    in the table in the [Product Behavior](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc233982.aspx) topic on MSDN.

###### Note

The `div`, `div-MV`,
`hu`, and `hu-HU` values
are not supported.

7. (Optional) For `TimeZoneKind`, type `Local` or
    `UTC`. You can set this to provide time zone
    information when no time zone information is included in your log's
    time stamp. If this parameter is left blank and if your time stamp
    doesn't include time zone information, CloudWatch Logs defaults to the local
    time zone. This parameter is ignored if your time stamp already
    contains time zone information.

8. (Optional) For `LineCount`, type the
    number of lines in the header to identify the log file. For example, IIS
    log files have virtually identical headers. You could enter
    `5`, which would read the first three lines of
    the log file header to identify it. In IIS log files, the third
    line is the date and time stamp, but the time stamp is not always
    guaranteed to be different between log files. For this reason, we
    recommend including at least one line of actual log data to uniquely
    fingerprint the log file.

###### To send IIS log data to CloudWatch Logs

1. In the JSON file, locate the `IISLog`
    section.

```json

{
       "Id": "IISLogs",
       "FullName": "AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch.CustomLog.CustomLogInputComponent,AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch",
       "Parameters": {
           "LogDirectoryPath": "C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1",
           "TimestampFormat": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss",
           "Encoding": "UTF-8",
           "Filter": "",
           "CultureName": "en-US",
           "TimeZoneKind": "UTC",
           "LineCount": "5"
       }
},
```

2. For `LogDirectoryPath`, type the
    folder where IIS logs are stored for an individual site (for example,
    `C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVCn`).

###### Note

Only W3C log format is supported. IIS, NCSA, and Custom formats
are not supported.

3. For `TimestampFormat`, type the time stamp format to use.
    For more information about supported values, see the [Custom Date and Time Format Strings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8kb3ddd4(v=vs.110).aspx) topic on
    MSDN.

4. For `Encoding`, type the file encoding to use (for example,
    UTF-8). For more information about supported values, see the [Encoding Class](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.encoding.aspx) topic on MSDN.

###### Note

Use the encoding name, not the display name.

5. (Optional) For `Filter`, type the prefix of log names.
    Leave this parameter blank to monitor all files. For more
    information about supported values, see the [FileSystemWatcherFilter Property](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.filesystemwatcher.filter.aspx) topic on MSDN.

6. (Optional) For `CultureName`, type the locale where the
    time stamp is logged. If `CultureName` is blank, it
    defaults to the same locale currently used by your Windows instance.
    For more information about supported values, see the `Language
                                       tag` column in the table in the [Product Behavior](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc233982.aspx) topic on MSDN.

###### Note

The `div`, `div-MV`,
`hu`, and `hu-HU` values
are not supported.

7. (Optional) For `TimeZoneKind`, enter `Local` or
    `UTC`. You can set this to provide time zone
    information when no time zone information is included in your log's
    time stamp. If this parameter is left blank and if your time stamp
    doesn't include time zone information, CloudWatch Logs defaults to the local
    time zone. This parameter is ignored if your time stamp already
    contains time zone information.

8. (Optional) For `LineCount`, type the
    number of lines in the header to identify the log file. For example, IIS
    log files have virtually identical headers. You could enter
    `5`, which would read the first five lines of the
    log file's header to identify it. In IIS log files, the third line
    is the date and time stamp, but the time stamp is not always guaranteed
    to be different between log files. For this reason, we recommend
    including at least one line of actual log data for uniquely
    fingerprinting the log file.

#### Step 4: Configure flow control

Each data type must have a corresponding destination in the `Flows` section.
For example, to send the custom log, ETW log, and system log to CloudWatch Logs, add
`(CustomLogs,ETW,SystemEventLog),CloudWatchLogs` to the `Flows` section.

###### Warning

Adding a step that is not valid blocks the flow. For example,
if you add a disk metric step, but your instance doesn't have a
disk, all steps in the flow are blocked.

You can send the same log file to more than one destination. For example, to
send the application log to two different destinations that you defined in
the `CloudWatchLogs` section, add
`ApplicationEventLog,(CloudWatchLogs,CloudWatchLogs2)` to the
`Flows` section.

###### To configure flow control

1. In the `AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch.json` file, locate
    the `Flows` section.

```json

"Flows": {
       "Flows": [
         "PerformanceCounter,CloudWatch",
         "(PerformanceCounter,PerformanceCounter2), CloudWatch2",
         "(CustomLogs, ETW, SystemEventLog),CloudWatchLogs",
         "CustomLogs, CloudWatchLogs2",
         "ApplicationEventLog,(CloudWatchLogs, CloudWatchLogs2)"
       ]
}
```

2. For `Flows`, add each data type that is to be uploaded
    (for example, `ApplicationEventLog`) and its
    destination (for example, `CloudWatchLogs`).

#### Step 5: Save JSON content

You are now finished editing the JSON file. Save it, and paste the file contents
into a text editor in another window. You will need the file contents in a later step of this procedure.

### Create an IAM role for Systems Manager

An IAM role for instance credentials is required when you use Systems Manager Run Command. This
role enables Systems Manager to perform actions on the instance. For more
information, see [Configuring \
Security Roles for Systems Manager](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-access.md) in the _AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.
For information about how to attach an IAM role to an existing instance, see [Attaching an IAM Role to an Instance](../../../ec2/latest/windowsguide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.md#attach-iam-role) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

### Verify Systems Manager prerequisites

Before you use Systems Manager Run Command to configure
integration with CloudWatch Logs, verify that your instances meet the minimum
requirements. For more information, see [Systems Manager Prerequisites](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up.md) in the _AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

### Verify internet access

Your Amazon EC2 Windows Server instances and managed instances must have outbound
internet access in order to send log and event data to CloudWatch. For more information
about how to configure internet access, see [Internet Gateways](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-internet-gateway.md) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.

### Enable CloudWatch Logs using Systems Manager Run Command

Run Command enables you to manage the configuration of your instances on demand.
You specify a Systems Manager document, specify parameters, and execute the command on one
or more instances. The SSM agent on the instance processes the command and
configures the instance as specified.

###### To configure integration with CloudWatch Logs using Run Command

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. Open the SSM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager).

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Run Command**.

4. Choose **Run a command**.

5. For **Command document**, choose
    **AWS-ConfigureCloudWatch**.

6. For **Target instances**, choose the instances to integrate
    with CloudWatch Logs. If you do not see an instance in this list, it might not be configured
    for Run Command. For more information, see [Systems Manager Prerequisites](../../../ec2/latest/windowsguide/systems-manager-setting-up.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

7. For **Status**, choose **Enabled**.

8. For **Properties**, copy and paste the JSON content you created in the previous tasks.

9. Complete the remaining optional fields and choose **Run**.

Use the following procedure to view the results of command execution in the
Amazon EC2 console.

###### To view command output in the console

1. Select a command.

2. Choose the **Output** tab.

3. Choose **View Output**. The command output page shows
    the results of your command execution.
