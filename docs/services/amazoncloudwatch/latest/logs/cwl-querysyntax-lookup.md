# lookup

Use `lookup` to enrich your query results with reference data
from a lookup table. A lookup table contains CSV data that you upload to
Amazon CloudWatch Logs. When a query runs, the `lookup` command matches a
field in your log events against a field in the lookup table and appends the
specified output fields to the results.

Use lookup tables for data enrichment scenarios such as mapping user IDs
to user details, product codes to product information, or error codes to
error descriptions.

## Creating and managing lookup tables

Before you can use the `lookup` command in a query, you
must create a lookup table. You can create and manage lookup tables
from the CloudWatch console or by using the Amazon CloudWatch Logs API.

###### To create a lookup table (console)

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Settings**,
    and then choose the **Logs** tab.

3. Scroll to **Lookup tables** and choose
    **Manage**.

4. Choose **Create lookup table**.

5. Enter a name for the lookup table. The name can contain only
    alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.

6. (Optional) Enter a description.

7. Upload a CSV file. The file must include a header row with
    column names, use UTF-8 encoding, and not exceed 10 MB.

8. (Optional) Specify a AWS KMS key to encrypt the table
    data.

9. Choose **Create**.

After you create a lookup table, you can view it in the CloudWatch Logs Insights
query editor. Choose the **Lookup tables** tab to
browse available tables and their fields.

To update a lookup table, select the table and choose
**Actions**, **Update**. Upload a
new CSV file to replace all existing content. To delete a lookup table,
choose **Actions**,
**Delete**.

###### Note

You can create up to 100 lookup tables per account per
AWS Region. CSV files can be up to 10 MB. You can also manage
lookup tables by using the Amazon CloudWatch Logs API. For more information, see
[CreateLookupTable](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatchlogs/latest/apireference/api-createlookuptable.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch Logs API_
_Reference_.

###### Note

If the lookup table is encrypted with a KMS key, the caller must have the
`kms:Decrypt` permission on the key (the KMS key used to encrypt the lookup table) to use the `StartQuery` API
with a query that references that lookup table. For more information, see
[Encrypt lookup tables in CloudWatch Logs using AWS Key Management Service](encrypt-lookup-tables-kms.md).

## Query syntax for lookup

###### Command structure

The following shows the format of this command.

```nohighlight

lookup table match-fields output-mode output-field[,...]
```

The command uses the following arguments:

- `table` – The
name of the lookup table to use.

- `match-fields` –
Specify one or more fields to match log events against the
lookup table. You can use either of the following
forms:

- `lookup-field as
                                              log-field
                                              [,...]` – Use `as` when the
lookup table column name differs from the log event
field name. For example,
`ip_address as srcAddr` matches the
`ip_address` column in the lookup table
against the `srcAddr` field in your log
events.

- `lookup-field
                                              [,...]` – When the log event field name
is the same as the lookup table column name, you can
omit `as` and specify the field name
directly. For example, `department, role`
matches both columns against log event fields with
the same names.

When multiple match fields are specified, a row in the
lookup table must match all fields to produce a result (AND
logic).

- `output-mode` –
Specifies how output fields are added to the results. Use one
of the following:

- `OUTPUT` – Adds the output fields
to the results. If a field with the same name already
exists in the log event, it is overwritten with the
lookup table value. If no match is found, the field is
set to null.

- `OUTPUTNEW` – Adds the output
fields to the results only if the field does not
already exist in the log event. If the field already
has a value, the original value is kept. If no match
is found, the field is left unchanged.

- `output-field` –
One or more fields from the lookup table to add to the
results.

###### Example: Enrich log events with user details

Suppose you have a log group with events that contain an
`id` field, and a lookup table named
`user_data` with columns `id`,
`name`, `email`, and
`department`. The following query enriches each log
event with the user's name, email, and department from the lookup
table.

```nohighlight

fields action, status, name, email, department
| lookup user_data id OUTPUT name, email, department
```

###### Example: Use lookup with aggregation

You can use lookup output fields with aggregation functions. The
following query enriches log events with user details and then
counts events grouped by email address.

```nohighlight

fields user_id, action, username, email, department
| lookup user_data user_id OUTPUT username, email, department
| stats count(*) by email
```

###### Example: Use lookup with filter

You can filter results based on fields returned by the lookup.
The following query enriches log events and then filters to show
only events from a specific department.

```nohighlight

fields user_id, action
| lookup user_data user_id OUTPUT username, email, department
| filter department = "Engineering"
```

###### Example: Use OUTPUTNEW to enrich without overwriting

If your log events already contain a `hostname`
field but it's sometimes empty, use `OUTPUTNEW` to
fill in missing values without overwriting existing ones.

```nohighlight

fields srcAddr, hostname
| lookup known_hosts ip_address as srcAddr OUTPUTNEW hostname, region
```

###### Example: Use lookup with multiple match fields

You can match on more than one field. The following query
matches both `srcAddr` and `dstPort`
against the lookup table to identify known network
services.

```nohighlight

fields @timestamp, srcAddr, dstAddr, dstPort
| lookup network_services ip_address as srcAddr, port as dstPort OUTPUT service_name, owner
| filter ispresent(service_name)
```

###### Example: Use lookup with matching field names

When your log event field names match the lookup table column
names exactly, you can omit the `as` keyword. The
following query matches both `department` and
`role` fields directly against the lookup
table.

```nohighlight

fields @timestamp, department, role
| lookup employees department, role OUTPUT office, manager
```
