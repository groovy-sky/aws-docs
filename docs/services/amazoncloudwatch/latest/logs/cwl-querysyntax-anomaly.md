# anomaly

Use `anomaly` to automatically identify unusual patterns and
potential issues within your log data using machine learning.

The `anomaly` command extends the existing `pattern`
functionality and leverages advanced analytics to help identify potential
anomalies in log data. You can use `anomaly` to reduce the time
it takes to identify and resolve operational issues by automatically
surfacing unusual patterns or behaviors in your logs.

The `anomaly` command works with the `
                            pattern` command to
first identify log patterns, then detect anomalies within those patterns.
You can also combine `anomaly` with the `
                            filter` or `
                            sort` commands to
focus anomaly detection on specific subsets of your data.

**Anomaly Command Input**

The `anomaly` command is typically used after the `
                            pattern` command to
analyze the patterns identified in your log data. The command does not
require additional parameters and analyzes the output from preceding
commands in your query.

**Types of Anomalies Identified**

The `anomaly` command identifies five distinct types of
anomalies:

- _Pattern Frequency Anomalies_: Unusual
frequencies of specific log patterns, such as when an application
starts generating more error messages than usual.

- _New Pattern Anomalies_: Previously unseen log
patterns that may indicate new types of errors or messages appearing
in your logs.

- _Token Variation Anomalies_: Unexpected changes
in log message contents that may indicate unusual variations in
expected log formats.

- _Numerical Token Anomalies_: Unusual changes in
numerical values within logs that can help detect potential
performance issues or unexpected metric variations.

- _HTTP Error Code Anomalies_: Patterns related
to HTTP error responses, particularly useful when monitoring web
applications and APIs.

**Anomaly Command Output**

The `anomaly` command preserves all fields from the input data
and adds anomaly detection results to help identify unusual patterns in your
log data.

**Examples**

The following command identifies patterns in your log data and then
detects anomalies within those patterns:

```

fields @timestamp, @message
| pattern @message
| anomaly
```

The `anomaly` command can be used with filtering to focus on
specific log types:

```

fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @type = "REPORT"
| pattern @message
| anomaly
```

The `anomaly` command can be combined with sorting to organize
results:

```

fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @type = "ERROR"
| pattern @message
| anomaly
| sort @timestamp desc
```
