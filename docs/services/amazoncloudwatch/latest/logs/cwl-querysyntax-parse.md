# parse

Use `parse` to extract data from a log field and create an
extracted field that you can process in your query.
**`parse`** supports both glob mode
using wildcards, and regular expressions. For information about regular
expression syntax, see [Supported regular expressions (regex) syntax](filterandpatternsyntax.md#regex-expressions).

You can parse nested JSON fields with a regular expression.

**Example: Parsing a nested JSON**
**field**

The code snippet shows how to parse a JSON log event that's been
flattened during ingestion.

```

{'fieldsA': 'logs', 'fieldsB': [{'fA': 'a1'}, {'fA': 'a2'}]}
```

The code snippet shows a query with a regular expression that extracts
the values for `fieldsA` and `fieldsB` to create the
extracted fields `fld` and `array`.

```

parse @message "'fieldsA': '*', 'fieldsB': ['*']" as fld, array
```

**Named capturing groups**

When you use **`parse`** with a regular
expression, you can use named capturing groups to capture a pattern into a
field. The syntax is `parse @message
                                (?<Name>pattern)`

The following example uses a capturing group on a VPC flow log to extract
the ENI into a field named `NetworkInterface`.

```

parse @message /(?<NetworkInterface>eni-.*?) / | display NetworkInterface, @message
```

###### Note

JSON log events are flattened during ingestion. Currently, parsing
nested JSON fields with a glob expression isn't supported. You can only
parse JSON log events that include no more than 200 log event fields.
When you parse nested JSON fields, you must format the regular
expression in your query to match the format of your JSON log event.

## Examples of the parse command

**Use a glob expression to extract the fields**
**`@user`, `@method`, and**
**`@latency` from the log field `@message`**
**and return the average latency for each unique combination of**
**`@method` and `@user`.**

```nohighlight

parse @message "user=*, method:*, latency := *" as @user,
    @method, @latency | stats avg(@latency) by @method,
    @user
```

**Use a regular expression to extract the fields**
**`@user2`, `@method2`, and**
**`@latency2` from the log field `@message`**
**and return the average latency for each unique combination of**
**`@method2` and `@user2`.**

```nohighlight

parse @message /user=(?<user2>.*?), method:(?<method2>.*?),
    latency := (?<latency2>.*?)/ | stats avg(latency2) by @method2,
    @user2
```

**Extracts the fields `loggingTime`,**
**`loggingType` and `loggingMessage`,**
**filters down to log events that contain `ERROR` or**
**`INFO` strings, and then displays only the**
**`loggingMessage` and `loggingType` fields**
**for events that contain an `ERROR`**
**string.**

```nohighlight

FIELDS @message
    | PARSE @message "* [*] *" as loggingTime, loggingType, loggingMessage
    | FILTER loggingType IN ["ERROR", "INFO"]
    | DISPLAY loggingMessage, loggingType = "ERROR" as isError
```
