1. Operations data from multiple refineries stream into the LUMINAI Refinery Advisor System on AWS.

2. **Application Load Balancer** on a public subnet directs data stream to the sensor processing
    pipeline on a private subnet.

3. Stream data ingestion processes running on **Amazon ECS** direct streams to
    **Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka** (Amazon MSK), which ingests and processes streaming data in real time at
    scale and directs it to ETL jobs running on **Amazon EMR**. As each job
    completes its task, results are stored on **Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL** and placed on
    **Amazon MQ**, a highly performant and scalable message queuing service.

4. LUMINAI’s Orchestrator and Reasoner business services run on **Amazon ECS** and
    process messages on **Amazon MQ**. Both business services leverage
    AI-driven algorithms to provide real-time insights into each refinery.

5. Processed data from business services are stored on **Aurora PostgreSQL** and are made
    available to web UI, API, and BI tools. Long-term data is stored on **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3).

6. Users can access the refineries' operational data and have a holistic view of each refinery through a web browser.
    LUMINAI provides access to refinery data through a web UI or APIs.

7. Authorized clients such as plant and operations managers, maintenance teams, and data scientists and
    engineers can access information by using BI tools.
