# Powering Multiple Contact Centers with GenAI Using Amazon Bedrock

Publication date: **October 4, 2023 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

Many contact center operators have a hybrid setup of using multiple vendors,
where each contact center has its own artificial intelligence and machine learning
(AI/ML) support. This architecture is designed to consolidate this support to a
single AI/ML stack for multiple contact center instances, powering multiple contact
centers by a single large language model (LLM) using Amazon Bedrock, thus
reducing cost and improving efficiency.

01. Call ingestion from a Genesys cloud contact center is achieved using an
     AudioHook websocket; call processing is handled using
     **Amazon Transcribe**.

02. **Amazon Connect** is an end-to-end
     cloud based contact center solution with built-in AI/ML capabilities.
     Call processing is done by using **Amazon Connect**
     Contact Lens.

03. Any other contact center based on session recording protocol (SIPREC)
     ingestion can be done by using **Amazon Chime**
     Voice Connector, with call processing by **Amazon Transcribe**.

04. **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** streams all call transcripts
     simultaneously from all contact center instances.

05. **AWS Lambda** is used to initiate
     **Amazon Comprehend** sentiment analysis, which
     determines agent and caller sentiment. **Lambda**
     also initiates agent assist and transcript summarization.

06. Agent assist is based on **Amazon Lex** and
     **Amazon Kendra**. **Amazon Lex**
     is the conversational interface and uses **Lambda**
     to activate **Amazon Kendra** to provide intelligent search.

07. The event call processor **Lambda** function invokes
     the transcript summarization **Lambda** function when
     the call ends to generate a summary of the call from full transcript.

08. The LLM hosted in **Amazon Bedrock** leverages
     retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with **Amazon Kendra**
     to securely ingest enterprise data into LLMs and fine tune it.

09. The post call summary **Lambda** hook that the
     LCA call event/transcript processor will invoke after the call summary is
     processed. This updates the call summary to a CRM system like Salesforce.

10. The web application establishes a secure GraphQL connection to the
     **AWS AppSync** API and subscribes to
     receive real-time events, such as new calls and call status changes
     for the calls list page, and new or updated transcription segments
     and computed analytics for the call details page.

11. **Amazon CloudFront** hosts a custom dashboard
     application for agents.
