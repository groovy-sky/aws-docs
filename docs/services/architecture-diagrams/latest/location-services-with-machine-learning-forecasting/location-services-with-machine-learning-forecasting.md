# Location Services with Real-Time ML Forecasting

Publication date: **September 19, 2023 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This reference architecture provides guidance on creating a
provider-customer location-based platform to create a real-time
inference pipeline to forecast demand.

## Sample Web Application Diagram

This reference architecture provides guidance on creating a
provider-customer location-based platform (in this case, a taxi
hailing service) using Amazon Location Service, Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon SageMaker AI to
create a real-time inference pipeline to forecast demand.

01. A customer hails a taxi by using the website and mobile app, which
     are hosted in an **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3) bucket.

02. The website is served using an **Amazon CloudFront**
     distribution, protected by **AWS WAF**
     with authentication provided by **Amazon Cognito**.

03. Requests are made to an **AWS Lambda** backed
     API, allowing the user to manage the request. An **Amazon**
    **Location Service** geofence is set around the customer using
     their location data.

04. Providers (such as taxi drivers) use a mobile application that uses
     the **Amazon Location Service** SDK to
     broadcast their location, and set statuses (available, offline, busy).

05. Using the **Amazon Location Service**
     route calculator, the nearest taxi driver to the user is found.
     A route is plotted between user and driver and shown to the customer
     on an **Amazon Location Service** map.

06. As the taxi driver nears the user’s location and enters the
     user’s geofence, an **Amazon EventBridge** rule reacts
     and sends a SMS or notification alert to the user.

07. Events such as location tracking and geofence creation are persisted
     in an **Amazon S3** bucket through **Amazon Data Firehose**
     for use in operational monitoring and analytics.

08. The API stores states into **Amazon DynamoDB** tables
     and job update activity generates **DynamoDB Streams** events.

09. **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** captures these events for
     real-time analytics.

10. Job data in **DynamoDB** is also streamed into
     an **Amazon S3** bucket for persistence and analytics.

## Real-Time ML Forecasting Diagram

Using the data collected from the sample web application, AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, and Amazon Quick transform
and analyze the data for business analytics and data exploration. This data is also used as part of a
full-machine learning (ML) lifecycle with Amazon SageMaker AI.

![Reference architecture diagram showing how to use the data collected to transform and analyze the data for business analytics and data exploration.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/location-services-with-machine-learning-forecasting/images/2-real-time-ml-forecasting.png)

1. An **AWS Glue** workflow is started
    with an **Amazon EventBridge** event when new objects
    are put into the geofence location and job management **Amazon S3** buckets.

2. An **AWS Glue** crawler analyzes and categorizes
    data and infers schema to populate an **AWS Glue Data Catalog**.
    The **AWS Glue** crawler incrementally crawls the data,
    but only processes data in the **Amazon S3** buckets that
    were added since the last crawl.

3. An **AWS Glue** ETL job is run periodically to convert
    the source data to a Parquet columnar data format. The data is sent to a
    processed data **Amazon S3** bucket and uses the
    **Data Catalog** and a crawler for metadata.

4. Data scientists and engineers use **Athena** to query
    the processed data with SQL statements as part of the data exploration stage of
    a machine learning lifecycle.

5. **Quick** provides visualization for the processed
    data to show operational location-based insights. Data for **Quick**
    is refreshed incrementality within a look-back window of time as new data arrives.

6. Data from the processed data **Amazon S3** bucket is
    used to train a spatial-temporal machine learning model in **Amazon SageMaker AI**.

7. A **SageMaker AI** serverless inference endpoint is used to
    deploy the trained model. The serverless endpoint scales with prediction traffic
    changes.

8. A predict demand location **Lambda** function provides
    real-time information to the provider’s mobile application by using **Amazon API Gateway**,
    ensuring they can be in the right place at the right time to serve customers.

## Full ML Lifecycle with a Spatial Temporal Model Diagram

The accuracy of the spatial-temporal machine learning model used for real-time forecasting might decrease
over time as new trends form (for example, increased demand in a new location or time period). This diagram
outlines best practices around MLOps using Amazon SageMaker AI Studio. Using an Amazon SageMaker AI Projects project, you
can automatically create model building and model deployment pipelines, experiments, model groups,
endpoints, and repositories.

1. An **Amazon SageMaker AI Pipelines** pipeline is started
    when a member of a data science team or data engineering team commits new code
    to an **AWS CodeCommit** repository to build the model.

2. The ML model begins retraining, including starting a data pre-processing processing
    job to create features from the data cleaned by the team. The model is then trained
    on this data.

3. After the model is trained, the model is evaluated against metrics such as
    Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error (WMAPE) by using a processing job.

4. If model evaluation is successful, it is registered with **Amazon SageMaker AI Model Registry**
    under a model group. As a model is continuously retrained, subsequent versions appear under the model group.

5. **AWS CodePipeline** is initiated when the model is successfully
    registered and versioned. This starts the model deployment process with a **CodeCommit**
    repository as a source.

6. After the model deploys, artifacts are built, the updated model is deployed to a staging
    serverless endpoint, and then a team of data scientists can test the model’s inference.

7. Data scientists use **CodePipeline** to manually approve the deployment
    after testing and validation. The model is then promoted and deployed to the production
    serverless endpoint. **Amazon SageMaker AI Serverless Inference** allows deployment
    of the model without selecting instance types or creating scaling policies.

8. Using an **Amazon SageMaker AI Model Monitor**, you can continuously
    measure the model for prediction performance; **Model Monitor** also
    allows for model bias, model explainability, and data quality monitoring.
