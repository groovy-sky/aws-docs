# Moodle for High Availability on AWS

Publication date: **December 22, 2021 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

Moodle is an open source learning management system (LMS) that supports distributed online learning.
When implemented on AWS, Moodle can scale flexibly to optimize cost and maximize availability.
We recommend separation of the application and database layers to enable autoscaling for elasticity.
Instructors and students can focus on teaching and learning, and organizations can reduce administrative
overhead by building a highly available Moodle architecture on AWS.

![Reference architecture diagram showing you how to implement Moodle on AWS.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/moodle-for-high-availability-on-aws/images/moodle-for-high-availability-on-aws.png)

01. **Amazon Route 53** provides highly available routing
     policies and directs students to the closest **Amazon CloudFront** locations to access
     static content, reducing latency.

02. Use **AWS Certificate Manager** to manage your SSL certificates for secure communication
     with public and private resources.

03. The public **Application Load Balancer** scales automatically with your student traffic
     and keeps in-flight student data secure with HTTPS and SSL termination.

04. The **NAT gateway** provides a pathway to external entities and platforms should that be
     required.

05. Run the Moodle platform application layer on **Amazon Elastic Container Service**
     (Amazon ECS), leveraging **AWS Fargate**, the serverless compute engine for containers.
     **Fargate** removes the need to provision and manage servers, lets you specify and pay for
     resources per application, and improves security through application isolation by design.

06. **Amazon ElastiCache** allows you to set up, run, and scale popular open-source compatible
     in-memory data stores in the cloud. Use multi-AZ **ElastiCache** in your Moodle architecture
     to provide automated disaster recovery.

07. **Amazon Elastic File System** (Amazon EFS) provides a serverless, set-and-forget, elastic
     file system that lets you share file data without provisioning or managing storage.

08. **Amazon Aurora** provides a MySQL or PostgreSQL compatible solution for Moodle relational
     database workloads.

09. **AWS Secrets Manager** helps you protect secrets needed to access your applications, services,
     and IT resources.

10. **Amazon Elastic Container Registry** (ECR) is a fully managed container registry that
     makes it easy to store, manage, share, and deploy your container images and artifacts
     anywhere.
