This architecture diagram helps you learn how to transfer life sciences data files to the cloud and provide data access using
Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Life Sciences Data Collection, Storage, and Processing Diagram

![Reference architecture diagram showing how you can use AWS services to transfer life sciences data files to the cloud and provide data access.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/life-sciences-data-collection-storage-processing/images/life-sciences-data-collection-storage-processing.png)

1. A lab technician runs an experiment and results
    are written to a folder on an on-premises file
    server. An AWS DataSync task is set up to sync the
    data from local storage to a bucket in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

2. Data is transferred to AWS Cloud either through
    the internet, or through a low-latency direct
    connection that avoids the internet, such as AWS Direct Connect.

3. On-premises researchers analyze data in Amazon S3 in existing bioinformatics tools by using
    Network File System (NFS) or Server Message
    Block (SMB) through Amazon S3 File Gateway.

4. Partnering entities like a contract research
    organization (CRO) can upload study results to
    Amazon S3 by using AWS Transfer Family for FTP, SFTP,
    or FTPS.

5. You can optimize storage by writing instruments
    that run data to an S3 bucket configured for
    infrequent access. Identify your S3 storage access
    patterns to optimally configure your S3 bucket
    lifecycle policy and transfer data to Amazon Glacier.

6. Using Amazon FSx for Lustre, data is made
    accessible to high performance computing (HPC)
    on the cloud for genomics, imaging, and other
    intensive workloads to provide a low millisecond-
    latency shared file system.

7. Research HPC workloads are orchestrated on the
    cloud with AWS Step Functions and AWS Batch,
    for flexible central processing unit (CPU) and
    graphics processing unit (GPU) computing on
    Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
    instances or Amazon Elastic Container Service
    (Amazon ECS) containers.

8. Machine learning is conducted with a common
    artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)
    toolkit that uses Amazon SageMaker AI for feature
    engineering, data labeling, model training,
    deployment and ML operations. Amazon Athena
    is used for flexible SQL queries with existing tools.
