# Edit in the Cloud on AWS

Publication date: **June 12, 2022 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This architecture helps you build a virtual, video editing environment on AWS to
collaborate with your editors and creative professionals. This architecture can also be [deployed on AWS](../../../solutions/latest/edit-in-the-cloud-on-aws/welcome.md) using an CloudFormation template that launches, configures, and runs the AWS services
required to deploy this solution using AWS best practices for security and
availability.

## Edit in the Cloud on AWS

![Reference architecture diagram showing how you can use AWS services to help you build a virtual, video editing environment on AWS to collaborate with your editors and creative professionals.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/edit-in-cloud-on-aws/images/edit-in-cloud-on-aws.png)

1. An **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud** (Amazon EC2) instance for Windows Server 2019
    with Teradici Cloud Access Software or NICE DCV and NVIDIA T4 GPU drivers for running your
    Non-Linear Editor (NLE) software of choice. During deployment, the solution gives you the
    option to install either Teradici’s Cloud Access Software, or NICE DCV. Users can then
    access the cloud workstation using either Teradici’s PC-over-IP (PCoIP) client or the NICE
    DCV client, accordingly.

2. **AWS Directory Service** for user authentication.

3. **Amazon FSx for Windows File Server** to access digital assets via the
    **Amazon EC2** instance through your editor of choice. **FSx for Windows File Server** will auto-mount the network share upon startup of
    the Windows **Amazon EC2** instance. **FSx for Windows File Server** will be used for storing your media assets to be used by your
    non-linear editor (NLE).
