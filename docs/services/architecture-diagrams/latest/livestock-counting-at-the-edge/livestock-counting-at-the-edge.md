# Livestock Counting at the Edge

Publication date: **July 12, 2022 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This architecture enables you to build a near real-time, automated counting application for
livestock. Use **Amazon SageMaker AI** and **AWS IoT Greengrass** to build and deploy a livestock counting application at the edge.

1. Upload videos and images to **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3) to train
    the livestock detection model.

2. Use **Amazon SageMaker AI** **Notebooks** to process these videos and create a labelling
    job using **Amazon SageMaker AI** **Ground Truth**.

3. Split the annotated dataset into training and validation sets, and use **Amazon SageMaker AI** distributed training for livestock detection.

4. Use **Amazon SageMaker AI** **Neo** to optimize the livestock detection model for
    specific target devices like NVIDIA Jetson Nano, TX2, Xavier, **AWS DeepLens** , or Raspberry Pi.

5. Deploy the machine learning model and counting application **AWS Lambda** function to the edge device using **AWS IoT Greengrass**.

6. Consume live video streams from a camera at the farm using real-time streaming
    protocol (RTSP) through camera serial interface (CSI) or through USB connected to the edge
    hardware.

7. Run ML Inference on the video frames from step 6 and pass the bounding box outputs to
    the counting application **Lambda** function.

8. Connect to the web server running on edge devices and control when to start/stop
    counting through a mobile application.

9. Submit near real-time counts to an inventory management system.
