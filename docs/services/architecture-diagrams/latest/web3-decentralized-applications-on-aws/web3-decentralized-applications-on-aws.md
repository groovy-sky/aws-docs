## Web3 Decentralized Applications on AWS Diagram

1. The browser makes a requests to the **Amazon CloudFront**
    domain, routed to the closest distribution for the Decentralized Application (DApp).

2. The DApp is cached at the edge in **CloudFront**. The
    DApp files are distributed to the edge by a **CloudFront**
    distribution that makes a request to an **Amazon Simple Storage Service**
    (Amazon S3) bucket, where the DApp files are statically hosted.

    The **Amazon S3** bucket is secured by blocking all traffic except
    for a configured origin Access Identity of the CloudFront Distribution. Refer to
    [Restricting \
    access to an Amazon S3 origin](../../../amazoncloudfront/latest/developerguide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.md).

3. The DApp makes requests to the **Amazon API Gateway** from the browser.

4. All requests to the **API Gateway** are sent to the **AWS Lambda**
    DApp Backend. It reads the path and method requests and binds them into a Web3.js request
    with a sigv4 signed Http Request Provider.

5. **Amazon Managed Blockchain** Ethereum Node
    receives and processes Web3 requests.

6. Ethereum requests and transactions are propagated to and received
    from the decentralized Ethereum Blockchain Mainnet.
