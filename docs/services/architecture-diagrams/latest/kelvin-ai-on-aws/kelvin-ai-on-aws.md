1. Time-series data from industrial historians or industrial gateway/programmable
    logic controllers (PLCs) leveraging MQTT, OPC-UA, and Modbus protocols are sent
    to the edge nodes.

2. The solution consists of a streaming data broker for time series data, a node
    historian for short-term time series data store, an edge sync module that syncs
    edge node with the cloud after loss of connectivity. The solution also manages
    workload orchestration using connectivity brokers, node telemetry, and services
    for asset models and their configuration.

3. Kelvin Manager manages the edge nodes and deploys Kelvin Bridges (connectors)
    or custom Python apps, users, assets, and metric definitions.

4. Kelvin SDK is used to develop, configure, deploy and manage services, with
    both a CLI and a library framework to develop apps.

5. Kelvin cluster is built on **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service** (Amazon EKS)
    and hosts the Kelvin platform. It consists of streaming data brokers, cloud
    historians, APIs, and integration services. Control changes are processed and
    sent to the industrial gateway/PLC through edge nodes from the platform.

6. Kelvin Nodes run on **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud** (Amazon EC2) to
    ingest telemetry data already in the AWS account.

7. Kelvin Maps allows users to visualize processes, asset performance,
    time-series data, and alarms. Copilots is a specialized user experience
    solution aimed at specific tasks or industries.

8. **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3) can be used to store asset
    hierarchy and time-series data that is ingested by Kelvin Nodes. Kelvin can
    push data to **AWS IoT SiteWise**. It integrates with
    **Amazon Quick** as an alternative to Kelvin Maps.
    Integration with **Amazon SageMaker AI** allows for creating
    and importing customer algorithms to deploy on Kelvin Nodes.

9. The Kelvin platform in the cloud stores asset information and user profiles
    in **Amazon Relational Database Service** (Amazon RDS), while **Amazon Simple Notification Service**
    (Amazon SNS) is used to initiate alarm notifications to end users.
