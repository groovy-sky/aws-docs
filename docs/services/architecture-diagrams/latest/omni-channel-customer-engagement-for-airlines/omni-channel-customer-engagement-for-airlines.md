1. Use **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3) to store website, configuration
    files, and **Amazon CloudFront** to serve a unified user interface.

2. Invoke **AWS Lambda** to provide personalized
    recommendations for travelers and generate data through **Amazon API Gateway**. API access is controlled through **Amazon Cognito**.

3. Serverless database architecture runs on **Amazon DynamoDB** to
    collect key Traveler 360 data from several sources, personalization data processing
    workload outputs, and systems of records.

4. A chatbot powered by **Amazon Lex** asks for traveler
    input data and automates the delivery of personalized user interactions and
    recommendations.

5. Use a search service for available products to recommend in the data bank index by
    using **Amazon OpenSearch Service**.

6. Use a mail or mobile push notification service to send recommendations to travelers,
    scheduled through **Amazon Pinpoint**.
