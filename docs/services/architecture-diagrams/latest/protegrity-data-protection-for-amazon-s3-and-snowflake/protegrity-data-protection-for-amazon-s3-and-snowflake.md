# Protegrity Data Protection for Amazon S3 and Snowflake

Publication date: **October 12, 2023 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This architecture shows how Protegrity on AWS can be used to protect sensitive data in Amazon S3 and then show the same data as clear text based on permissions from Snowflake.

## Protegrity Data Protection for Amazon S3 and Snowflake Diagram

![Reference architecture diagram showing how Protegrity on AWS can be used to protect sensitive data in Amazon S3 and then show the same data as clear text based on permissions from Snowflake.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/protegrity-data-protection-for-amazon-s3-and-snowflake/images/protegrity-data-protection-for-amazon-s3-and-snowflake.png)

1. External Files are sent to an **Amazon S3** (Amazon S3)
    input bucket by **AWS DataSync**.

2. The **Amazon S3** Protegrity accelerator that was
    built using **AWS Lambda** is initiated
    by an **Amazon S3** event. The accelerator
    reads the data from the **Amazon S3** bucket
    and invokes the Protegrity Cloud API protector.

3. Protegrity Cloud API protector, which was built using **Lambda**,
    applies data protection on the data. The Protegrity Cloud API protector
    returns protected (encrypted or tokenized) data if the passed user has
    the right permissions.

4. The **Amazon S3** Protegrity accelerator receives
    the protected data and creates a new object in the output **Amazon S3**
    bucket (data lake). Optionally, data is deleted from the raw data bucket.

5. Data from the **Amazon S3** data lake is loaded
    into a Snowflake table by a Snowflake virtual warehouse. A masking policy
    is applied on that table.

6. When a user queries a dataset containing protected data, Snowflake’s
    masking policy invokes the Protegrity Snowflake protector by using
    an external function. This process is managed by a Snowflake virtual
    warehouse. It’s worth noting the distinct workload isolation and immediate
    scaling capability of Snowflake, as demonstrated in steps 5 and 6, through
    independently scalable virtual warehouses.

7. The Snowflake external function call goes through **Amazon API Gateway**.
    The authorization of this service is achieved using Snowflake’s API integration
    object, which encompasses **API Gateway** and trusted
    roles created for REST API egress from Snowflake's **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud** (Amazon VPC) to the
    customer’s AWS account. The Protegrity protector returns clear text data for
    users with the right permissions.
