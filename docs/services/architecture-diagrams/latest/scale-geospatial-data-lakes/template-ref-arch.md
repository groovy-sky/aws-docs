# Scale Geospatial Data Lakes on AWS

Publication date: **August 14, 2023 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

Repositories of geospatial data are becoming [increasingly important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74ayGG6SZLw) in
many organizations – for use in everything from logistics and insurance to supply chain optimization. This reference architecture
shows you how to build scalable geospatial data repositories on AWS. It simplifies the design of geospatial data pipelines,
allowing accelerated access to raw data by integrating AWS-managed datasets from the [Registry of \
Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/), eliminating the need to store it on your data lake. It integrates with a variety of
dissemination mechanisms and supports diverse processing demands.

1. Initiate a data ingestion pipeline based on new scene detection.
    Subscribe to **Amazon Simple Notification Service** (Amazon SNS) topics
    for managed datasets with appropriate filters.

    A time-based event can be configured using **Amazon CloudWatch** rules to
    begin ingestion during specific time windows.

2. **AWS Lambda** queries the [SpatioTemporal \
    Asset Catalogs (STAC) API](https://stacspec.org/en) for a respective dataset to get product details. It initiates the data processing
    pipeline through **AWS Step Functions**.

3. **Step Functions** orchestrates the processing tasks. Parallel
    or sequential processing can be configured based on task characteristics and
    requirements.

4. **Amazon Elastic Container Service** (Amazon ECS) runs containerized tasks to:

- Download the products from datasets hosted on the Registry of Open Data on AWS.

- Process (crop and geomosiac) the tiles to area of interest and store them in **Amazon Simple Storage Service**
(Amazon S3) aoi-processed bucket. Build metadata and store them in **Amazon DynamoDB**.
Store vector data in **Amazon Aurora** Postgres with PostGIS extensions.

5. **Step Functions** initiates the next processing task with **Amazon SageMaker AI**.

6. **SageMaker AI**-hosted ML models perform cloud removal and band math.

7. **Amazon WorkSpaces** hosted GIS workbenches can be used for
    visualization. The data is stored in an **Amazon S3** preprocessed bucket.
