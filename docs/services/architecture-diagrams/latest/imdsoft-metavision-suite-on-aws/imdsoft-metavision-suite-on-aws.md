# iMDSoft MetaVision Suite on AWS

Publication date: **November 28, 2022 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This architecture helps you deploy MetaVision Suite on AWS. MetaVision Suite by iMDSoft is a clinical information system designed to support the delivery of care in adult, neonatal, and pediatric intensive care units (ICU) with [MetaVision ICU](https://imd-soft.com/metavision/icu), as well as anesthesia and operation theatres with [MetaVision OR](https://imd-soft.com/metavision/anesthesia).

###### Note

This architecture is provided for reference only, and is to be used accordingly. Actual deployment architecture will depend upon the availability of services, end customer requirements, solution features, and sizing.

1. Hospital users access MetaVision Suite using Citrix client workstations. Bedside devices communicate through a serial server with the MetaVision Integration Engine (MVIE) instance on AWS. The Emergency Data Access Workstations (EDA) provide a disaster capability in case of loss of connectivity.

2. Hospital sites use redundant **AWS Direct Connect** connections to access AWS. Data is encrypted
    in transit with TLS.

3. MetaVision Application Server is deployed on **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud** (Amazon EC2) instances with Citrix across multiple Availability Zones
    (AZs).

4. The MVIE is a communication server responsible for connectivity to hospital devices as
    well as other clinical and administration systems. MVIE server is hosted on **Amazon EC2** **Windows Server** instances across multiple Availability
    Zones, and is set up as a Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC) for high availability.

5. The MetaVision Database stores data from medical devices, hospital systems and data
    entered by clinicians. It uses SQL Server deployed on **Amazon EC2** instances. [SQL Server Always\
    On Failover Cluster Instances (FCIs)](../../../prescriptive-guidance/latest/migration-sql-server/ec2-fci.md) are configured across Availability Zones to
    achieve high availability.

6. A standalone SQL Server replica on **Amazon EC2** serves
    reporting requirements as well as data synchronization with EDA workstations.

7. **Amazon FSx for Windows File Server** file shares provide shared storage
    for the SQL Server instances, as well as file-share witness for the Failover Cluster
    Instances (FCIs).

8. Transactional replication is used to synchronize the on-premises EDA workstations continuously.
