# PTC Creo on Amazon WorkSpaces Applications – EC2-based File Share for Users

Publication date: **March 24, 2022 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This architecture gives you a blueprint for providing secure access to [PTC Creo](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/creo) hosted in the AWS Cloud using Amazon S3 for the private user folder, and an EC2-based file share folder for collaboration with other users before committing their computer-aided designs (CADs) into [PTC Windchill product lifecycle management](https://d1.awsstatic.com/architecture-diagrams/ArchitectureDiagrams/ptc-windchill-plm-on-aws.pdf?mfgr_ed3=) (PLM).

## PTC Creo on Amazon WorkSpaces Applications – EC2-based File Share for Users

1. Windows Bastion Host running on an **Amazon EC2** instance is
    used by administrators to log on to instances in the private subnet.

2. Images created by **Amazon AppStream** are provisioned in the
    private subnet that will be used in the generation of the **Amazon AppStream** fleet.

3. Global Creo License Manger running on **Amazon EC2** instances
    is used by **Amazon AppStream** fleet instances that are being
    generated. Licenses are consumed when **Amazon AppStream** instances are
    created and licenses released after **Amazon AppStream** instances are
    deprecated.

4. The **Amazon WorkSpaces Applications** fleet is created in private subnets in
    two different Availability Zones that users connect to, either on an on-demand or
    always-on basis.

5. Users connect to the **Amazon AppStream** fleet instances using a
    web browser, or **Amazon WorkSpaces Applications** Windows Client.

6. A file share based on **Amazon EC2** instances backed by
    **Amazon Elastic Block Store** (Amazon EBS) volumes is created for users to use a
    common server message block (SMB) share for collaboration, before committing the final
    CADs into the PTC Windchill file vault.

7. In the process of setting up the **Amazon WorkSpaces Applications** stack,
    users can select an **Amazon S3** folder as a private folder for
    each user to persist application settings, user data, and files.
