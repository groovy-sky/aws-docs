# DescribeForMe Web App

Publication date: **September 1, 2023 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

The [DescribeForMe](https://www.describeforme.com/) web app uses the AWS Cloud to help the visually impaired review images.
Through the use of multiple artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) services, you
can submit a photo and an image caption will be read back to you in a clear, natural-sounding
voice in a variety of languages and dialects.

1. **AWS Amplify** distributes the DescribeForMe
    web app, consisting of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, to your mobile device.

2. The **Amazon Cognito** identity pool grants temporary access
    to the **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3) bucket.

3. The user uploads an image file to the **Amazon S3** bucket
    using an AWS SDK through the web app.

4. The DescribeForMe web app invokes the backend AI services by sending
    the **Amazon S3** object key in the payload
    to **Amazon API Gateway**.

5. **API Gateway** instantiates an **AWS Step Functions**
    workflow. The state machine orchestrates the AI/ML services **Amazon Rekognition**,
    **Amazon SageMaker AI**, **Amazon Textract**,
    **Amazon Translate**, and **Amazon Polly**
    using **AWS Lambda** functions.

6. The **Step Functions** workflow creates an audio file as output and
    stores it in **Amazon S3** in MP3 format.

7. A pre-signed URL with the location of the audio file stored in **Amazon S3**
    is sent back to your browser through **Amazon API Gateway**. Your mobile
    device plays the audio file using the pre-signed URL.
