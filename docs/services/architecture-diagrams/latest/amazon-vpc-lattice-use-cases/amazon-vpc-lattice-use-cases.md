# Amazon VPC Lattice Reference Architectures

Publication date: **October 16, 2023 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

Amazon VPC Lattice is an application layer service that consistently connects,
monitors, and secures communications between your services. This series shows
different connectivity patterns for multi-AWS account environments.

## Components Diagram

VPC Lattice gives you a consistent way to connect, secure, and monitor communication
between your services, across AWS compute services (instances, containers,
and serverless functions). This diagram will show you the different components
in VPC Lattice and how they interact within each other.

1. A _service network_ is logical boundary for a collection of services.
    Services associated with the network can be authorized for discovery,
    connectivity, accessibility, and observability. To make requests to
    services in the network, the client must be in a VPC that is associated
    with the service network.

2. A _service_ represents an independently deployable unit of software that
    delivers a specific task or function. Each service has a listener that
    uses rules to target to one or several target groups. Targets can be
    **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud** (Amazon EC2) instances, IP
    addresses, **AWS Lambda** functions,
    Application Load Balancers, or Kubernetes Pods.

3. When a service is associated to a service network, it enables clients to
    make requests to this service, but only if the VPC where the client is
    located is associated as well to the service network, and the policies
    allow it.

4. When you do a _VPC association_ with the service network, it enables all
    the targets within that VPC to be clients and communicate with other
    services in the service network. A security group can be attached to
    this association to control the network access from the VPC, while
    service network or service policies can be used to apply fine grained
    access controls.

5. You can use _auth policies_ both in the service network or services
    to configure access control.

## Traffic Flow Diagram

VPC Lattice is designed to help you easily and effectively discover, secure,
connect, and monitor all of the services within it. The Amazon Route 53 VPC Resolver
is used within the consumer VPC to resolve the VPC Lattice service’s domain names,
resolving to link-local addresses to send traffic locally to the service network.

![Diagram showing how to easily and effectively discover, secure, connect, and monitor all of the services within it.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/amazon-vpc-lattice-use-cases/images/2-traffic-flow.png)

1. The consumer application placed in the **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud**
    (Amazon EC2) instance queries the **Amazon Route 53**
    VPC Resolver to get domain name resolution of _service1_.

2. DNS resolution determines that the traffic should be sent to the service
    network (link-local addresses). The first traffic control measure is a
    security group attached to the VPC association (you can attach more
    than one security group).

3. If the requested **VPC Lattice** service is
    associated with the service network that is associated with the consumer
    VPC and the service network policy allows communication to it, traffic
    will be forwarded to the specific target.

4. In this example, _service1_ only has one target group
    (routed by default) which is an Application Load Balancer (ALB). This ALB will forward the
    traffic to the corresponding **Amazon EC2** instance.

## Custom Domain Name for a VPC Lattice Service Diagram

When creating VPC Lattice services, you can configure a custom domain name
to provide a more intuitive URL for your users. When a client makes a
request using your custom domain name, the DNS server resolves it to
the VPC Lattice-generated domain name (service-name-service\_id.partition\_id.vpc-lattice-svcs.region.on.aws).
However, this happens only if you map your custom domain name to
the VPC Lattice-generated domain name (CNAME record).

![Diagram showing how to map your custom domain name to the VPC Lattice-generated domain name.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/amazon-vpc-lattice-use-cases/images/3-custom-domain-name.png)

1. To allow the mapping between your custom domain name and the **VPC Lattice**-generated
    domain name, create a private hosted zone associated to your consumer
    VPC. This hosted zone will contain the ALIAS record doing this mapping.

2. Optionally, to serve HTTPS requests, you must have your own SSL/TLS
    certificate ready in **AWS Certificate Manager**
    (ACM) when setting up a custom domain name.

3. The consumer application placed in the **Amazon EC2**
    instance queries the VPC resolver to get domain name resolution of
    _service1.example.com_. The **Route 53 Resolver** resolves the alias record, returning the appropriate **VPC Lattice**
    endpoint IP addresses directly, eliminating additional DNS lookups for the VPC resolver.

4. The application forwards the traffic to the **VPC Lattice** service network VPC association.

5. Because the requested **VPC Lattice** service
    is associated with the service network associated to the consumer VPC
    and the service network’s policy allows communication to it, traffic
    will be forwarded to the specific target.

6. In this example, _service1_ only has one target
    group (routed by default) which is an auto scaling group. Traffic
    will be forwarded to one of the **Amazon EC2**
    instances in the group.

## Multi-Account Centralized Single Service Network Diagram

A central account can have ownership of the service network, which is
shared (using AWS Resource Access Manager) to other AWS accounts inside
the same or different AWS Organizations. Additionally, the provider accounts
can also shared their services using AWS Resource Access Manager.

![Diagram showing how a central account can have ownership of the service network, which is shared (using AWS Resource Access Manager) to other AWS accounts inside the same or different AWS Organizations.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/amazon-vpc-lattice-use-cases/images/4-multi-account-centralized-single-service-network.png)

1. The consumer application placed in the **Amazon EC2**
    instance queries the VPC resolver to get domain name resolution of _service2_.

2. DNS resolution determines that the traffic should be sent to the service network.

3. In this example, both policies at the service network and service level
    allow traffic to the target (Auto Scaling group) from the consumer, so
    the application in the **Amazon EC2** instance can consume
    _service2_.

4. The consumer application gets the domain name resolution of _service1_.

5. The VPC resolver will resolve with the service network as next hop.
    However, in the example, either the policies at the service network
    or service level don’t allow the consumer to consume service1
    ( **Lambda** function), so the traffic
    is dropped.

## Multi-Account Centralized Multiple Service Networks Diagram

A central account can have ownership of several service networks, which
are shared (using AWS Resource Access Manager) to other AWS accounts,
inside the same or different AWS Organizations (same as services). The use of several
service networks allow for a segmentation of services, which can also be
achieved or complemented with the use of policies.

![Diagram showing how a central account can have ownership of several service networks, which are shared (using AWS Resource Access Manager) to other AWS accounts, inside the same or different AWS Organizations (same as services).](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/amazon-vpc-lattice-use-cases/images/5-multi-account-centralized-multiple-service-networks.png)

1. An **AWS Lambda** function placed in a
    VPC can access a service network after the VPC is associated to it.
    In this case, the consumer service located in the **Lambda**
    function queries the VPC resolver to resolve the domain name of _service1_.

2. DNS resolution determines that the traffic should be sent to service network 2.

3. Both policies at the service network and service level allow traffic to
    the target (Auto Scaling group) from the consumer, so the consumer application
    can consume the service.

4. The consumer application placed in an **Amazon EC2** instance
    queries the VPC resolver to resolve the domain name of the _service2_.
    This resolves in the **VPC Lattice** link-local addresses
    sending the traffic to the service network.

5. Because _service2_ is not associated to service
    network 1, the traffic is dropped.

## Multi-Account Distributed Service Networks Diagram

Each provider AWS account owns its own services, and shares them with
other AWS accounts, inside the same or different AWS Organizations. Because a
VPC can only be associated with one service network, consumers can own
its own service network and choose which services they want to consume.

![Diagram showing how each provider AWS account owns its own services and shares them with other AWS accounts, inside the same or different AWS Organizations.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/amazon-vpc-lattice-use-cases/images/6-multi-account-distributed-service-networks.png)

1. The consumer application – placed in an **Amazon EC2**
    instance – queries the VPC resolver for DNS resolution of _service1_.

2. DNS resolution determines that the traffic should be sent to service network 1.

3. Both policies at the service network and service level allow traffic to the
    target (a **Lambda** function) from the
    consumer, so the consumer application can consume service1.

4. A **Lambda** function placed in a VPC can
    access a service network after the VPC is associated to it. In this
    case, the consumer service located in the **Lambda**
    function queries the VPC resolver for DNS resolution of _service2_.

5. DNS resolution determines that the traffic should be sent to service network 2.

6. Both policies at the service network and service level allow traffic to
    the target (Auto Scaling group) from the consumer, so the consumer application
    can consume _service2_.
