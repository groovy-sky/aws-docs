# Traffic Segmentation Options in AWS Direct Connect

Publication date: **November 9, 2023 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This architecture shows traffic segmentation options in AWS Direct Connect, include using several
private VIFs in the VPC or Direct Connect gateway, using AWS Transit Gateway Connect attachments over
transit VIF, and using AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections over transit VIF.

## Segment Your Traffic over AWS Direct Connect by Using Several Private VIFs in the VPC or Direct Connect Gateway Diagram

![Reference architecture diagram showing how to segment your traffic over AWS Direct Connect by using several private VIFs in the VPC or Direct Connect Gateway.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/traffic-segmentation-aws-direct-connect/images/1-several-private-vifs.png)

Private virtual interfaces (VIFs) are used to access Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) using private IP addresses.
Each VIF is configured with an unique virtual local area network (VLAN) tag, which
means you can segment your traffic by using one VIF per virtual routing and
forwarding (VRF) you have in your data center. Take into account the limits in
the number of VIFs, depending the type of Direct Connect connection you have. You can
have 50 private or public VIFs with a dedicated connection, and one private
or public VIF with a hosted connection. In addition, you can have 30 private
VIFs associated to the same Direct Connect gateway. You can check the quotas in the
[Direct Connect user guide](../../../directconnect/latest/userguide/limits.md).

1. Traffic initiated from an instance in Spoke VPC A and destined for the
    corporate data center server (in VRF A) is routed to the virtual private
    gateway according to the Spoke VPC A route table.

2. The virtual private gateway is associated with the **Direct Connect**
    gateway, which uses a private VIF (VLAN) to connect to the corporate data center. To achieve
    segmentation, use several private VIFs. The on-premises router must be configured to
    use a different VIF (VLAN) connection per VRF configured.

3. The on-premises router forwards the traffic from private VIF A to
    VRF A and the destination server.

4. Traffic from the corporate data center’s VRF B destined for Spoke VPC B
    is first sent to the customer gateway located in the data center.

5. The customer gateway uses private VIF B – over the Direct Connect link – to
    send the traffic to the virtual private gateway in VPC B.

6. Traffic is forwarded to the destination according to the Spoke VPC B
    route table.

## Segment Your Traffic over AWS Direct Connect by Using Several Transit VIFs and Direct Connect Gateways Diagram

![Reference architecture diagram showing how to segment your traffic over AWS Direct Connect by using several transit VIFs and Direct Connect gateways.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/traffic-segmentation-aws-direct-connect/images/2-several-transit-vifs.png)

Transit Virtual Interfaces (VIFs) are used to access AWS Transit Gateway by way of
an Direct Connect gateway. Each VIF is configured with an unique virtual local
area network (VLAN) tag, which means you can segment your traffic by using
one VIF per virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) you have in your data
center. Take into account the limits in the number of VIFs, depending
the type of Direct Connect connection you have. You can have four transit VIFs
with a max combination of 51 private, public, and transit VIFs per
dedicated connection. For hosted connections, you can have only
one transit VIF. In addition, you can have 30 transit VIFs associated
with the same Direct Connect gateway. You can check the quotas in the
[Direct Connect user guide](../../../directconnect/latest/userguide/limits.md).

1. Traffic initiated from an instance in Spoke VPC A and destined for
    the corporate data center server (in VRF A) is routed to
    **AWS Transit Gateway** according to
    the Spoke VPC A route table.

2. Transit Gateway is associated with several Direct Connect gateways (DXGW), each one
    of them using a transit VIF (VLAN) to connect to the corporate
    data center, achieving traffic segmentation. The on-premises
    router must be configured to use a different VIF (VLAN) connection
    per VRF configured.

3. Traffic is forwarded to DXGW A according to the Segment A **Transit Gateway** route
    table associated with the VPC A attachment.

4. The on-premises router forwards the traffic from the transit
    VIF A to VRF A and the destination server.

5. Traffic from the corporate data center’s VRF B destined for
    Spoke VPC B is first sent to the customer gateway located
    in the data center.

6. The customer gateway uses transit VIF B – over the **Direct Connect**
    link – to send the traffic to **Transit Gateway** Segment B.

7. Traffic is forwarded to VPC B according to the Segment
    B **Transit Gateway** route table.

8. Traffic is forwarded to the destination
    according to the VPC B route table.

## Use AWS Transit Gateway Connect Attachments and AWS Direct Connect to Extend your On-Premises VRFs over Transit VIFs Diagram

![Reference architecture diagram showing how to use AWS Transit Gateway connect attachments and AWS Direct Connect to extend your on-premises VRFs over transit VIFs.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/traffic-segmentation-aws-direct-connect/images/3-extend-on-premises-vrfs-over-transit-vifs.png)

With a hosted connection, you get one transit VIF; with a dedicated connection you
get four. When you have more VRFs than transit VIFs, you can use several Transit Gateway
Connect attachments (GRE tunnels) over a transit VIF to segment the traffic,
creating one connect attachment per VRF you have in your data center. For more
information about this use case, refer to
[Using AWS Transit Gateway \
Connect to extend VRFs and increase IP prefix advertisement](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/using-aws-transit-gateway-connect-to-extend-vrfs-and-increase-ip-prefix-advertisement).

1. Traffic initiated from an instance in Spoke VPC A and destined for the
    corporate data center server (in VRF A) is routed to the **Transit Gateway** elastic
    network interface (TGW ENI) according to the Spoke VPC A route table.

2. Traffic is forwarded to **Transit Gateway**. Traffic is
    then routed to the corporate data center through the **Transit Gateway**
    Connect attachment A according to the Segment A route table.

3. The **Transit Gateway** Connect attachment uses
    the **Direct Connect** connection as transport and connects **Transit Gateway**
    to the corporate data center router using Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
    tunneling and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). The on-premises router must
    be configured to use a different connect attachment per VRF configured.

4. The on-premises router forwards the traffic from Connect attachment A to
    VRF A and the destination server.

5. Traffic from the corporate data center’s VRF B destined for Spoke VPC B is first
    sent to the customer gateway located in the data center.

6. The customer gateway uses the GRE tunnel of the **Transit Gateway**
    Connect attachment B – over the **Direct Connect** link – to
    send the traffic to **Transit Gateway**.

7. Traffic is forwarded to the Spoke VPC B attachment according to
    the **Transit Gateway** Segment B route table.

8. The TGW ENI of Spoke VPC B
    forwards the traffic to the destination.

## Use AWS Site-to-Site VPN Attachments (Public VIFs) and AWS Direct Connect to Extend Your On-Premises VRFs Diagram

![Reference architecture diagram showing how to use AWS Site-to-Site VPN VPN attachments (public VIFs) and AWS Direct Connect to extend your on-premises VRFs.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/traffic-segmentation-aws-direct-connect/images/4-extend-on-premises-vrfs.png)

If your customer gateway does not support Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), you
can still segment your traffic by creating one AWS Site-to-Site VPN
connection per each VRF you have in your data center. You can use a public VIF as underlaying transport.

1. Traffic initiated from an instance in Spoke VPC A and destined for the
    corporate data center server (in VRF A) is routed to the **Transit Gateway** elastic
    network interface (TGW ENI) according to the Spoke VPC A route table.

2. Traffic is forwarded to **Transit Gateway**. Traffic is then
    routed to the corporate data center through **Site-to-Site VPN** connection
    A according to the Segment A route table.

3. The **Site-to-Site VPN** connection is created using a public
    VIF as transport (VLAN). The on-premises router must be configured
    to use a different VPN connection per VRF configured.

4. The on-premises router forwards the traffic from **Site-to-Site VPN**
    connection A to the VRF A and the destination server.

5. Traffic from the corporate data center’s VRF B destined for Spoke VPC B is first
    sent to the customer gateway located in the data center.

6. The customer gateway chooses **Site-to-Site VPN** connection B to
    send the traffic to the **Transit Gateway** over
    the **Direct Connect** link.

7. Traffic is forwarded to the Spoke VPC B attachment according to
    the **Transit Gateway** Segment B route table.

8. The TGW ENI of Spoke VPC B forwards the traffic to the destination.

## Use AWS Site-to-Site VPN Private IP VPN Attachments and AWS Direct Connect to Extend Your On-Premises VRFs Over Transit VIFs Diagram

![Reference architecture diagram showing how to use AWS Site-to-Site VPN private IP VPN attachments and AWS Direct Connect to extend your on-premises VRFs over transit VIFs.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/traffic-segmentation-aws-direct-connect/images/5-extend-on-premises-vrfs-over-transit-vifs-private-ip.png)

If your customer gateway does not support GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation), you can still segment
your traffic by creating one AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection (with two tunnels) per each VRF you have in your
data center. With the Site-to-Site VPN Private IP VPN feature, you can create the VPNs using private
IPs with the AWS Direct Connect gateway and transit VIF as underlying transport.

1. Traffic initiated from an instance in Spoke VPC A and destined for the
    corporate data center server (in VRF A) is routed to the
    **AWS Transit Gateway** elastic network interface
    (TGW ENI) according to the Spoke VPC A route table.

2. Traffic is forwarded to **Transit Gateway**. Traffic is
    then routed to the corporate data center through **Transit Gateway**
    VPN attachment A according to the Segment A route table.

3. The **Transit Gateway** **Site-to-Site VPN**
    attachment uses the **Direct Connect** connection as transport,
    and connects **Transit Gateway** to the corporate data center
    router using one IPSec VPN connection (with two tunnels). The on-premises
    router must be configured to use a different VPN attachment per VRF configured.

4. The on-premises router forwards the traffic from VPN attachment A to VRF A
    and the destination server.

5. Traffic from the corporate data center’s VRF B destined for Spoke VPC B is
    first sent to the customer gateway located in the data center.

6. The customer gateway uses **Site-to-Site VPN**
    connection B – over the **Direct Connect**
    link – to send the traffic to **Transit Gateway**.

7. Traffic is forwarded to the Spoke VPC B attachment according to
    the **Transit Gateway** Segment B route table.

8. The TGW ENI of Spoke VPC B forwards the traffic to the destination.
