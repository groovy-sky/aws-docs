# Plagiarism Detection Architecture

Publication date: **July 26, 2021 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This architecture helps you create a plagiarism-detection service using AWS Step Functions, AWS Lambda, Amazon SageMaker AI, and OpenSearch Service.

## Plagiarism Detection Architecture Diagram

1. Copy the document you’d like to run plagiarism detection on to **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3).

2. **Amazon S3** event triggers start of **AWS Step Functions** workflow.

3. **AWS Lambda** function extracts text from document using
    Tika (a content analysis toolkit that detects and extracts metadata and text from over a
    thousand different file types.

4. For each paragraph in the document, text is passed to a pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based model to extract word embedding vectors.

5. For each word embedding vector, a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search is run using a cosine-similarity algorithm.

6. **Amazon OpenSearch Service** (OpenSearch Service) domain stores an index of
    pre-processed works that have been converted into word embedding vectors and indexed.

7. Based on the configured similarity threshold that is compared against the **OpenSearch Service** query result score, an event bridge event is raised,
    specifying source document information that has possibly been plagiarized with reference
    to relevant works.
