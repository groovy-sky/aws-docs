# Embedded ML models using Amazon SageMaker AI on AWS Marketplace

Publication date: **August 17, 2022 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This architecture creates an environment where a buyer can consume a seller’s application into their own virtual private cloud (VPC), protecting the buyer’s data privacy while also protecting the seller’s application intellectual property through isolated network access controls and subscription authorization.

## Embedded ML models using Amazon SageMaker AI on AWS Marketplace Diagram

![Reference architecture diagram showing how you can use Amazon SageMaker AI on AWS Marketplace.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/embedded-ml-models-using-sagemaker-on-aws-marketplace/images/embedded-ml-models-using-sagemaker-on-aws-marketplace.png)

01. Seller writes and packages their model code as a docker image and pushes the image
     into **Amazon Elastic Container Registry** (Amazon ECR).

02. Seller packages and pushes the image as machine learning (ML) model for listing on
     **AWS Marketplace**.

03. Buyer subscribes to the listing on **AWS Marketplace** using
     **AWS Management Console**.

04. Upon subscription, an **Amazon SageMaker AI** instance is
     provisioned in the buyer VPC in network isolation mode along with the model container
     image and the invocation endpoint.

05. Buyer runs the CFN template that deploys the **AWS Lambda** functions from the zip file located in the **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3) repository.

06. Buyer application invokes a **Lambda** initialization
     endpoint to validate their subscription from the seller.

07. **Lambda** authorizer invokes the **Lambda** function running in the seller’s VPC to return authorization token
     valid for a certain duration.

08. Buyer application invokes a **Lambda** /request endpoint
     along with an authorization token and the data to be processed.

09. **Lambda** authorizer validates the authorization token
     and forwards the call to the **Lambda** proxy.

10. **Lambda** proxy calls the **SageMaker AI** endpoint running in network isolation mode along with the data to be
     processed.

11. **SageMaker AI** endpoint returns the response back to the
     **Lambda** function along with the processed data.

12. **Lambda** stores the response in the **Amazon S3** bucket for the buyer application to use.
