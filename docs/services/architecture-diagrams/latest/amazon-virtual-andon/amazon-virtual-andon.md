1. An **Amazon CloudFront** web interface deploys into an **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3) bucket configured for web hosting.

1. An **Amazon Cognito** user pool allows the solution’s administrators to register users and groups using the web interface.

1. **AWS AppSync** GraphQL APIs and **AWS Amplify** power the web interface. **Amazon DynamoDB** tables store the factory data.

1. An **AWS IoT** rule engine helps users monitor manufacturing workstations or devices for events, and then routes the events to the correct engineer for resolution in real-time.

1. Authorized users can interact with and receive notifications from this solution. An **AWS Lambda** function and **Amazon Simple Notification Service** (Amazon SNS) send email messages and SMS notifications.

1. Issues created, acknowledged, and closed in the web interface are recorded and updated using **AWS AppSync** and **DynamoDB**.

1. The **AWS AppSync** GraphQL APIs can be called directly with HTTP POST requests.
