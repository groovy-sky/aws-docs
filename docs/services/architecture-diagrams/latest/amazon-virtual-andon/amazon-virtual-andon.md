# Amazon Virtual Andon

Publication date: **October 15, 2021 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This architecture provides a scalable Andon system to help optimize processes, support the transition to predictive maintenance, and prevent future equipment issues. This architecture can also be [deployed on AWS](../../../solutions/latest/amazon-virtual-andon/welcome.md) using an CloudFormation template that launches, configures, and runs the AWS services required to deploy this solution using AWS best practices for security and availability.

1. An **Amazon CloudFront** web interface deploys into an **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3) bucket configured for web hosting.

2. An **Amazon Cognito** user pool allows the solution’s
    administrators to register users and groups using the web interface.

3. **AWS AppSync** GraphQL APIs and **AWS Amplify** power the web interface. **Amazon DynamoDB** tables store the factory data.

4. An **AWS IoT** rule engine helps users monitor
    manufacturing workstations or devices for events, and then routes the events to the
    correct engineer for resolution in real-time.

5. Authorized users can interact with and receive notifications from this solution. An
    **AWS Lambda** function and **Amazon Simple Notification Service** (Amazon SNS) send email messages and SMS notifications.

6. Issues created, acknowledged, and closed in the web interface are recorded and updated
    using **AWS AppSync** and **DynamoDB**.

7. The **AWS AppSync** GraphQL APIs can be called directly with
    HTTP POST requests.
