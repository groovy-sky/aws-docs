Publication date: **May 3, 2023 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This reference architecture details two scenarios for how to run serverless, containerized web applications without the need to provision or manage infrastructure.

## Serverless Web Hosting on AWS App Runner

**Developer experience:** Use **AWS App Runner** to create and manage web services based on two types of service sources: source code and source image.

1. **Scenario 1 using a source code:**

a. Commit code to GitHub source repo.

b. Authorize access to source code in GitHub using **AWS CodeStar**.

c. Provide instructions for building and running the web service and specify a managed runtime environment supported by **AWS App Runner**. **AWS CodeBuild** then auto-packages the code and its dependencies and builds a new container image.

d. The container image is then pushed and stored into an **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)** repository, hosted within the **AWS App Runner**-owned account.

2. **Scenario 2 using a source image:**

a. Alternatively, start with a pre-built image stored in a customer-managed **Amazon ECR** repository, hosted within the customer-owned account.

b. By authorizing access to the container image using an **AWS IAM Identity Center** Role, the image is then pushed and stored into **AWS App Runner**-managed **Amazon ECR** repository.

**App Runner Service creation:**

3. The container image stored in **Amazon ECR** is then pulled for deployment as serverless **AWS Fargate** Tasks inside the **AWS App Runner**-owned **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud**, also know as **AWS App Runner** Service VPC. The **AWS Fargate** Tasks are deployed on an **AWS Fargate** cluster running across multiple Availability Zones for high availability in private subnets, and configured with **AWS Application Auto Scaling**.

4. A secure service URL is created/published after a successful deployment. The Secure Service URL maps to a public-facing **AWS Network Load Balancer** and is assigned a default domain name by **AWS App Runner**. Customers can also associate/map a custom domain name they own, but it must be publicly resolvable and can be registered with **Amazon Route 53** Public Hosted Zone or with any DNS provider.

**AWS App Runner** is a secure, consistent solution for exposing web applications using the public endpoint or service URL.

**Inbound traffic path:**

1. Client initiates a request to the service URL.

2. The service URL is resolved to a public-facing **Network Load Balancer** using **Amazon Route 53**. The **AWS NLB** is automatically provisioned and owned by the **AWS App Runner** service.

3. The request enters the **AWS App Runner**-owned VPC through the **AWS Network Load Balancer** (AWS NLB) and is redirected to a L7 Request Router.

4. The L7 Request Router is routes incoming requests to a particular web service instance or **AWS Fargate** Task.

**Outbound traffic path, Scenario 1** (web service doesn’t require access to downstream dependencies within a customer/private VPC):

5. a. Outbound (or return) traffic is routed to the internet through an **AWS**-managed NAT Gateway and an internet gateway provisioned within the **AWS App Runner**-owned VPC, or default networking mode.

**Outbound Traffic Path, Scenario 2** (web service requires access to downstream dependencies within a customer/private VPC):

b. The outbound traffic is forwarded to the customer/private-owned VPC where the private resources/dependencies are manually provisioned by the end-user/developer. Traffic is forwarded to the destination endpoint per the VPC routing table.

6. Traffic to the internet is routed through a customer-managed NAT Gateway and an internet gateway provisioned within the customer/private-owned VPC, or VPC Egress networking mode.

7. **AWS Identity and Access Management** (AWS IAM), **AWS Key Management Service** (AWS KMS), **AWS Secrets Manager**, and **AWS Systems Manager** Parameter Store ensure role-based access and securely store confidential data. **Amazon CloudWatch** and **AWS X-Ray** maintain observability.
