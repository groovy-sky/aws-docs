**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue in the dynamic cluster storage resizing feature that could cause reader DB instances to restart.

- Fixed a failover issue due to a race condition in `RESET QUERY CACHE` statement.

- Fixed a crash in a nested stored procedure call with query cache.

- Fixed an issue to prevent repeated restart of `mysqld` when
recovering from an incomplete truncation of partitioned or
sub-partitioned tables.

- Fixed an issue that could cause migration from on-prem or
RDS for MySQL to Aurora MySQL to not succeed.

- Fixed a rare race condition where the database can restart during
the scaling of the storage volume.

- Fixed an issue in the lock manager where a race condition can
cause a lock to be shared by two transactions, causing the
database to restart.

- Fixed an issue related to transaction lock memory management with
long-running write transactions resulting in a database restart.

- Fixed a race condition in the lock manager that resulted in a
database restart or failover during transaction rollback.

- Fixed an issue during upgrade from 5.6 to 5.7 when the table had
Fast Online DDL enabled in lab mode in 5.6.

- Fixed multiple issues where the engine might restart during
zero-downtime patching while checking for a quiesced point in
database activity for patching.

- Fixed multiple issues related to repeated restarts due to
interrupted DDL operations, such as `DROP TRIGGER`, `ALTER TABLE`, and
specifically `ALTER TABLE` that modifies the type of partitioning or
number of partitions in a table.

- Updated the default value of `table_open_cache` on 16XL and 24XL
instances to avoid repeated restarts and high CPU utilization on
large instances classes (R4/R5-16XL, R5-12XL, R5-24XL). This
impacted 1.21.x and 1.22.x releases.

- Fixed an issue that caused a binlog replica to stop with an `HA_ERR_KEY_NOT_FOUND` error.

## Integration of MySQL community edition bug fixes

- _Replication_: While a `SHOW BINLOG EVENTS` statement was executing, any parallel transaction was blocked.
The fix ensures that the `SHOW BINLOG EVENTS` process now only acquires a lock for the duration of calculating the file's
end position, therefore parallel transactions are not blocked for long durations. (Bug #76618, Bug #20928790)
