# Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2019-02-07 (version 2.03.4) (Deprecated)

**Version:** 2.03.4

Aurora MySQL 2.03.4 is generally available. Aurora MySQL 2.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.7
and Aurora MySQL 1.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.6.

When creating a new Aurora MySQL DB cluster (including restoring a snapshot), you can choose
compatibility with either MySQL 5.7 or MySQL 5.6.

We don't allow in-place upgrade of Aurora MySQL 1.\* clusters into Aurora MySQL 2.03.4 or restore
to Aurora MySQL 2.03.4 from an Amazon S3 backup. We plan to remove these restrictions in a later Aurora MySQL
2.\* release.

If you have any questions or concerns, AWS Support is available on the community forums and through
[AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support). For more information, see
[Maintaining an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](../aurorauserguide/user-upgradedbinstance-maintenance.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

###### Note

This version is currently not available in the AWS GovCloud (US-West) \[us-gov-west-1\]
and China (Beijing) \[cn-north-1\] regions. There will be a separate announcement once it is made
available.

###### Note

The procedure to upgrade your DB cluster has changed. For more information, see [Upgrading the minor version or patch level of an Aurora MySQL DB cluster](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-updates-patching.md) in the

MySQL 5.6), but these features are currently not supported in Aurora MySQL version 2 (compatible
with MySQL 5.7).

## MySQL 5.7 compatibility

Aurora MySQL 2.03.4 is wire-compatible with MySQL 5.7 and includes features such as JSON support, spatial indexes,
and generated columns. Aurora MySQL uses a native implementation of spatial indexing using z-order curves to deliver
>20x better write performance and >10x better read performance than MySQL 5.7 for spatial datasets.

Aurora MySQL 2.03.4 does not currently support the following MySQL 5.7 features:

- Global transaction identifiers (GTIDs). Aurora MySQL supports GTIDs in version 2.04 and higher.

- Group replication plugin

- Increased page size

- InnoDB buffer pool loading at startup

- InnoDB full-text parser plugin

- Multisource replication

- Online buffer pool resizing

- Password validation plugin

- Query rewrite plugins

- Replication filtering

- The `CREATE TABLESPACE` SQL statement

- X Protocol
