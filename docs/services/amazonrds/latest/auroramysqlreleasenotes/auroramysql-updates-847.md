# Aurora MySQL 8.4.7, May 21, 2026

**Version:** 8.4.7

This release of Aurora MySQL is compatible with MySQL 8.4.7. For more information on the community changes that have occurred, see [MySQL 8.4 Release Notes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.4/en).

For details of the new features in Aurora MySQL version 8.4, see [Aurora MySQL version 8.4 compatible with MySQL 8.4](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-mysql84.md). For differences between Aurora MySQL version 8.4, Aurora MySQL version 3, see [Comparison of Aurora MySQL version 3 and Aurora MySQL version 8.4](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-compare-v3-v84.md). For a comparison of Aurora MySQL version 8.4 and MySQL 8.4 Community Edition, see [Comparison of Aurora MySQL version 8.4 and MySQL 8.4 Community Edition](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-compare-v84-community.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

You can perform an in-place major version upgrade, restore a snapshot with upgrade, or initiate a managed blue/green upgrade using [Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments](../aurorauserguide/blue-green-deployments-overview.md) from any currently supported Aurora MySQL version 3 cluster into an Aurora MySQL version 8.4.7 cluster.

For information on planning an upgrade to Aurora MySQL version 8.4, see [Planning a major version upgrade for an Aurora MySQL cluster](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-updates-majorversionupgrade.md#AuroraMySQL.Upgrading.Planning). For general information about Aurora MySQL upgrades, see [Upgrading Amazon Aurora MySQL DB clusters](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-updates-upgrading.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting for Aurora MySQL in-place upgrade](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-updates-majorversionupgrade.md#AuroraMySQL.Upgrading.Troubleshooting) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

If you have any questions or concerns, AWS Support is available on the community forums and through [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support). For more information, see [Maintaining an Aurora DB cluster](../aurorauserguide/user-upgradedbinstance-maintenance.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## New features

- Added support for password management capabilities in Aurora MySQL 8.4, configurable using the cluster parameter group settings. For a full description of MySQL password management capabilities and configuration options, refer to the [MySQL 8.4 Reference Manual, Section 8.2.15 – Password Management](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/password-management.html).

- Added support for the `validate_password` component for enforcing password strength policies, enabled via the `aurora_enable_validate_password_component` parameter and configured through the cluster parameter group.

- Introduced automatic memory management for Aurora MySQL 8.4 with the new `aurora_enable_memory_management` parameter. When set to `ON` (the default), Aurora automatically manages memory recovery actions to prevent out-of-memory (OOM) database restarts, and the `aurora_oom_response` parameter is ignored. Set `aurora_enable_memory_management` to `OFF` to manually control recovery actions through `aurora_oom_response`. For more information, see [Amazon Aurora MySQL out-of-memory issues](../aurorauserguide/auroramysqloom.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## Improvements

Below are the improvements made compared to Aurora MySQL 3.12.0, see [Aurora MySQL 3.12.0 Release Notes](auroramysql-updates-3120.md).

**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue that can cause the writer instance to repeatedly restart when the writer instance restarts while purging an undo record for a table with indexes on virtual columns.

- Fixed an issue that could cause new database cluster creation to fail, requiring the cluster to be deleted and recreated.

- Fixed an issue where the database writer instance could restart unexpectedly during a global database switchover operation while cleaning up temporary tables after SQL statement processing. This restart could result in longer switchover completion time.

- Improved the performance of Aurora physical replication by applying changes from the writer instance on reader instances using multiple threads.

- Fixed an issue which could cause read replicas to restart when the writer instance commits a large transaction with binlog enabled. This issue could also cause errors when reading the binlog file containing the large transaction.

- Fixed an issue where a delay in InnoDB buffer pool resizing during Aurora Serverless v2 scaling operations could cause the database instance to become unresponsive and restart.

- Fixed an issue in the out-of-memory (OOM) avoidance mechanism that could cause a database instance restart while attempting to recover memory under critical memory pressure.

- Fixed an issue where a reader instance could restart repeatedly after being restarted while the writer instance was performing a forceful purge of undo logs.

- Fixed an issue which can cause an unexpected database restart on reader instances when subqueries using Parallel Query requests were not correctly closed on completion.

**General improvements:**

- Fixed commit ordering on binlog replicas with Enhanced Binlog enabled to correctly honor the `replica_preserve_commit_order` setting. This ordering behavior did not affect data integrity or cause conflicts between transactions, as it applied only to the sequencing of non-dependent transactions.

- Fixed an issue which can cause query results to be returned in ascending order instead of the requested descending order when using `ORDER BY DESC` with a range comparison and `LIMIT`.

- Fixed an issue where the reader reports "ERROR 1146" (table not found) during certain online DDL operations on the writer when using INPLACE algorithm. This can occur when either: 1) the reader has not previously opened the table before the DDL begins or 2) the reader restarts or a new reader is created while the DDL is in progress.

- Fixed an issue that can cause replication errors when processing binlog events larger than `aurora_in_memory_relaylog` fixed cache size (128MB).

- Fixed an infrequent issue that could cause the database instance to restart when ongoing SQL statements read from temporary tables during buffer pool resize or page eviction operations.

- Fixed performance issue where optimizer picks sub optimal query execution plan with Prepared Statements using IN and parameterized values.

- Fixed a cluster availability issue that could occur during database server upgrades when DML operations on system tables referenced stale auto-increment values.

- Fixed an issue that can cause queries using hash joins to return incorrect results when parallel query is enabled and the memory required for a hash join exceeds limit.

- Fixed an issue which can, in some cases, cause delayed instance availability during zero-downtime patching or zero-downtime restart operations.

- Fixed issue which could cause engine restart when a spatial GIS query uses a Z-order spatial index on a column declared with an explicit SRID annotation.
