(Bug #27214153, Bug #26864199)

## Comparison with Aurora MySQL version 1

The following Amazon Aurora MySQL features are supported in Aurora MySQL Version 1 (compatible with
MySQL 5.6), but these features are currently not supported in Aurora MySQL Version 2 (compatible
with MySQL 5.7).

- Asynchronous key prefetch (AKP). For more
information, see [Optimizing Aurora indexed join queries with asynchronous key prefetch](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.AKP) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Hash joins. For more information, see [Optimizing large Aurora MySQL join queries with hash joins](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.HashJoin) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Native functions for synchronously invoking AWS Lambda functions. For more
information, see [Invoking a Lambda function with an Aurora MySQL native function](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-integrating-lambda.md#AuroraMySQL.Integrating.NativeLambda) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Scan batching. For more information, see [Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2017-12-11 (version 1.16) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-20171211.md).

- Migrating data from MySQL using an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Migrating data from MySQL by using an Amazon S3 bucket](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-migrating-extmysql.md#AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.S3) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## MySQL 5.7 compatibility

This Aurora MySQL version is wire-compatible with MySQL 5.7 and includes features such as JSON support, spatial indexes,
and generated columns. Aurora MySQL uses a native implementation of spatial indexing using z-order curves to deliver
>20x better write performance and >10x better read performance than MySQL 5.7 for spatial datasets.

This Aurora MySQL version does not currently support the following MySQL 5.7 features:

- Group replication plugin

- Increased page size

- InnoDB buffer pool loading at startup

- InnoDB full-text parser plugin

- Multisource replication

- Online buffer pool resizing

- Password validation plugin

- Query rewrite plugins

- Replication filtering

- The `CREATE TABLESPACE` SQL statement
