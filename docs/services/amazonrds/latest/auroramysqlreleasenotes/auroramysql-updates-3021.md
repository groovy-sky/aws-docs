## Improvements

Aurora MySQL version 3.02.1 is generally available and generally compatible with community MySQL 8.0.23.

**Fixed security issues and CVEs listed below:**

Fixes and other enhancements to fine-tune handling in a managed environment. Additional CVE fixes below:

- [CVE-2022-0778](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-0778)

**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue which can cause connection failure and high latency when multiple MySQL binary log (binlog) replicas are attached to an Aurora
writer node or when there are a large number of concurrent long running queries in conjunction with a surge in new connection requests.

- Fixed an issue that causes a database restart when advanced auditing for `CONNECT` events are turned on.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a database restart on Aurora MySQL read replica instances when internal temporary tables
exhaust the allocated size in memory and mmap files set as a customer-configured or default value.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a read replica to repeatedly restart during concurrent DDL operations on stored procedures.

- Fast insert isn't enabled in this Aurora MySQL version, due to an issue that can cause inconsistencies when running
queries such as `INSERT INTO`, `SELECT`, and `FROM`. For more information on the fast
insert optimization, see [Amazon Aurora MySQL performance enhancements](../aurorauserguide/aurora-auroramysql-overview.md#Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Performance).

**General improvements:**

- Added support for R6i instances.

**Additional Information:**

- Aurora MySQL version 3.02.1 does not contain support for major version upgrades directly from Aurora MySQL version 2 (compatible
with MySQL 5.7). To perform a major version upgrade to this version, first perform a major version upgrade to Aurora MySQL
version 3.02.0, then perform an in-place minor version upgrade to Aurora MySQL version 3.02.1.
