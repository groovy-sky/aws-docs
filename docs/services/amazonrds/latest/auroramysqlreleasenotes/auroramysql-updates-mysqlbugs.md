page was relocated during page traversal, causing an assertion failure (Bug #33715694)

[Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2023-03-01 (version 3.03.0) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-3030.md)

[8.0.26](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-26.html)

3.03.0

- Fixed an issue where sorts of some column types, including JSON and TEXT, sometimes exhausted the sort buffer if its size was not at least 15 times that of the largest row in the sort. Now the sort buffer need only be 15 times as large as the largest sort key. (Bug #103325, Bug #105532, Bug #32738705, Bug #33501541)

- Fixed an issue wherein InnoDB did not always handle some legal names for table partitions correctly. (Bug #32208630)

- Fixed an issue which, in certain conditions, may return incorrect results due to an inaccurate calculation of the nullability property when executing a query with an OR condition. (Bug #34060289)

- Fixed an issue which, in certain conditions, may return incorrect results when the following two conditions are met:

- a derived table is merged into the outer query block.

- the query includes a left join and an IN subquery.

(Bug #34060289)

- Fixed an issue where incorrect AUTO\_INCREMENT values were generated when the maximum integer column value was exceeded. The error was due to the maximum column value not being considered. The previous valid AUTO\_INCREMENT value should have been returned in this case, causing a duplicate key error. (Bug #87926, Bug #26906787)

- Fixed an issue where it was not possible to revoke the DROP privilege on the Performance Schema. (Bug #33578113)

- Fixed an issue where a stored procedure containing an IF statement using EXISTS, which acted on one or more tables that were deleted and recreated between executions, did not execute correctly for subsequent invocations following the first one. (Bug #32855634).

- Fixed an issue where a query that references a view in a subquery and an outer query block can cause an unexpected restart (Bug#32324234)

[Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2022-11-18 (version 3.02.2) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-3022.md)

[8.0.23](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-23.html)

3.02.2

- Fixed an issue which, in certain conditions, may return incorrect results due to an inaccurate calculation of the nullability property when executing a query with an OR condition. (Bug #34060289)

- Fixed an issue which, in certain conditions, may return incorrect results when the following two conditions are met:

- A derived table is merged into the outer query block.

- The query includes a left join and an IN subquery. (Bug #34060289)

- Fixed an issue where it wasn't possible to revoke the DROP privilege on the Performance Schema. (Bug #33578113)

- Fixed an issue where a stored procedure containing an IF statement using EXISTS, which acted on one or more tables
that were deleted and recreated between executions, did not execute correctly for subsequent invocations following the first one. (MySQL Bug #32855634).

- Incorrect AUTO\_INCREMENT values were generated when the maximum integer column value was exceeded. The error was due to the maximum column value not being considered.
The previous valid AUTO\_INCREMENT value should have been returned in this case, causing a duplicate key error. (Bug #87926, Bug #26906787)

- Fixed an issue which can lead to a failure while upgrading an Aurora MySQL version 1 (Compatible with MySQL 5.6) database cluster containing user-created
table with certain table IDs. Assignment of these table IDs may result in conflicting data dictionary table IDs while upgrading from Aurora MySQL version 2
(Compatible with MySQL 5.7) to Aurora MySQL version 3 (Compatible with MySQL 8.0). (Bug #33919635)

## MySQL bugs fixed by Aurora MySQL 2.x database engine updates

MySQL 5.7-compatible version Aurora contains all MySQL bug fixes through MySQL 5.7.44. The
following table identifies additional MySQL bugs that have been fixed by Aurora MySQL database
engine updates, and which update they were fixed in.

Database engine updateVersionMySQL bugs fixed[Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2024-07-09 (version 2.12.3, compatible with MySQL 5.7.44) - RDS Extended Support version](auroramysql-updates-2123.md)

2.12.3

- Fixed an issue where temporary tables bound to triggers while running statements could cause an unexpected DB engine restart.

- Fixed a defect that can cause the server to exit when single-table `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements using indexed expressions
are run as prepared statements. ( [Bug #29257254](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-17.html))

[Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2023-12-28 (version 2.12.1, compatible with MySQL 5.7.40) - RDS Extended Support version](auroramysql-updates-2121.md)

2.12.1

- Fixed an issue which can cause existing and new remote connections to stall when run concurrently with the `SHOW PROCESSLIST` statement (Community Bug #34857411)

- Replication: Some binary log events were not always handled correctly (Bug #34617506)

- Fixed processing of single character tokens by a Full-Text Search (FTS) parser plugin (Bug #35432973)

[Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2023-07-25 (version 2.12.0, compatible with MySQL 5.7.40) - RDS Extended Support version](auroramysql-updates-2120.md)

2.12.0

- Fixed an issue which can cause higher CPU utilization due to background TLS certificate rotation. (Community Bug Fix #34284186)

[Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2023-10-17 (version 2.11.4, compatible with MySQL 5.7.12) - RDS Extended Support version](auroramysql-updates-2114.md)

2.11.4

- Replication: Some binary log events were not always handled correctly. (Bug #34617506)

- Fixed an issue which can cause higher CPU utilization due to background TLS certificate rotation. (Community Bug Fix #34284186)

- In prepared statements, some types of subqueries could cause a server exit. (Bug #33100586)

[Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2022-10-25 (version 2.11.0, compatible with MySQL 5.7.12) - RDS Extended Support version](auroramysql-updates-2110.md)

2.11.0

- Fixed an issue where the code for reading character set information from Performance Schema statement events tables (for example, events\_statements\_current)
did not prevent simultaneous writing to that character set information. As a result, the SQL query text character set could be invalid, which could result in a
server exit. With this fix, an invalid character set causes SQL\_TEXT column truncation and prevents server exits. (Bug #23540008)

- InnoDB: Backport of fix for Community Bug #25189192, Bug #84038. Fixed an issue where after a RENAME TABLE operation that moved a table to a different schema,
InnoDB failed to update INNODB\_SYS\_DATAFILES data dictionary table. This resulted in an error on restart indicating that it could not locate the tablespace data file.

- InnoDB: Fixed an issue where the server dropped an internally defined foreign key index when adding a new index and attempted to use a secondary index defined on a
virtual generated column as the foreign key index, causing a server exit. InnoDB now permits a foreign key constraint to reference a secondary index defined on a
virtual generated column. (Bug #23533396)

- Fixed an issue where two sessions concurrently executing an INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE operation generated a deadlock. During partial rollback of a tuple,
another session could update it. The fix for this bug reverts the fixes for Bug #11758237, Bug #17604730, and Bug #20040791. (Bug #25966845)

- Fixed an issue where the EXECUTE and ALTER ROUTINE privileges weren't correctly granted to routine creators even with automatic\_sp\_privileges enabled. (Bug #27407480)

- Backport of fix for Community Bug#24671968: Fixed an issue where a query could produce incorrect results if the WHERE clause contained a dependent subquery, the table had a secondary index on the
columns in the select list followed by the columns in the subquery, and `GROUP BY` or `DISTINCT` permitted the query to use a Loose Index Scan.

- Fixed an issue where replication breaks if a multi-table delete statement is issued against multiple tables with foreign keys. (Bug #80821)

- Fixed an issue where in special cases certain slave errors are not ignored even with [slave\_skip\_errors](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-replica.html)
enabled. In cases when opening and locking a table failed or when field conversions failed on a server running row-based replication, the error is considered critical and the state of
[slave\_skip\_errors](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-replica.html) is ignored. The fix ensures that with
[slave\_skip\_errors](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-replica.html)) enabled, all errors reported during applying a transaction are correctly handled.
(Bug #70640, Bug #17653275)

- Fixed an issue where a [`SET PASSWORD`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/set-password.html) statement was replicated from a MySQL 5.6 master to a MySQL 5.7 slave, or from a MySQL 5.7 master with the
[log\_builtin\_as\_identified\_by\_password](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-binary-log.html) system variable set to ON to a
MySQL 5.7 slave, the password hash was itself also hashed before being stored on the slave. The issue has now been fixed and the replicated password hash is stored as originally passed to the slave. (Bug#24687073)

- Fixed an issue where serialization of a JSON value consisting of a large sub-document wrapped in many levels of JSON arrays, objects, or both, sometimes required an excessive amount time to complete. (Bug #23031146)

- Statements that cannot be parsed (due, for example, to syntax errors) are no longer written to the slow query log. (Bug #33732907)

[Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2022-11-01 (version 2.10.3) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-2103.md)

2.10.3

- Fixed an issue where the code for reading character set information from Performance Schema statement events tables (for example, events\_statements\_current)
did not prevent simultaneous writing to that character set information. As a result, the SQL query text character set could be invalid, which could result in a
server exit. With this fix, an invalid character set causes SQL\_TEXT column truncation and prevents server exits. (Bug #23540008)

- Fixed an issue when an UPDATE required a temporary table having a primary key larger than 1024 bytes and that table was created using InnoDB, the server could exit. (Bug #25153670

[Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2022-01-26 (version 2.10.2) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-2102.md)

2.10.2

- Fixed an issue in InnoDB where an error in code related to table statistics raised an
assertion in the dict0stats.cc (http://dict0stats.cc/) source file. (Bug #24585978)

- A secondary index over a virtual column became corrupted when the index was built online.
For UPDATE (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/update.html) statements, we fix this
as follows: If the virtual column value of the index record is set to NULL, then we generate this value from the cluster index record. (Bug #30556595)

- ASSERTION "!OTHER\_LOCK" IN LOCK\_REC\_ADD\_TO\_QUEUE (Bug #29195848)

- HANDLE\_FATAL\_SIGNAL (SIG=11) IN \_\_STRCHR\_SSE2 (Bug #28653104)

- Fixed an issue which a query interruption during a lock wait can cause an error in InnoDB. (Bug #28068293)

- Interleaved transactions could sometimes deadlock the replica applier when the transaction isolation level was set to REPEATABLE READ. (Bug #25040331)

- Fixed an issue which can cause binlog replicas to stall due to lock wait timeout.(Bug #27189701)

[Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2021-10-21 (version 2.10.1) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-2101.md)

2.10.1

CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP PRODUCES ZEROS IN TRIGGER. (Bug #25209512)

[Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2021-05-25 (version 2.10.0) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-2100.md)

2.10.0

- Interleaved transactions could sometimes deadlock the replica applier when the transaction isolation level
was set to
[REPEATABLE\
READ](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html). (Bug #25040331)

- When a stored procedure contained a statement referring to a view which in turn referred to another view,
the procedure could not be invoked successfully more than once. (Bug #87858, Bug #26864199)

- For queries with many `OR` conditions, the optimizer now is more memory-efficient and less
likely to exceed the memory limit imposed by the
[range\_optimizer\_max\_mem\_size](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html)
system variable. In addition, the default value for that variable has been raised from 1,536,000 to
8,388,608. (Bug #79450, Bug #22283790)

- _Replication:_ In the `next_event()` function, which is called by a
replica's SQL thread to read the next event from the relay log, the SQL thread did not release the
`relaylog.log_lock` it acquired when it ran into an error (for example, due to a closed relay
log), causing all other threads waiting to acquire a lock on the relay log to hang. With this fix, the
lock is released before the SQL thread leaves the function under the situation. (Bug #21697821)

- Fixing a memory corruption for `ALTER TABLE` with virtual column. (Bug #24961167; Bug
#24960450)

- _Replication:_ Multithreaded replicas could not be configured with small queue sizes
using
[slave\_pending\_jobs\_size\_max](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-replica.html)
if they ever needed to process transactions larger than that size. Any packet larger than
[slave\_pending\_jobs\_size\_max](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-replica.html)
was rejected with the error `ER_MTS_EVENT_BIGGER_PENDING_JOBS_SIZE_MAX`, even if the packet was
smaller than the limit set by
[slave\_max\_allowed\_packet](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-replica.html).
With this fix,
[slave\_pending\_jobs\_size\_max](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-replica.html)
becomes a soft limit rather than a hard limit. If the size of a packet exceeds
[slave\_pending\_jobs\_size\_max](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-replica.html)
but is less than
[slave\_max\_allowed\_packet](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-replica.html),
the transaction is held until all the replica workers have empty queues, and then processed. All
subsequent transactions are held until the large transaction has been completed. The queue size for
replica workers can therefore be limited while still allowing occasional larger transactions. (Bug
#21280753, Bug #77406)

- _Replication:_ When using a multithreaded replica, applier errors displayed worker ID
data that was inconsistent with data externalized in Performance Schema replication tables. (Bug
#25231367)

- _Replication:_ On a GTID-based replication replica running with
[-gtid-mode=ON](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-gtids.html),
[-log-bin=OFF](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-binary-log.html),
and using
[-slave-skip-errors](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-replica.html),
when an error was encountered that should be ignored `Exec_Master_Log_Pos` was not being
correctly updated, causing `Exec_Master_Log_Pos` to loose synchrony with
`Read_master_log_pos`. If a `GTID_NEXT` was not specified, the replica would never
update its GTID state when rolling back from a single statement transaction. The
`Exec_Master_Log_Pos` would not be updated because even though the transaction was finished,
its GTID state would show otherwise. The fix removes the restraint of updating the GTID state when a
transaction is rolled back only if `GTID_NEXT` is specified. (Bug #22268777)

- _Replication:_ A partially failed statement was not correctly consuming an
auto-generated or specified GTID when binary logging was disabled. The fix ensures that a partially failed
[DROP TABLE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/drop-table.html), a partially
failed [DROP USER](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/drop-user.html), or a
partially failed [DROP VIEW](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/drop-view.html) consume respectively
the relevant GTID and save it into `@@GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED` and
`mysql.gtid_executed` table when binary logging is disabled. (Bug #21686749)

- _Replication:_ Replicas running MySQL 5.7 could not connect to a MySQL 5.5 source due
to an error retrieving the
[server\_uuid](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options.html),
which is not part of MySQL 5.5. This was caused by changes in the method of retrieving the
`server_uuid`. (Bug #22748612)

- Binlog replication: GTID transaction skipping mechanism was not working properly for XA transaction before
this fix. Server has a mechanism to skip (silently) a GTID transaction if it is already executed that
particular transaction in the past. (BUG#25041920)

- [XA ROLLBACK](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/xa-statements.html) statements that failed
because an incorrect transaction ID was given, could be recorded in the binary log with the correct
transaction ID, and could therefore be actioned by replication replicas. A check is now made for the error
situation before binary logging takes place, and failed XA `ROLLBACK` statements are not
logged. (Bug #26618925)

- _Replication:_ If a replica was set up using a
[CHANGE MASTER TO](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/change-master-to.html)
statement that did not specify the source log file name and source log position, then shut down before
[START SLAVE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/start-slave.html) was issued, then
restarted with the option
[-relay-log-recovery](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-replica.html)
set, replication did not start. This happened because the receiver thread had not been started before
relay log recovery was attempted, so no log rotation event was available in the relay log to provide the
source log file name and source log position. In this situation, the replica now skips relay log recovery
and logs a warning, then proceeds to start replication. (Bug #28996606, Bug #93397)

- _Replication:_ In row-based replication, a message that incorrectly displayed field
lengths was returned when replicating from a table with a `utf8mb3` column to a table of the
same definition where the column was defined with a `utf8mb4` character set. (Bug #25135304,
Bug #83918)

- _Replication:_ When a
[RESET SLAVE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/reset-slave.html) statement was
issued on a replication replica with GTIDs in use, the existing relay log files were purged, but the
replacement new relay log file was generated before the set of received GTIDs for the channel had been
cleared. The former GTID set was therefore written to the new relay log file as the
`PREVIOUS_GTIDS` event, causing a fatal error in replication stating that the replica had more
GTIDs than the source, even though the gtid\_executed set for both servers was empty. Now, when `RESET
                            SLAVE` is issued, the set of received GTIDs is cleared before the new relay log file is generated,
so that this situation does not occur. (Bug #27411175)

- _Replication:_ With GTIDs in use for replication, transactions including statements
that caused a parsing error
( [ER\_PARSE\_ERROR](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html))
could not be skipped manually by the recommended method of injecting an empty or replacement transaction
with the same GTID. This action should result in the replica identifying the GTID as already used, and
therefore skipping the unwanted transaction that shared its GTID. However, in the case of a parsing error,
because the statement was parsed before the GTID was checked to see if it needed to be skipped, the
replication applier thread stopped due to the parsing error, even though the intention was for the
transaction to be skipped anyway. With this fix, the replication applier thread now ignores parsing errors
if the transaction concerned needs to be skipped because the GTID was already used. Note that this
behavior change does not apply in the case of workloads consisting of binary log output produced by
`mysqlbinlog`. In that situation, there would be a risk that a transaction with a parsing error
that immediately follows a skipped transaction would also be silently skipped, when it ought to raise an
error. (Bug #27638268)

- _Replication:_ Enable the SQL thread to GTID skip a partial transaction. (Bug
#25800025)

- _Replication:_ When a negative or fractional timeout parameter was supplied to
`WAIT_UNTIL_SQL_THREAD_AFTER_GTIDS()`, the server behaved in unexpected ways. With this fix:

- A fractional timeout value is read as-is, with no round-off.

- A negative timeout value is rejected with an error if the server is on a strict SQL mode; if the
server is not on a strict SQL mode, the value makes the function return `NULL` immediately
without any waiting and then issue a warning. (Bug #24976304, Bug #83537)

- _Replication_: If the `WAIT_FOR_EXECUTED_GTID_SET()` function was used with
a timeout value including a fractional part (for example, 1.5), an error in the casting logic meant that
the timeout was rounded down to the nearest whole second, and to zero for values less than 1 second (for
example, 0.1). The casting logic has now been corrected so that the timeout value is applied as originally
specified with no rounding. Thanks to Dirkjan Bussink for the contribution. (Bug #29324564, Bug #94247)

- With GTIDs enabled, [XA COMMIT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/xa-statements.html) on a
disconnected XA transaction within a multiple-statement transaction raised an assertion. (Bug #22173903)

- _Replication:_ An assertion was raised in debug builds if an
[XA ROLLBACK](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/xa-statements.html) statement was issued for
an unknown transaction identifier when the
[gtid\_next](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-gtids.html)
value had been set manually. The server now does not attempt to update the GTID state if an XA
`ROLLBACK` statement fails with an error. (Bug #27928837, Bug #90640)

- Fix wrong sorting order issue when multiple `CASE` functions are used in `ORDER BY`
clause. (Bug#22810883)

- Some queries that used ordering could access an uninitialized column during optimization and cause a server exit. (Bug #27389294)

[Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2020-11-10 (version 2.07.3) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-2073.md)

2.07.3

- _InnoDB:_ Concurrent XA transactions that ran
successfully to the XA prepare stage on the master conflicted when
replayed on the slave, resulting in a lock wait timeout in the
applier thread. The conflict was due to the GAP lock range which
differed when the transactions were replayed serially on the
slave. To prevent this type of conflict, GAP locks taken by XA
transactions in [READ COMMITTED](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html)
isolation level are now released (and no longer inherited) when XA
transactions reach the prepare stage. (Bug #27189701, Bug
#25866046)

- _InnoDB:_ A gap lock was taken unnecessarily
during foreign key validation while using the [READ COMMITTED](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html)
isolation level. (Bug #25082593)

- _Replication:_ When using XA transactions, if a
lock wait timeout or deadlock occurred for the applier (SQL)
thread on a replication slave, the automatic retry did not work.
The cause was that while the SQL thread would do a rollback, it
would not roll the XA transaction back. This meant that when the
transaction was retried, the first event was XA START which was
invalid as the XA transaction was already in progress, leading to
an XAER\_RMFAIL error. (Bug #24764800)

- _Replication:_ Interleaved transactions could
sometimes deadlock the slave applier when the transaction
isolation level was set to [REPEATABLE READ](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html).
(Bug #25040331)

- _Replication:_ The value returned by a
[SHOW SLAVE STATUS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/show-slave-status.html)
statement for the total combined size of all existing relay log
files (Relay\_Log\_Space) could become much larger than the actual
disk space used by the relay log files. The I/O thread did not
lock the variable while it updated the value, so the SQL thread
could automatically delete a relay log file and write a reduced
value before the I/O thread finished updating the value. The I/O
thread then wrote its original size calculation, ignoring the SQL
thread's update and so adding back the space for the deleted file.
The Relay\_Log\_Space value is now locked during updates to prevent
concurrent updates and ensure an accurate calculation. (Bug
#26997096, Bug #87832)

- For an [INSERT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert.html)

table had a `BEFORE INSERT` trigger. (Bug #25209512, Bug #84077)

- A server exit could result from simultaneous attempts by multiple

- Executing a stored procedure containing a query that accessed a

- Bug #26654685: A corrupt index ID encountered during a foreign key
check raised an assertion

- Bug #15831300: By default, when promoting integers from a smaller
type on the master to a larger type on the slave (for example,
from a [SMALLINT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/integer-types.html)
column on the master to a [BIGINT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/integer-types.html)
column on the slave), the promoted values are treated as though
they are signed. Now in such cases it is possible to modify or
override this behavior using one or both of `ALL_SIGNED`,
`ALL_UNSIGNED` in the set of values specified for the
[slave\_type\_conversions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/replication-options-replica.html)
server system variable. For more information, see
[Row-based replication: attribute promotion and demotion](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/replication-features-differing-tables.html),
as well as the description of the variable.

- Bug #17449901: With `foreign_key_checks=0`, InnoDB permitted an
index required by a foreign key constraint to be dropped, placing
the table into an inconsistent and causing the foreign key check
that occurs at table load to fail. InnoDB now prevents dropping an
index required by a foreign key constraint, even with
foreign\_key\_checks=0. The foreign key constraint must be removed
before dropping the foreign key index.
