# Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2018-10-08 (version 2.02.5) (Deprecated)

**Version:** 2.02.5

Aurora MySQL 2.02.5 is generally available. Aurora MySQL 2.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.7
and Aurora MySQL 1.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.6.

When creating a new Aurora MySQL DB cluster, you can choose
compatibility with either MySQL 5.7 or MySQL 5.6. When restoring a MySQL 5.6-compatible snapshot,
you can choose compatibility with either MySQL 5.7 or MySQL 5.6.

You can restore snapshots of Aurora MySQL 1.14.\*, 1.15.\*, 1.16.\*, 1.17.\*, 1.18.\*, 2.01.\*, and 2.02.\* into Aurora MySQL
2.02.5. You can also perform an in-place upgrade from Aurora MySQL 2.01.\* or 2.02.\* to Aurora MySQL 2.02.5.

We don't allow in-place upgrade of Aurora MySQL 1.\* clusters into Aurora MySQL 2.02.5 or restore
to Aurora MySQL 2.02.5 from an Amazon S3 backup. We plan to remove these restrictions in a later Aurora MySQL
2.\* release.

The performance schema is disabled for this release of Aurora MySQL 5.7. Upgrade to Aurora 2.03 for performance schema support.

## MySQL 5.7 compatibility

Aurora MySQL 2.02.5 is wire-compatible with MySQL 5.7 and includes features such as JSON support, spatial indexes,
and generated columns. Aurora MySQL uses a native implementation of spatial indexing using z-order curves to deliver
>20x better write performance and >10x better read performance than MySQL 5.7 for spatial datasets.

Aurora MySQL 2.02.5 does not currently support the following MySQL 5.7 features:

- Global transaction identifiers (GTIDs). Aurora MySQL supports GTIDs in version 2.04 and higher.

- Group replication plugin

- Increased page size

- InnoDB buffer pool loading at startup

- InnoDB full-text parser plugin

- Multisource replication

- Online buffer pool resizing

- Password validation plugin

- Query rewrite plugins

- Replication filtering
