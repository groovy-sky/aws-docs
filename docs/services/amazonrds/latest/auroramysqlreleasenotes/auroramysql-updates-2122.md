## Improvements

**Fixed security issues and CVEs listed below:**

This release includes all community CVE fixes up to and including MySQL 5.7.44. The following CVE fixes are included:

- [CVE-2024-20963](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-CVE-2024-20963)

- [CVE-2023-39975](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-39975)

- [CVE-2023-38545](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38545)

Security issues:

- Added a fix that ensures binary log replicas default to using SSL/TLS if the source supports encrypted connections, irrespective of the `MASTER_SSL` setting.

**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue that can prevent a read replica instance from launching successfully if there is a high workload on the writer instance.

- Fixed an issue which can cause an Aurora MySQL database writer instance to failover due to a defect in the component that communicates with Aurora storage.
The defect occurs as a result of a breakdown in the communication between the database instance and the underlying storage following a software update of the
Aurora storage instance.

- Fixed an issue which, in rare conditions, can cause the reader instances to restart.

- Fixed an issue in which a privileged user can modify the [resource limits](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/user-resources.html)
associated with the user, [rdsadmin](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-security.md).
When set incorrectly, these resource limits can impede the RDS monitoring agent's ability to monitor the health of the database instance leading to database unavailability.

**Upgrades and migrations:**

- Fixed an issue that occurred when attempting to start the binary log replication for Aurora MySQL clusters that had migrated from Amazon RDS MySQL 5.7
and that contained unsupported stored procedures.

- Disabled the database event scheduler during a major version upgrade to Aurora MySQL version 3. This update helps avoid any changes to the database
by the event execution while the major version upgrade is in progress.

## Integration of MySQL Community Edition bug fixes

This release includes all community bug fixes up to and including 5.7.44. For more information, see
