## Improvements

**Security fixes:**

Fixes and other enhancements to fine-tune handling in a managed environment.
Additional CVE fixes below:

- [CVE-2020-14559](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-14559)

- [CVE-2020-14539](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-14539)

**Incompatible changes:**

This version introduces a permission change that affects the behavior of the `mysqldump` command.
Users must have the `PROCESS` privilege to access the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES` table.
To run the `mysqldump` command without any changes, grant the `PROCESS` privilege to the database user
that the `mysqldump` command connects to. You can also run the `mysqldump` command with the
`--no-tablespaces` option. With that option, the `mysqldump ` output doesn't include any
`CREATE LOGFILE GROUP` or `CREATE TABLESPACE` statements. In that case, the `mysqldump`
command doesn't access the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES` table, and you don't need to grant
the `PROCESS` permission.

**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue that causes an Aurora reader instance in a global
database secondary cluster running 1.23.0 to restart repeatedly.

- Fixed an issue where a global database secondary Region's replicas might
restart when upgraded to release 1.23.0 while the primary Region
writer was on an older release version.

- Fixed a memory leak in dynamic resizing feature, introduced in
Aurora MySQL 1.23.0.

- Fixed an issue that might cause server restart during execution of a
query using the parallel query feature.

- Fixed an issue that might cause a client session to hang when the
database engine encounters an error while reading from or writing to
the network.
