# Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2018-10-11 (version 2.03) (Deprecated)

**Version:** 2.03

Aurora MySQL 2.03 is generally available. Aurora MySQL 2.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.7
and Aurora MySQL 1.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.6.

When creating a new Aurora MySQL DB cluster, you can choose
compatibility with either MySQL 5.7 or MySQL 5.6. When restoring a MySQL 5.6-compatible snapshot,
you can choose compatibility with either MySQL 5.7 or MySQL 5.6.

You can restore snapshots of Aurora MySQL 1.14.\*, 1.15.\*, 1.16.\*, 1.17.\*, 1.18.\*, 2.01.\*, and
2.02.\* into Aurora MySQL 2.03.

We don't allow in-place upgrade of Aurora MySQL 1.\* clusters into Aurora MySQL 2.03 or restore
to Aurora MySQL 2.03 from an Amazon S3 backup. We plan to remove these restrictions in a later Aurora MySQL
2.\* release.

###### Note

This version is currently not available in the AWS GovCloud (US-West) \[us-gov-west-1\]
and China (Beijing) \[cn-north-1\] regions. There will be a separate announcement once it is made
available.

If you have any questions or concerns, AWS Support is available on the community forums and through
[AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support). For more information, see

## Improvements

- Performance schema is available.

- Fixed an issue where zombie sessions with killed state might consume more CPU.

- Fixed a dead latch issue when a read-only transaction is acquiring a lock on a record on
the Aurora Writer.

- Fixed an issue where the Aurora Replica without customer workload
might have high CPU utilization.

- Multiple fixes on issues that might cause the Aurora Replica or the
Aurora writer to restart.

- Added capability to skip diagnostic logging when the disk
throughput limit is reached.

- Fixed a memory leak issue when binlog is enabled on the Aurora
Writer.

## Integration of MySQL community edition bug fixes

- REVERSE SCAN ON A PARTITIONED TABLE DOES ICP - ORDER BY DESC (Bug
#24929748).

- JSON\_OBJECT CREATES INVALID JSON CODE (Bug#26867509).

- INSERTING LARGE JSON DATA TAKES AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME (Bug
#22843444).

#25080442).

## Comparison with Aurora MySQL version 1

The following Amazon Aurora MySQL features are supported in Aurora MySQL version 1 (compatible with
MySQL 5.6), but these features are currently not supported in Aurora MySQL version 2 (compatible
with MySQL 5.7).

- Asynchronous key prefetch (AKP). For more
information, see [Optimizing Aurora indexed join queries with asynchronous key prefetch](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.AKP) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Hash joins. For more information, see [Optimizing large Aurora MySQL join queries with hash joins](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.HashJoin) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Native functions for synchronously invoking AWS Lambda functions. For more
information, see [Invoking a Lambda function with an Aurora MySQL native function](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-integrating-lambda.md#AuroraMySQL.Integrating.NativeLambda) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Scan batching. For more information, see [Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2017-12-11 (version 1.16) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-20171211.md).

- Migrating data from MySQL using an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Migrating data from MySQL by using an Amazon S3 bucket](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-migrating-extmysql.md#AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.S3) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## MySQL 5.7 compatibility

Aurora MySQL 2.03 is wire-compatible with MySQL 5.7 and includes features such as JSON support, spatial indexes,
and generated columns. Aurora MySQL uses a native implementation of spatial indexing using z-order curves to deliver
>20x better write performance and >10x better read performance than MySQL 5.7 for spatial datasets.

Aurora MySQL 2.03 does not currently support the following MySQL 5.7 features:

- Global transaction identifiers (GTIDs). Aurora MySQL supports GTIDs in version 2.04 and higher.

- Group replication plugin

- Increased page size

- InnoDB buffer pool loading at startup

- InnoDB full-text parser plugin

- Multisource replication

- Online buffer pool resizing

- Password validation plugin

- Query rewrite plugins

- Replication filtering

- The `CREATE TABLESPACE` SQL statement

- X Protocol
