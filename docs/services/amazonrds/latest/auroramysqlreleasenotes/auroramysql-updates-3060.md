## New features

- Aurora MySQL version 3.06.0 supports Amazon Bedrock integration and introduces the new reserved keywords `accept`, `aws_bedrock_invoke_model`,
`aws_sagemaker_invoke_endpoint`, `content_type`, and `timeout_ms`.
Check the object definitions for the usage of the new reserved keywords before upgrading to version 3.06.0. To mitigate the conflict with the new reserved keywords, quote
the reserved keywords used in the object definitions. For more information on the Amazon Bedrock integration and handling the reserved
keywords, see [What is Amazon Bedrock?](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.
For additional information, see [Keywords and Reserved Words](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/keywords.html),
[The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA KEYWORDS Table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema-keywords-table.html), and
[Schema Object Names](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/identifiers.html) in the MySQL documentation.

- Improved performance for binary log replicas when replicating transactions for large tables with more than one
secondary index. This feature introduces a thread pool to apply secondary index changes in parallel on a binlog replica.
The feature is controlled by the `aurora_binlog_replication_sec_index_parallel_workers` DB cluster parameter,
which controls the total number of parallel threads available to apply the secondary index changes. For more information, see
[Optimizing binary log\
replication](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-replication-mysql.md#binlog-optimization) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Added a new stored procedure `mysql.rds_set_read_only` that allows changing the value of the global system
variable `read_only` on database instances in your Aurora MySQL cluster. For more information, see [Replicating](../aurorauserguide/mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md)
in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Added a new stored procedure `mysql.rds_set_binlog_source_ssl` that allows setting the encryption on a
binary log replica by specifying a value for `SOURCE_SSL`. For more information, see [Replicating](../aurorauserguide/mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md)
in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- [Amazon Aurora Machine Learning](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/machine-learning) is an optimized
integration between the Aurora MySQL database and AWS machine learning (ML) services. [Amazon Bedrock](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.md) is now supported, allowing you to invoke machine
learning models in Amazon Bedrock directly from your Aurora MySQL DB cluster using SQL. For more information on using Amazon Bedrock with your
Aurora MySQL DB cluster, see [Using\
Amazon Aurora machine learning with Aurora MySQL](../aurorauserguide/mysql-ml.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Aurora MySQL version 3.06 adds support for [automated undo\
tablespace truncation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-undo-tablespaces.html). This optimization allows you to reclaim unused space in undo tablespaces after the
undo logs have been purged.

## Improvements

**Fixed security issues and CVEs:**

The following CVE fixes are included in this release:

- [CVE-2020-11104](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11104)

- [CVE-2020-11105](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11105)

- [CVE-2023-38545](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38545)

- [CVE-2023-38546](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38546)

- [CVE-2023-39975](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39975)

**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue where a read replica DB instance can't be launched successfully when there's high workload in the
writer DB instance.

- Fixed an issue where an Aurora MySQL writer DB instance can fail over due to a defect in communication with Aurora
storage. The defect occurs as a result of a breakdown in the communication between the DB instance and underlying
storage following a software update of the Aurora storage instance.

- Fixed an issue when processing `INSERT` queries on InnoDB partitioned tables that can cause a gradual
decline of free memory in the instance.

- Fixed an issue that can cause an Aurora MySQL DB instance to restart or fail over due to a decrease in freeable memory
when hash join is used while running queries.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a database instance restart when running
[SHOW STATUS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-status.html) and
[PURGE BINARY LOGS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/purge-binary-logs.html) statements
concurrently. `PURGE BINARY LOGS` is a managed statement that is run to honor the user-configured binlog
retention period.

- Fixed an issue that can cause the server to unexpectedly close after running Data Manipulation Language (DML)
statements on a table whose nonvirtual columns were reordered with a `MODIFY COLUMN` or `CHANGE
                          COLUMN` statement.

- Fixed an issue that, during the restart of a database instance, can cause an additional restart.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a database restart when a cascading `UPDATE` or `DELETE` foreign
key constraint is defined on a table where a virtual column is involved either as a column in the foreign key
constraint, or as a member of the referenced table.

- In Aurora MySQL 2.10, we added support for rebooting an Aurora DB cluster with read availability. This feature allows
reader DB instances to stay online while a writer DB instance is rebooted. This feature is now supported on secondary
AWS Regions in Aurora MySQL global databases, ensuring that you can still serve read requests during a writer instance
restart on the primary cluster. Previously, when a writer instance restarted, all reader instances in an Aurora MySQL
secondary cluster also restarted. With this release, secondary cluster reader instances continue to serve read requests
during a writer instance restart, improving read availability in the cluster. For more information, see [Rebooting an Aurora cluster with read availability](../aurorauserguide/user-rebootcluster.md#aurora-mysql-survivable-replicas).

- Fixed an issue that can interrupt database recovery during startup if the restart occurred while running heavy insert
operations involving `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns.

**General improvements:**

- Fixed an issue that can cause a parallel query to fail due to transient network issues while reading data from the
Aurora cluster volume.

- Fixed an issue where the user is unable to interrupt any query or set session timeouts for `performance_schema` queries.

- Fixed an issue where binary log (binlog) replication configured to use custom SSL certificates
( [mysql.rds\_import\_binlog\_ssl\_material](../aurorauserguide/mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_import_binlog_ssl_material))
could fail when the replication instance is undergoing a host replacement.

- Small DB instances with less than or equal to 4 GiB of memory now close the
top memory-consuming connections when the DB instance is under memory pressure.
You can also tune the buffer pool to decrease its size. For more information,
see [Amazon Aurora MySQL out-of-memory issues](../aurorauserguide/aurora-mysql-troubleshooting-workload.md#AuroraMySQLOOM) in the _Amazon Aurora User_
_Guide_.

- Changed the default response for `aurora_oom_response`, on all DB instance classes that have more than 4 GiB of memory, from empty
to `print`. For more information, see
[Amazon Aurora MySQL \
out-of-memory issues](../aurorauserguide/aurora-mysql-troubleshooting-workload.md#AuroraMySQLOOM) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Fixed an issue related to audit log file management that can cause log files to be inaccessible for download or
rotation, and in some cases increase CPU usage.

- Optimized `AUTO_INCREMENT` key recovery to reduce the completion time for restoring snapshots, performing
point-in-time recovery, and cloning DB clusters with large numbers of tables in the database.

- Fixed an issue where the [wait/io/redo\_log\_flush](../aurorauserguide/ams-waits-io-auredologflush.md)
event wasn't shown in the Performance Schema
[wait event summary tables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.html).

- Added the `Aurora_lockmgr_memory_used` and `Aurora_lockmgr_buffer_pool_memory_used` metrics to
track the lock manager's memory usage. For more information, see [Aurora MySQL global status variables](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-reference-parametergroups.md#AuroraMySQL.Reference.GlobalStatusVars) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Fixed an issue where small read replica instances can experience increased replication lag after upgrading from
Aurora MySQL versions lower than 2.11.\*.

- Fixed an issue that can cause duplicate key errors for `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns using descending indices
after a snapshot restore, backtrack, or database cloning operation.

- Fixed an issue where a `SELECT` query on an Aurora reader instance might fail with the error
**`table doesn't exist`** when the table has at least one full-text search (FTS) index and a
`TRUNCATE` statement is being run on the Aurora writer DB instance.

- Fixed an issue that can cause an incomplete result set when running queries involving `LEFT JOIN` or
`RIGHT JOIN` operations using the hash join algorithm with parallel query.

**Upgrades and migrations:**

- Fixed an issue that can cause major version upgrades to fail if there is a user-defined `FTS_DOC_ID` column
present in the table schema.

- Fixed an issue that can cause upgrade failures from Aurora MySQLversion 2 to Aurora MySQL version 3 due to a
synchronization issue while processing InnoDB tablespaces.

- Fixed an issue that can cause major version upgrades to Aurora MySQL version 3 to fail due to the presence of orphaned
entries for already deleted tablespaces in InnoDB system tables in Aurora MySQL version 2.

## Integration of MySQL Community Edition bug fixes

This release includes all community bug fixes up to and including 8.0.34, in addition to the following. For more information, see
[MySQL\
bugs fixed by Aurora MySQL 3.x database engine updates](auroramysql-updates-mysqlbugs.md#AuroraMySQL.Updates.MySQLBugs.v3).

- Fixed an issue where cache line value can be calculated incorrectly, causing a failure during database restart on
Graviton-based instances. (Community Bug Fix #35479763)

- Fixed an issue where some instances of subqueries within stored routines were not always handled correctly. (Community
Bug Fix #35377192)

- Fixed an issue that can cause higher CPU usage due to background TLS certificate rotation (Community Bug Fix
#34284186).

- Fixed an issue where InnoDB allowed the addition of `INSTANT` columns to tables in the MySQL system schema
in Aurora MySQL versions lower than 3.05, which could lead to the server unexpectedly closing (database instance
restarting) after upgrading to Aurora MySQL version 3.05.0. (Community Bug Fix #35625510).
