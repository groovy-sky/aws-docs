## Improvements

**Fixed security issues and CVEs:**

The following CVE fixes are included in this release:

- [CVE-2020-11104](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11104)

- [CVE-2020-11105](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11105)

- [CVE-2023-38545](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38545)

- [CVE-2023-39975](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39975)

**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue where processing `INSERT` queries on InnoDB
partitioned tables can cause a gradual decline of free memory in the
instance.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a database instance restart when running [SHOW\
STATUS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-status.html) and [PURGE\
BINARY LOGS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/purge-binary-logs.html) statements concurrently. `PURGE BINARY LOGS`
is a managed statement that is run to honor the user-configured binlog retention
period.

- Fixed an issue that can cause the server to unexpectedly close after running
Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements on a table whose nonvirtual columns
were reordered with a `MODIFY COLUMN` or `CHANGE COLUMN`
statement.

- Fixed an issue that, during the restart of a database instance, can cause an
additional restart.

**General improvements:**

- Fixed an issue where the user is unable to interrupt any query or set session
timeouts for `performance_schema` queries.

- Fixed an issue where binary log (binlog) replication setup using custom SSL
certificates ( [mysql.rds\_import\_binlog\_ssl\_material](../aurorauserguide/mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_import_binlog_ssl_material)) could fail when the
replication instance is undergoing a host replacement.

- Fixed an issue related to audit log file management that can cause log files
to be inaccessible for download or rotation, and in some cases increase CPU
usage.

- In Aurora MySQL versions lower than 3.05.2, users are unable to retrieve the output of `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` on Aurora MySQL
reader DB instances. This is due to the [default InnoDB\
behavior](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-read-only-instance.html) when `innodb_read_only` is enabled.

In Aurora MySQL version 3.05.2 and higher, when `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` is run on a reader instance, the output is written to
the MySQL error log, allowing for easier troubleshooting.

For more information on working with MySQL error logs, see [Aurora MySQL error logs](../aurorauserguide/user-logaccess-mysql-logfilesize.md#USER_LogAccess.MySQL.Errorlog). For more information on `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`, see [SHOW ENGINE statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-engine.html) in the MySQL documentation.

**Upgrades and migrations:**

- Fixed an issue that can cause upgrade failures from Aurora MySQL version 2 to
Aurora MySQL version 3 when there is a user-defined `FTS_DOC_ID` column
present in the table schema.

- Fixed an issue that can cause upgrade failures from Aurora MySQL version 2 to
Aurora MySQL version 3 due to a synchronization issue while processing InnoDB
tablespaces.

- Fixed an issue that can cause major version upgrades to Aurora MySQL version 3
to fail due to the presence of orphaned entries for already deleted tablespaces
in InnoDB system tables in Aurora MySQL version 2.

## Integration of MySQL Community Edition bug fixes

This release includes all community bug fixes up to and including 8.0.32, in addition to the following. For more information, see
[MySQL \
bugs fixed by Aurora MySQL 3.x database engine updates](auroramysql-updates-mysqlbugs.md#AuroraMySQL.Updates.MySQLBugs.v3).

- Fixed an issue where `records_in_range` performed an excessive
number of disk reads for `INSERT` operations, leading to a gradual
decline in performance. (Community Bug Fix #34976138)
