## Improvements

Aurora MySQL version 3.02.2 is generally available and generally compatible with community MySQL 8.0.23.

**Fixed security issues and CVEs listed below:**

Fixes and other enhancements to fine-tune handling in a managed environment. Additional CVE fixes below:

- [CVE-2022-21451](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-21451)

- [CVE-2021-36222](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36222)

- [CVE-2021-22926](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22926)

- [CVE-2022-21444](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-21451)

**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue which can cause the database instance to restart due to incorrectly accessing the invalid memory when a
connection to the database instance is closed explicitly or implicitly.

- Fixed an issue which can cause the database startup to be interrupted repeatedly on larger instance classes due to buffer pool
initialization taking longer than expected.

- Fixed an issue which, in rare conditions, can cause the database instance to restart when Aurora Serverless v2 incorrectly
attempts to update the table cache while scaling.

- Fixed an issue which, in rare conditions, could cause the database to restart when processing a query with a GROUP BY clause
that truncates a decimal column to zero decimal places.

- Fast insert isn't enabled in this Aurora MySQL version, due to an issue that can cause inconsistencies when running
queries such as `INSERT INTO`, `SELECT`, and `FROM`. For more information on the fast
insert optimization, see [Amazon Aurora MySQL performance enhancements](../aurorauserguide/aurora-auroramysql-overview.md#Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Performance).

**General improvements:**

- Fixed an issue that can cause upgrade failures from Aurora MySQL version 2 (compatible with MySQL 5.7) to Aurora MySQL version 3
(compatible with MySQL 8.0) due to a metadata inconsistency in the mysql.host table.

- Added performance improvements to reduce the upgrade time from Aurora MySQL version 2 (compatible with MySQL 5.7) to Aurora MySQL
version 3 (compatible with MySQL 8.0). By parallelizing certain upgrade steps, the time is further shortened when using
larger instance classes, such as db.r6g.16xlarge or db.r5.24xlarge.

- Added support for displaying all errors when upgrading from Aurora MySQL version 2 (compatible with MySQL 5.7) to Aurora MySQL
version 3 (compatible with MySQL 8.0) when previous versions were limited to displaying only 50 errors.

- Fixed an issue, which in rare conditions, can cause the auto-increment counters to be incorrect after a major version upgrade
from Aurora MySQL version 2 (compatible with MySQL 5.7) to Aurora MySQL version 3 (compatible with MySQL 8.0).

- Fixed an issue that can cause major version upgrades from Aurora MySQL version 2 to Aurora MySQL version 3 to fail because
migrating the \`mysql.innodb\_table\_stats\` and \`mysql.innodb\_index\_stats\` tables took longer than expected. This issue
mainly affected database clusters with a large numbers of tables (>1.5 million).

- Fixed an issue that can cause major version upgrades from Aurora MySQL version 2 to Aurora MySQL version 3 to fail due to a defect
in AMS 8.0 engine upgrade workflow, which causes the log records to be accumulated on the Aurora storage cluster volume
and stops normal write operations. This issue mainly affected database clusters with large numbers of tables,
approximately >750k.

- Fixed an issue that prevents Aurora MySQL Serverless v2 idle instances from scaling down to 0.5 ACUs because the MySQL purge
threads were incorrectly kept active.

- Fixed an issue where applications may experience increased latency while connecting to a database instance when the instance
is experiencing a sudden increase in incoming connections.

- Introduced two new Amazon CloudWatch metrics to help troubleshoot connection establishment delays for Aurora MySQL database instances.
More information on AuroraSlowHandshakeCount and AuroraSlowConnectionHandleCount metrics can be found in the [Aurora\
CloudWatch metrics definitions](../aurorauserguide/aurora-auroramysql-monitoring-metrics.md).

## Integration of MySQL Community Edition bug fixes

This release includes all community bug fixes up to and including 8.0.23, in addition to the below. For more information, see
[MySQL bugs fixed by Aurora MySQL 3.x database engine updates](auroramysql-updates-mysqlbugs.md#AuroraMySQL.Updates.MySQLBugs.v3).

- Fixed an issue which, in certain conditions, may return incorrect results due to an inaccurate calculation of the nullability
property when executing a query with an OR condition. (Bug #34060289)

- Fixed an issue which, in certain conditions, may return incorrect results when the following two conditions are met:

- A derived table is merged into the outer query block.

- The query includes a left join and an IN subquery. (Bug #34060289)

- Fixed an issue where it was not possible to revoke the DROP privilege on the Performance Schema. (Bug #33578113)

- Fixed an issue where a stored procedure containing an IF statement using EXISTS, which acted on one or more tables that were
deleted and recreated between executions, did not execute correctly for subsequent invocations following the first one.
(MySQL Bug #32855634).

- Incorrect AUTO\_INCREMENT values were generated when the maximum integer column value was exceeded. The error was due to the
maximum column value not being considered. The previous valid AUTO\_INCREMENT value should have been returned in this
case, causing a duplicate key error. (Bug #87926, Bug #26906787)

- Fixed an issue which can lead to a failure while upgrading an Aurora MySQL version 1 (Compatible with MySQL 5.6) database
cluster containing user-created table with certain table IDs. Assignment of these table IDs may result in conflicting
data dictionary table IDs while upgrading from Aurora MySQL version 2 (Compatible with MySQL 5.7) to Aurora MySQL
version 3 (Compatible with MySQL 8.0) (Bug #33919635)
