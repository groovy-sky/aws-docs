## Improvements

**Fixed security issues and CVEs:**

- Fixed an issue that might cause the audit log to miss events during audit log file rotation.

The following CVE fixes are included in this release:

- [CVE-2023-21963](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21963)

- [CVE-2023-21912](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21912)

- [CVE-2023-0215](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-0215)

- [CVE-2022-43551](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-43551)

- [CVE-2022-37434](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37434)

**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue that can cause database restarts during long transaction recovery.

- Fixed an issue that can cause the database cluster to become unavailable when the writer instance restarts while the database
was creating or dropping triggers on internal system tables.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a database instance to restart while executing a query which references an aggregate
function.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a database restart during the rollback of an `INSERT` statement when parallel query
is enabled.

- Fast insert is enabled only for regular InnoDB tables in Aurora MySQL version 3.03.2 and higher. This optimization doesn’t
work for InnoDB temporary tables. For more information on the fast insert optimization, see
[Amazon Aurora MySQL \
performance enhancements](../aurorauserguide/aurora-auroramysql-overview.md#Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Performance).

**General improvements:**

- Fixed an issue where the reader instance is unable to open a table, with `ERROR 1146`.
This issue occurs when executing certain types of online Data Definition Language (DDL) while the `INPLACE` algorithm is being used on the writer instance.

- Introduced file management performance optimizations on binlog replicas to help reduce contention when writing to relay log files.

- Fixed an issue when parallel query is enabled that causes the query plan optimizer to pick an inefficient execution plan for certain `SELECT` queries that benefit from a primary or secondary index.

- Added logical replication support for the following Data Control Language (DCL) statements: `GRANT/REVOKE` and `CREATE/DROP/ALTER/RENAME USER`.

- Parallel query for Amazon Aurora MySQL is not supported when choosing the Aurora I/O-Optimized cluster configuration. See [Limitations of parallel query for Aurora MySQL](../aurorauserguide/aurora-mysql-parallel-query.md#aurora-mysql-parallel-query-limitations) for more information.

**Upgrades and migrations:**

- To perform a minor version upgrade for an Aurora global database from Aurora MySQL version 3.01 or 3.02 to Aurora MySQL version 3.03 or higher, refer to
[Upgrading Aurora MySQL by modifying the engine version](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-updates-patching.md#AuroraMySQL.Updates.Patching.ModifyEngineVersion).

- Fixed an issue which can cause major version upgrade failures when upgrading to Aurora MySQL version 3 when a trigger definition contains a reserved keyword that is not enclosed in quotation marks.

## Integration of MySQL Community Edition bug fixes

Common Table Expressions (CTEs). (Bug #34572040, Bug #34634469, Bug #33856374)

- InnoDB: A race condition between threads attempting to deinitialize and initialize statistics for the same table raised an assertion failure. (Bug #33135425)
