# Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2023-05-04 (version 2.07.9) (Deprecated)

**Version:** 2.07.9

Aurora MySQL 2.07.9 is generally available. Aurora MySQL 2.07 versions are compatible with MySQL 5.7.12.
For more information on community changes, see [Changes in MySQL 5.7.12 (2016-04-11, General Availability)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/news-5-7-12.html).

Currently supported Aurora MySQL releases are 2.07.\*, 2.11.\*, 3.01.\*, 3.02.\* and 3.03.\*.

You can restore a snapshot from a currently supported Aurora MySQL release into Aurora MySQL 2.07.9. You also have the option to upgrade
existing Aurora MySQL 2.\* database clusters to Aurora MySQL 2.07.9. In-place upgrade is available for Aurora MySQL 1.\* clusters to Aurora MySQL 2.\*
(see [Upgrading from Aurora MySQL 1.x to 2.x](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-updates-majorversionupgrade.md#AuroraMySQL.Updates.MajorVersionUpgrade.1to2)). It's also available for Aurora MySQL 2.\* clusters to Aurora MySQL 3.\*
(see [Upgrading from Aurora MySQL 2.x to 3.x](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-updates-majorversionupgrade.md#AuroraMySQL.Updates.MajorVersionUpgrade.2to3)).

Immediately after an in-place engine version upgrade to Aurora MySQL 2.07.9 is performed, an operating system upgrade is applied
automatically to all of the affected instances on the db.r4, db.r5, db.t2, and db.t3 DB instance classes, if the instances are running an
old operating system version. In a Multi-AZ DB cluster, all of the reader instances apply the operating system upgrade first. When
the operating system upgrade on the first reader instance is finished, a failover occurs and the previous writer instance is
upgraded.

###### Note

The operating system upgrade isn't applied automatically to Aurora global databases during major version upgrades.
