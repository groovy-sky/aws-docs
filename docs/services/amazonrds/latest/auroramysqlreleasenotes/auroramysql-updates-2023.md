# Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2018-08-23 (version 2.02.3) (Deprecated)

**Version:** 2.02.3

Aurora MySQL 2.02.3 is generally available. Aurora MySQL 2.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.7
and Aurora MySQL 1.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.6.

When creating a new Aurora MySQL DB cluster, you can choose
compatibility with either MySQL 5.7 or MySQL 5.6. When restoring a MySQL 5.6-compatible snapshot,
you can choose compatibility with either MySQL 5.7 or MySQL 5.6.

You can restore snapshots of Aurora MySQL 1.14.\*, 1.15.\*, 1.16.\*, 1.17.\*, 2.01.\*, and 2.02.\* into Aurora MySQL
2.02.3. You can also perform an in-place upgrade from Aurora MySQL 2.01.\* or 2.02.\* to Aurora MySQL 2.02.3.

We don't allow in-place upgrade of Aurora MySQL 1.\* clusters into Aurora MySQL 2.02.3 or restore
to Aurora MySQL 2.02.3 from an Amazon S3 backup. We plan to remove these restrictions in a later Aurora MySQL
2.\* release.

The performance schema is disabled for this release of Aurora MySQL 5.7. Upgrade to Aurora 2.03 for performance schema support.

###### Note

This version is currently not available in the AWS GovCloud (US-West) \[us-gov-west-1\] and China (Beijing)

## Comparison with Aurora MySQL version 1

The following Amazon Aurora MySQL features are supported in Aurora MySQL version 1 (compatible with
MySQL 5.6), but these features are currently not supported in Aurora MySQL version 2 (compatible
with MySQL 5.7).

- Asynchronous key prefetch (AKP). For more
information, see [Optimizing Aurora indexed join queries with asynchronous key prefetch](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.AKP) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Hash joins. For more information, see [Optimizing large Aurora MySQL join queries with hash joins](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.HashJoin) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Native functions for synchronously invoking AWS Lambda functions. For more
information, see [Invoking a Lambda function with an Aurora MySQL native function](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-integrating-lambda.md#AuroraMySQL.Integrating.NativeLambda) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Scan batching. For more information, see [Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2017-12-11 (version 1.16) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-20171211.md).

- Migrating data from MySQL using an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Migrating data from MySQL by using an Amazon S3 bucket](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-migrating-extmysql.md#AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.S3) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

Currently, Aurora MySQL 2.01 does not support features added in Aurora MySQL version 1.16 and later.
For information about Aurora MySQL version 1.16, see [Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2017-12-11 (version 1.16) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-20171211.md).

## MySQL 5.7 compatibility

Aurora MySQL 2.02.3 is wire-compatible with MySQL 5.7 and includes features such as JSON support, spatial indexes,
and generated columns. Aurora MySQL uses a native implementation of spatial indexing using z-order curves to deliver
>20x better write performance and >10x better read performance than MySQL 5.7 for spatial datasets.

Aurora MySQL 2.02.3 does not currently support the following MySQL 5.7 features:

- Global transaction identifiers (GTIDs). Aurora MySQL supports GTIDs in version 2.04 and higher.

- Group replication plugin

- Increased page size

- InnoDB buffer pool loading at startup

- InnoDB full-text parser plugin

- Multisource replication

- Online buffer pool resizing

- Password validation plugin

- Query rewrite plugins

- Replication filtering

- The `CREATE TABLESPACE` SQL statement

- X Protocol

## CLI differences between Aurora MySQL 2.x and Aurora MySQL 1.x

- The engine name for Aurora MySQL 2.x is `aurora-mysql`; the engine name for Aurora MySQL 1.x continues to be `aurora`.

- The default parameter group for Aurora MySQL 2.x is `default.aurora-mysql5.7`; the default parameter group for Aurora MySQL 1.x
continues to be `default.aurora5.6`.

- The DB cluster parameter group family name for Aurora MySQL 2.x is `aurora-mysql5.7`; the DB cluster parameter group family
name for Aurora MySQL 1.x continues to be `aurora5.6`.

Refer to the Aurora documentation for the full set of CLI commands and differences between Aurora MySQL 2.x and Aurora MySQL 1.x.

## Improvements

- Fixed an issue where an Aurora Replica can restart when using optimistic cursor restores while reading records.

- Updated the default value of the parameter `innodb_stats_persistent_sample_pages` to 128 to improve index statistics.

- Fixed an issue where an Aurora Replica might restart when it accesses a small table that is being concurrently modified on the Aurora primary instance.

- Fixed `ANALYZE TABLE` to stop flushing the table definition cache.

- Fixed an issue where the Aurora primary instance or an Aurora Replica might restart when converting a point query for geospatial to a search range.
