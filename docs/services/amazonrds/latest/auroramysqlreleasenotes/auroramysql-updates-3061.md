Currently supported Aurora MySQL releases are 2.07.9, 2.07.10, 2.11.\*, 2.12.\*, 3.03.\*, 3.04.\*, 3.05.\*, 3.06.\*, and 3.07.\*.

You can perform an in-place upgrade, restore a snapshot, or initiate a managed blue/green upgrade using [Amazon RDS Blue/Green\
Deployments](../aurorauserguide/blue-green-deployments-overview.md) from any currently supported Aurora MySQL version 2 cluster into an Aurora MySQL version 3.06.1 cluster.

For information on planning an upgrade to Aurora MySQL version 3, see
[Planning \
a major version upgrade for an Aurora MySQL DB cluster](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-updates-majorversionupgrade.md#AuroraMySQL.Upgrading.Planning). For general information about Aurora MySQL upgrades, see
[Upgrading Amazon Aurora MySQL DB clusters](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-updates-upgrading.md) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## Improvements

**Fixed security issues and CVEs:**

This release includes all community CVE fixes up to and including MySQL 8.0.34. The
following CVE fixes are included:

- [CVE-2023-44487](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-44487)

- [CVE-2024-0853](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0853)

**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue that causes an Aurora MySQL DB instance to restart when running a parallel query.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a reader DB instance to restart when reading a
table that is being altered or dropped on the writer DB instance.

- Fixed an issue that caused a memory access violation leading to releasing a
mutex object no longer owned by the thread.

- Fixed an issue that can cause an Aurora MySQL writer DB instance to restart when a write forwarding session is closed while running a forwarded query.

- Fixed an issue that causes a DB instance restart when handling large GTID sets on a binary log–enabled instance.

- Fixed an issue that, in rare conditions, can cause a reader instance to restart when performing `SELECT` queries on tables with a
foreign key constraint.

- Fixed an issue that causes a DB instance to restart when attempting to recover
the InnoDB data dictionary during database recovery.

- Fixed an issue in Aurora Serverless v2 that can lead to a database restart while scaling up.

**General improvements:**

- Fixed an issue in metrics publishing code where memory might be used after
being freed.

- Fixed an issue that caused repeated DB engine restarts due to a nonexistent
undo tablespace object.

- Fixed an issue with automatic truncation of undo tablespaces when they're
larger than the threshold [innodb\_max\_undo\_log\_size](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/innodb-parameters.html) in upgrade scenarios.

- Fixed an issue that provided an incorrect value for the
`threads_running` status variable when using Aurora Global
Database.

- Fixed an issue where an Aurora MySQL binary log (binlog) read replica with
[parallel secondary index optimization](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-replication-mysql.md#binlog-optimization) enabled would experience a
restart when applying replication changes on tables with foreign keys.

- [Aurora MySQL version 3.06.0](auroramysql-updates-3060.md)
added support for Amazon Bedrock integration. As part of this, new reserved keywords
( `accept`, `aws_bedrock_invoke_model`,
`aws_sagemaker_invoke_endpoint`, `content_type`, and
`timeout_ms`) were added. In Aurora MySQL version 3.06.1, these
keywords have been changed to nonreserved keywords, which are permitted as
identifiers without quoting. For more information on how MySQL handles reserved
and nonreserved keywords, see [Keywords and\
reserved words](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/keywords.html) in the MySQL documentation.

- Fixed an issue that didn't clearly return an error message to the client when
invoking the Amazon Bedrock service from an Aurora MySQL DB cluster in an AWS Region where
Amazon Bedrock isn't yet available.

- Fixed an issue that causes a DB instance to restart because of inaccurate lock
holder information in `rw_lock` when using parallel reads.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a DB instance to restart when `SHOW VOLUME STATUS` is run.

- Fixed a memory management issue that led to a decrease in freeable memory over time when running `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE ...` queries.

- Added support for the `connection_memory_limit` and
`connection_memory_chunk_size` parameters to be set at the
session level to behave similar to corresponding functionality in MySQL
Community Edition. The `connection_memory_limit` parameter sets the
maximum amount of memory that can be used by a single user connection. The
`connection_memory_chunk_size` parameter sets the chunking size
for updates to the [global memory usage counter](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-status-variables.html).

- Fixed an issue that can cause a DB instance to restart when the local storage
on the DB instance reaches full capacity.

- Fixed an issue where the Performance Schema wasn't enabled when Performance Insights automated
management was turned on for db.t4g.medium and db.t4g.large DB instances.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a writer DB instance to restart when a reader DB instance using write forwarding runs a Data Manipulation Language (DML)
statement that contains a timestamp value and the ` time_zone` database parameter is set to `UTC`.

- Fixed an issue during zero-downtime patching (ZDP) that prevents a DB instance from closing client connections upon reaching the
customer-configured minimum value of either `wait_timeout` or ` interactive_timeout`.

**Upgrades and migrations:**

- Fixed an issue that causes upgrades or migrations to fail when the target
Aurora MySQL DB engine version is 3.04.0 or higher. This occurs when the
`lower_case_table_names` DB cluster parameter is set to
`1`, and MySQL database collation is incompatible with lowercase
table names.
