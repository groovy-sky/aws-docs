## Improvements

**Security fixes:**

- [CVE-2016-8287](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8287)

- [CVE-2016-5634](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5634)

**High priority fixes:**

- Fixed an issue that caused cloning to take longer on some database clusters with high write loads.

- Fixed an issue that could cause queries on a reader DB instance with execution plans using
secondary indexes to return uncommitted data. The issue is limited to data affected by data
manipulation language (DML) operations that modify primary or secondary index key columns.

**General improvements:**

- Fixed an issue that resulted in a slow restore of an Aurora 1.x
DB cluster containing FTS (Full Text Search) indexes to
an Aurora 2.x DB cluster.

- Fixed an issue that caused slower restores of an Aurora 1.x
database snapshot containing partitioned tables with special
characters in table names to an Aurora 2.x DB cluster.

- Fixed an issue that caused errors when querying slow query logs
and general logs in reader DB instances.

The following Amazon Aurora MySQL features are supported in Aurora MySQL Version 1 (compatible with
MySQL 5.6), but these features are currently not supported in Aurora MySQL Version 2 (compatible
with MySQL 5.7).

- Asynchronous key prefetch (AKP). For more
information, see [Optimizing Aurora indexed join queries with asynchronous key prefetch](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.AKP) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Hash joins. For more information, see [Optimizing large Aurora MySQL join queries with hash joins](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.HashJoin) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Native functions for synchronously invoking AWS Lambda functions. For more
information, see [Invoking a Lambda function with an Aurora MySQL native function](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-integrating-lambda.md#AuroraMySQL.Integrating.NativeLambda) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Scan batching. For more information, see [Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2017-12-11 (version 1.16) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-20171211.md).

- Migrating data from MySQL using an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Migrating data from MySQL by using an Amazon S3 bucket](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-migrating-extmysql.md#AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.S3) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## MySQL 5.7 compatibility

This Aurora MySQL version is wire-compatible with MySQL 5.7 and includes features such as JSON support, spatial indexes,
and generated columns. Aurora MySQL uses a native implementation of spatial indexing using z-order curves to deliver
>20x better write performance and >10x better read performance than MySQL 5.7 for spatial datasets.

This Aurora MySQL version does not currently support the following MySQL 5.7 features:

- Group replication plugin

- Increased page size

- InnoDB buffer pool loading at startup

- InnoDB full-text parser plugin

- Multisource replication

- Online buffer pool resizing

- Password validation plugin

- Query rewrite plugins

- Replication filtering

- The `CREATE TABLESPACE` SQL statement
