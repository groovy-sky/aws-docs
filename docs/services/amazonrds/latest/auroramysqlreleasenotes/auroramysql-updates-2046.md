# Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2019-09-19 (version 2.04.6) (Deprecated)

**Version:** 2.04.6

Aurora MySQL 2.04.6 is generally available. Aurora MySQL 2.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.7
and Aurora MySQL 1.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.6.

You have the option to upgrade existing Aurora MySQL 2.\* database clusters to Aurora MySQL 2.04.6. We
do not allow in-place upgrade of Aurora MySQL 1.\* clusters. This restriction will be lifted in a
later Aurora MySQL 2.\* release. You can restore snapshots of Aurora MySQL 1.14.\*, 1.15.\*, 1.16.\*,
1.17.\*, 1.18.\*, 1.19.\*, 2.01.\*, 2.02.\*, 2.03.\* and 2.04.\* into Aurora MySQL 2.04.6.

To use an older version of Aurora MySQL, you can create new database clusters by specifying the engine version through the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the Amazon RDS API.

If you have any questions or concerns, AWS Support is available on the community forums and through
[AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support). For more information, see
[Maintaining an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](../aurorauserguide/user-upgradedbinstance-maintenance.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## Improvements

- Fixed an issue where the events in current binlog file on the master were not replicated on the worker if the value of the parameter `sync_binlog` was not set to 1.

- The default value of the parameter `aurora_binlog_replication_max_yield_seconds` has been changed to zero to prevent an increase in replication lag in favor of foreground query performance on the binlog master.

## Integration of MySQL bug fixes

- Bug#23054591: PURGE BINARY LOGS TO is reading the whole binlog file and causing MySql to Stall

## Comparison with Aurora MySQL version 1

The following Amazon Aurora MySQL features are supported in Aurora MySQL Version 1 (compatible with
MySQL 5.6), but these features are currently not supported in Aurora MySQL Version 2 (compatible
with MySQL 5.7).

- Asynchronous key prefetch (AKP). For more
information, see [Optimizing Aurora indexed join queries with asynchronous key prefetch](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.AKP) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Hash joins. For more information, see [Optimizing large Aurora MySQL join queries with hash joins](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.HashJoin) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Native functions for synchronously invoking AWS Lambda functions. For more
information, see [Invoking a Lambda function with an Aurora MySQL native function](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-integrating-lambda.md#AuroraMySQL.Integrating.NativeLambda) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Scan batching. For more information, see [Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2017-12-11 (version 1.16) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-20171211.md).

- Migrating data from MySQL using an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Migrating data from MySQL by using an Amazon S3 bucket](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-migrating-extmysql.md#AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.S3) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## MySQL 5.7 compatibility

Aurora MySQL 2.04.6 is wire-compatible with MySQL 5.7 and includes features such as JSON support, spatial indexes,
and generated columns. Aurora MySQL uses a native implementation of spatial indexing using z-order curves to deliver
>20x better write performance and >10x better read performance than MySQL 5.7 for spatial datasets.

Aurora MySQL 2.04.6 does not currently support the following MySQL 5.7 features:

- Group replication plugin

- Increased page size

- InnoDB buffer pool loading at startup

- InnoDB full-text parser plugin

- Multisource replication

- Online buffer pool resizing

- Password validation plugin

- Query rewrite plugins

- Replication filtering

- The `CREATE TABLESPACE` SQL statement
