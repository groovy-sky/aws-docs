# Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2019-01-18 (version 2.03.3) (Deprecated)

**Version:** 2.03.3

Aurora MySQL 2.03.3 is generally available. Aurora MySQL 2.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.7
and Aurora MySQL 1.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.6.

When creating a new Aurora MySQL DB cluster (including restoring a snapshot), you can choose
compatibility with either MySQL 5.7 or MySQL 5.6.

We don't allow in-place upgrade of Aurora MySQL 1.\* clusters into Aurora MySQL 2.03.3 or restore
to Aurora MySQL 2.03.3 from an Amazon S3 backup. We plan to remove these restrictions in a later Aurora MySQL
2.\* release.

If you have any questions or concerns, AWS Support is available on the community forums and through
[AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support). For more information, see
[Maintaining an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](../aurorauserguide/user-upgradedbinstance-maintenance.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

###### Note

This version is currently not available in the AWS GovCloud (US-West) \[us-gov-west-1\]
and China (Beijing) \[cn-north-1\] regions. There will be a separate announcement once it is made
available.

###### Note

The procedure to upgrade your DB cluster has changed. For more information, see [Upgrading the minor version or patch level of an Aurora MySQL DB cluster](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-updates-patching.md) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## Improvements

**CVE fixes**

- [CVE-2016-5436](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5436)

**Critical fixes:**

- Fixed an issue where an Aurora Replica might become dead-latched when running a backward
scan on an index.

- Fixed an issue where an Aurora Replica might restart when the Aurora primary instance runs
in-place DDL operations on partitioned tables.

- Fixed an issue where an Aurora Replica might restart during query cache invalidation after
a DDL operation on the Aurora primary instance.

- Fixed an issue where an Aurora Replica might restart during a `SELECT` query on
a table while the Aurora primary instance runs truncation on that table.

- Fixed a wrong result issue with MyISAM temporary tables where only indexed columns are
accessed.

- Fixed an issue in slow logs that generated incorrect large values
for `query_time` and `lock_time` periodically after approximately
40,000 queries.

- Fixed an issue where a schema named "tmp" could cause
migration from RDS for MySQL to Aurora MySQL to become stuck.

- Fixed an issue where the audit log might have missing events during log rotation.

- Fixed an issue where the Aurora primary instance restored from an Aurora 5.6 snapshot might
restart when the Fast DDL feature in the lab mode is enabled.

- Fixed an issue where the CPU usage is 100% caused by the dictionary stats thread.

- Fixed an issue where an Aurora Replica might restart when running a `CHECK
                        TABLE` statement.

## Integration of MySQL bug fixes

- Bug #27460607: INCORRECT BEHAVIOR OF IODKU WHEN INSERT SELECT's SOURCE TABLE IS EMPTY

- A query using a `DISTINCT` or `GROUP BY` clause could return incorrect results. (MySQL 5.7 Bug #79591, Bug #22343910)

- A `DELETE` from joined tables using a derived table in the `WHERE` clause fails with error 1093 (Bug #23074801).

## Comparison with Aurora MySQL version 1

The following Amazon Aurora MySQL features are supported in Aurora MySQL version 1 (compatible with
MySQL 5.6), but these features are currently not supported in Aurora MySQL version 2 (compatible
with MySQL 5.7).

- Asynchronous key prefetch (AKP). For more
information, see [Optimizing Aurora indexed join queries with asynchronous key prefetch](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.AKP) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Hash joins. For more information, see [Optimizing large Aurora MySQL join queries with hash joins](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.HashJoin) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Native functions for synchronously invoking AWS Lambda functions. For more
information, see [Invoking a Lambda function with an Aurora MySQL native function](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-integrating-lambda.md#AuroraMySQL.Integrating.NativeLambda) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Scan batching. For more information, see [Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2017-12-11 (version 1.16) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-20171211.md).

- Migrating data from MySQL using an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Migrating data from MySQL by using an Amazon S3 bucket](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-migrating-extmysql.md#AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.S3) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## MySQL 5.7 compatibility

Aurora MySQL 2.03.3 is wire-compatible with MySQL 5.7 and includes features such as JSON support, spatial indexes,
and generated columns. Aurora MySQL uses a native implementation of spatial indexing using z-order curves to deliver
>20x better write performance and >10x better read performance than MySQL 5.7 for spatial datasets.

Aurora MySQL 2.03.3 does not currently support the following MySQL 5.7 features:

- Global transaction identifiers (GTIDs). Aurora MySQL supports GTIDs in version 2.04 and higher.

- Group replication plugin

- Increased page size

- InnoDB buffer pool loading at startup

- InnoDB full-text parser plugin

- Multisource replication

- Online buffer pool resizing

- Password validation plugin

- Query rewrite plugins

- Replication filtering

- The `CREATE TABLESPACE` SQL statement

- X Protocol
