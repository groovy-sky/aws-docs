###### Releases and patches

- [Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database 16.11.100, February 25, 2026](#16.11.100)

### Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database 16.11.100, February 25, 2026

**Features**

- Added support for `ALTER VIEW ... OWNER TO ...` statements.

- Added support for `pg_prewarm` extension.

**Enhancements**

- Enhanced `EXPLAIN` output for `INSERT INTO` with `SELECT` statements.

- Enhanced query performance for `ENUM` usage.

- Enhanced error messaging for `INSERT INTO` statements. The messaging now points out values where it failed.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed an issue where `SELECT` statements deadlocked when sharded table attribute was referenced in a function and joined.

- Fixed `UNIQUE` and `PRIMARY KEY` constraints when used with `INCLUDE` clause where all columns (both constraint and included columns) have been incorrectly treated. This caused the index structure to differ from the original table definition.

## Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database version 16.10-limitless

This version of Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database is compatible with [PostgreSQL 16.10](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.10).
For more information about the improvements in PostgreSQL 16.10, see
[Aurora PostgreSQL 16.10](aurorapostgresql-updates.md#aurorapostgresql-versions-version1610x).

###### Releases and patches

- [Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database 16.10.100, February 24, 2026](#16.10.100)

### Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database 16.10.100, February 24, 2026

**Features**

- Added support for ENUM as shard key type.

- Added support for `CHECK` constraints involving literals as well as expressions. For more information, see [Constraints](../aurorauserguide/limitless-reference-ddl-limitations.md#limitless-reference.DDL-limitations.Constraints).

- Added support for `VIEW` s with foreign key constraints. For more information, see [Foreign keys](../aurorauserguide/limitless-reference-ddl-limitations.md#limitless-reference.DDL-limitations.FKs).

- Added support for Advisory Locks. For more information, see [Advisory Locks](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

- Added support for `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` for database migrations. You can dump from Aurora Limitless databases and restore to other Aurora Limitless clusters or regular PostgreSQL databases. This support includes preservation of sharded and reference table configurations when migrating between Aurora Limitless clusters using metadata capture functions. For more information, see [Backing up and restoring Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database](../aurorauserguide/limitless-bak.md).

**Enhancements**

- Improved performance for schema and table lookups.

- Improved performance for shard split.

- Improved performance for `INSERT INTO` and `UPDATE` queries.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed an issue with privilege grants which failed with `invalid role OID: 0` when all privileges are `GRANT` ed to public.

- Fixed an issue with `EXPLAIN` and `UPDATE` queries which failed with `wrong number of parameters for prepared statement`.

- Fixed an issue with `CREATE TABLE` which failed with `duplicate key value violates unique constraint`.

- Fixed an issue where database remained unusable after `DROP DATABASE` through JDBC.

- Fixed an issue with `UPDATE` queries on distributed tables which failed with `relation * does not exist`.

- Fixed an issue with `SELECT` queries with type casts which failed with `cannot cast type cstring to text[]`.

- Fixed an issue with `CREATE DATABASE` which failed with `connection_limit requires an integer value` when also setting `connection_limit`.

- Fixed table transformation from standard table to distributed table or reference table to keep Row Level Security Policies.

- Fixed correctness and data leak issues in Row Level Security (RLS) policies. We recommend to drop and re-create any existing RLS policies.

- Fixed `DROP POLICY` statement when used with `IF EXISTS`.

- Fixed incorrect result when selecting `tableoid` system column. The `tableoid` is the OID of the table, which is a distinct identification given to the database object by a given system. If the query is eligible for Single Shard Optimization, the `tableoid` will be obtained from the Shard. Otherwise, the `tableoid` will be obtained from the connected router. Different routers may result in different `tableoid` for the same query.

- Fixed stats update for tables with User Defined Types.

- Fixed an issue with `CREATE TABLE` which failed with `FATAL: Unexpected error occurred while committing transaction` when `debug_parallel_query` is set to `on`.

### Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database 16.6.101, April 17, 2025

This release includes Aurora PostgreSQL patches till
[16.6.3](aurorapostgresql-updates.md#aurorapostgresql-versions-version1663x-1663).

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed multiple issues that might lead to brief periods of unavailability.

- Fixed a correctness issue when `limitless_minimum_adaptive_fetch_size` is set to lower than the default value (100).

- Enhanced error handling for querying tableoid attribute of a relation in Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database,
considering it might have different values across nodes in `DBShardGroup`.

- Fixed a permission issue that can occur when using `rds_aurora.limitless_active_shard_key`.
This resolves permission errors when retrieving data.

- Fixed a race condition in clog background operation whcih may cause the client to recieve the _commit time is invalid_ error.

- Optimized execution of distributed functions with variable length shard key.
Previously, routers performed distributed functions but they are performed locally now on a single shard as per shard key.

- Fixed an error when executing `update/delete` on standard table joining reference tables.

- Fixed an issue where any user could invoke specific internal limitless functions.

- Fixed an issue that lead to incorrect rollback for subtransaction during node crash.

- Fixed issues where expressions with nested parentheses in `DEFAULT/CHECK` constraints might generate incorrect results.

### Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database 16.6.100, January 24, 2025

**Features**

- Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database now supports Aurora PostgreSQL version 16.6.

- You can now install and use the `btree_gin` extension.

- The `DISCARD` Data Manipulation Language (DML) command is supported.

**Enhancements**

- Improved query performance with better pushdown capabilities for queries that include reference tables within subqueries. This enhancement
optimizes query execution, potentially resulting in faster performance for complex queries involving reference table joins in subqueries.

- Enhanced the error handling for `pg_advisory_lock`. Previously, attempts to use this unsupported feature didn't generate an explicit
error message, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. Now, users will receive a clear error notification when attempting to use
`pg_advisory_lock`, ensuring better clarity and preventing unintended consequences.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed an issue where certain `ALTER TABLE` and `CREATE TABLE` commands fail with the error: **`Unable to deparse the**
**given statement`**.

- Fixed an issue where an `ALTER TABLE` command with a `NOT NULL` or `DEFAULT` constraint fails when it contains
functions unsafe to push down to shards (such as volatile functions), requiring backfilling data in existing rows.

**Known issues**

- Setting the `rds_aurora.limitless_minimum_adaptive_fetch_size` variable can cause incorrect results.

## Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database version 16.4-limitless

This version of Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database is compatible with [PostgreSQL 16.4](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.4).
For more information about the improvements in PostgreSQL 16.4, see

### Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database 16.4.106, October 13, 2025

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed an issue where tables weren't deleted on shards when `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP` statements were repeatedly executed using prepared statements through JDBC or ODBC drivers (for example, when using `preferQueryMode=extendedCacheEverything` in JDBC), or when `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP` statements were executed as part of `PROCEDURE` or `FUNCTION`.

- Fixed incorrect results when querying tables using `UNIQUE INDEX` scans while the table had broken Heap-Only Tuple (HOT) chains from `UPDATE` statements.

- Fixed an issue where healthy nodes were unnecessarily replaced, causing system unavailability.

### Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database 16.4.105, April 17, 2025

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed multiple issues that could lead to brief periods of unavailability.

- Fixed an issue resulting in incorrect results for anti-join queries containing a predicate on an outer relation.

- Added pushdown capability for the following system functions:

- `pg_char_to_encoding`

- `pg_encoding_to_char`

- `textanycat`

- `anytextcat`

- Enhanced error handling for `pg_advisory_lock` in Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database.
With this change, you receive a clear error notification when attempting to use `pg_advisory_lock`.

### Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database 16.4.104, November 19, 2024

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed an issue where deadlocks can occur in processing Data Definition Language (DDL) statements when `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`
runs.

- Fixed an issue where an error in distributed deadlock resolution can block the detection of subsequent distributed deadlocks.

- Fixed an issue where DDL statements with underlying Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements (such as `CREATE TABLE AS` or calling
for a table with data) result in errors if the `rds_aurora.limitless_active_shard_key` variable is used in a session.

- Fixed an issue where a shard split operation results in an error.

- Fixed an issue where the `rds_aurora.limitless_alter_table_type_sharded` procedure for converting the table type to sharded fails if
the `rds_aurora.limitless_alter_table_type_sharded` variable is set.

- Fixed an issue in the deparsing logic of polymorphic objects that resulted in invalid queries not producing errors when the implicit cast of
passing data caused incorrect object versions to be used.

**Known issues**

- An issue can occur when part of a query is converted to a left or anti-join condition. In these cases, if the inner relation has no results a null
row is used.

- An issue can occur when adding a column with a `NOT NULL` or `DEFAULT` constraint, that contains functions unsafe to push
down to shards (such as volatile functions), requires backfilling data in existing rows.

- An issue can occur when the deparsing logic for preparing queries to shards doesn't use parentheses where possible. This can lead to errors when
`COLLATE` is used in queries.
