# Amazon RDS Proxyfor Aurora

By using Amazon RDS Proxy, you can allow your applications to pool and share database
connections to improve their ability to scale. RDS Proxy makes applications more resilient to
database failures by automatically connecting to a standby DB instance while preserving
application connections. By using RDS Proxy, you can enforce AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication
for clients connecting to the proxy, and the proxy can connect to databases using either IAM
database authentication or credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

Using RDS Proxy, you can handle unpredictable surges in database traffic. Otherwise, these
surges might cause issues due to oversubscribing connections or new connections being created at a
fast rate. RDS Proxy establishes a database connection pool and reuses connections in this pool.
This approach avoids the memory and CPU overhead of opening a new database connection each time.
To protect a database against oversubscription, you can control the number of database
connections that are created.

RDS Proxy queues or throttles application connections that can't be served immediately from the connection pool.
Although latencies might increase, your application can continue to scale without abruptly failing
or overwhelming the database. If connection requests exceed the limits you specify, RDS Proxy rejects application
connections (that is, it sheds load). At the same time, it maintains predictable performance for the load that RDS can serve with the available capacity.

You can reduce the overhead to process credentials and establish a secure connection for each new connection.
RDS Proxy can handle some of that work on behalf of the database.

RDS Proxy is fully compatible with the engine versions that it supports. You can enable RDS Proxy for most applications with no
code changes. For a list of supported engine versions, see [Supported Regions and Aurora DB engines for Amazon RDS Proxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.RDS_Proxy.html).

## Region and version availability

For information about database engine version support and availability of RDS Proxy in a given AWS Region, see
[Supported Regions and Aurora DB engines for Amazon RDS Proxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.RDS_Proxy.html).

## Quotas and limitations for RDS Proxy

The following quotas and limitations apply to RDS Proxy:

- Each AWS account ID is limited to 20 proxies. If your application requires more
proxies, request an increase via the **Service Quotas** page within the
AWS Management Console. In the **Service Quotas** page, select **Amazon Relational Database Service**
**(Amazon RDS)** and locate **Proxies** to request a quota increase.
AWS can automatically increase your quota or pending review of your request by
Support.

- Each proxy can have up to 200 associated Secrets Manager secrets, thus limiting connections
to up to 200 different user accounts when using secrets.

- Each proxy has a default endpoint which is provisioned across only two Availability Zones selected from the proxy's configured subnets.
If subnets in more than two AZs are configured, any two will be selected.

- You can add up to 20 additional proxy endpoints for each proxy.
These additional endpoints are provisioned across all the Availability Zones specified during their creation.
You can create, view, modify, and delete these endpoints.

- In an Aurora cluster, all of the connections using the default proxy endpoint are handled by the Aurora writer
instance. To perform load balancing for read-intensive workloads, you can create a read-only endpoint
for a proxy. That endpoint passes connections to the reader endpoint of the cluster. That way, your proxy connections
can take advantage of Aurora read scalability.
For more information, see [Overview of proxy endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/rds-proxy-endpoints.html#rds-proxy-endpoints-overview).

- You can use RDS Proxy with Aurora Serverless v2 clusters, but not with Aurora Serverless
v1 clusters.

- Your RDS Proxy must be in the same virtual private cloud (VPC) as the database. The
proxy can't be publicly accessible, although the database can be. For example, if you're
prototyping your database on a local host, you can't connect to your proxy unless you set up
the necessary network requirements to allow connection to the proxy.
This is because your local host is outside of the proxy’s VPC.

###### Note

For Aurora DB clusters, you can turn on cross-VPC access. To do this, create an
additional endpoint for a proxy and specify a different VPC, subnets, and security
groups with that endpoint. For more information, see [Accessing Aurora databases across VPCs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/rds-proxy-endpoints.html#rds-proxy-cross-vpc).

- You can't use RDS Proxy with a VPC that has its tenancy set to `dedicated`.

- You can't use RDS Proxy in a VPC that has encryption controls with `Enforce Mode` enabled.

- For IPv6 endpoint network types, configure your VPC and subnets to support only IPv6.
For both IPv4 and IPv6 target connection network types, configure your VPC and subnets to support dual-stack mode.

- If you use RDS Proxy with an Aurora DB cluster that has IAM authentication enabled,
the proxy can connect to the database using either IAM authentication or credentials stored in Secrets Manager.
Clients connecting to the proxy must authenticate using IAM credentials. For detailed configuration instructions,
see [Setting up database credentials for RDS Proxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/rds-proxy-secrets-arns.html)
and [Configuring IAM authentication for RDS Proxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/rds-proxy-iam-setup.html)

- You can't use RDS Proxy with custom DNS when using SSL hostname validation.

- Each proxy can be associated with a single target DB
cluster. However, you
can associate multiple proxies with the same DB
cluster.

- Any statement with a text size greater than 16 KB causes the proxy to pin the session to the current connection.

- Certain Regions have Availability-Zone (AZ) restrictions to consider while creating your proxy.
US East (N. Virginia) Region does not support RDS Proxy in the `use1-az3` Availability Zone.
US West (N. California) Region does not support RDS Proxy in the `usw1-az2` Availability Zone.
When selecting subnets while creating your proxy,
make sure that you don't select subnets in the Availability Zones mentioned above.

- Currently, RDS Proxy doesn't support any global condition context keys.

For more information about global condition context keys,
see [AWS global condition context keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

- You can't use RDS Proxy with RDS Custom for SQL Server.

- To reflect any database parameter group modification to your proxy,
an instance reboot is required even if your chose to apply your changes immediately.
For cluster-level parameters, a cluster-wide reboot is required.

- Your proxy automatically creates the `rdsproxyadmin` DB user when you
register a proxy target. This is a protected user that is essential for proxy functionality.
You should avoid tampering with the `rdsproxyadmin` user in any capacity.
Deleting or modifying the `rdsproxyadmin` user
or its permissions can result in complete unavailability of the proxy to your application.

For additional limitations for each DB engine, see the following sections:

- [Additional limitations for Aurora MySQL](#rds-proxy.limitations-my)

- [Additional limitations for Aurora PostgreSQL](#rds-proxy.limitations-pg)

### Additional limitations for Aurora MySQL

The following additional
limitations apply to RDS Proxy with Aurora MySQL databases:

- RDS Proxy support for `caching_sha2_password` authentication requires a secure (TLS) connection.

- RDS Proxy support for `caching_sha2_password` is known to have compatibility issues with certain
go-sql driver versions.

- When using the MySQL 8.4 C driver, the `mysql_stmt_bind_named_param` API might form malformed packets
if parameter count exceeds placeholder count in a prepared statements. This results in incorrect responses. For
more information, see [MySQL bug report](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=116860&thanks=4).

- Currently, all proxies listen on port 3306 for MySQL. The proxies still connect to your database using
the port that you specified in the database settings.

- You can't use RDS Proxy with self-managed MySQL databases in EC2
instances.

- You can't use RDS Proxy with an RDS for MySQL DB instance that has the
`read_only` parameter in its DB parameter group set to
`1`.

- RDS Proxy doesn't support MySQL compressed mode. For example, it doesn't
support the compression used by the `--compress` or `-C` options
of the `mysql` command.

- Database connections processing a `GET DIAGNOSTIC` command might return
inaccurate information when RDS Proxy reuses the same database connection to run another
query. This can happen when RDS Proxy multiplexes database connections.

- Some SQL statements and functions such as `SET LOCAL` can
change the connection state without causing pinning. For the most current pinning
behavior, see [Avoiding pinning an RDS Proxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/rds-proxy-pinning.html).

- Using the `ROW_COUNT()` function in a multi-statement query is not
supported.

- RDS Proxy does not support client applications that can't
handle multiple response messages in one TLS record.

- RDS Proxy does not support the MySQL dual passwords.

- RDS Proxy might not work as expected when you configure the `init_connect` parameter in your
RDS DB parameter group to set session state variables. Instead, set the initialization query for your proxy
to run session initialization statements when using proxy to connect to your database.

###### Important

For proxies associated with MySQL databases, don't set the configuration parameter
`sql_auto_is_null` to `true` or a nonzero value in the initialization
query. Doing so might cause incorrect application behavior.

### Additional limitations for Aurora PostgreSQL

The following additional limitations apply to RDS Proxy with Aurora PostgreSQL databases:

- RDS Proxy doesn't support session pinning filters for PostgreSQL.

- Currently, all proxies listen on port 5432 for PostgreSQL.

- For PostgreSQL, RDS Proxy doesn't currently support canceling a query from a client by
issuing a `CancelRequest`. This is the case, for example, when you cancel a
long-running query in an interactive psql session by using Ctrl+C.

- The results of the PostgreSQL function [lastval](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-sequence.html)
aren't always accurate. As a work-around, use the [INSERT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-insert.html) statement
with the `RETURNING` clause.

- RDS Proxy currently doesn't support streaming replication mode.

- The default `postgres` database must exist on the RDS for PostgreSQL instance
for RDS Proxy to function. Don't delete this database even if your application uses
different databases.

- If you use `ALTER ROLE` to change the user role with `SET ROLE`, subsequent connections as that
user to the proxy might not use this role setting, if those connections encounter pinning. To prevent this, when using proxy,
use `SET ROLE` in the initialization query of the proxy. For more information,
see **Initialization query** in [Creating a proxy for Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/rds-proxy-creating.html).

###### Important

For existing proxies with PostgreSQL databases, if you modify the database authentication to use `SCRAM` only,
the proxy becomes unavailable for up to 60 seconds. To avoid the issue, do one of the following:

- Ensure that the database allows both `SCRAM` and `MD5` authentication.

- To use only `SCRAM` authentication, create a new proxy, migrate your application traffic to the new proxy, then delete the proxy previously associated with the database.
