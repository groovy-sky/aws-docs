## Requirements for using Aurora machine learning with Aurora MySQL

AWS machine learning services are managed services that are set up and run in their own production environments. Aurora machine learning supports
integration with Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Comprehend, and SageMaker AI. Before trying to set up your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to use Aurora machine learning, be sure you understand
the following requirements and prerequisites.

- The machine learning services must be running in the same AWS Region as your Aurora MySQL DB cluster. You can't
use machine learning services from an Aurora MySQL DB cluster in a different Region.

- If your Aurora MySQL DB cluster is in a different virtual public cloud (VPC) from your Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Comprehend, or SageMaker AI service, the
VPC's Security group needs to allow outbound connections to the target Aurora machine learning service. For more information, see
[Control traffic to your AWS\
resources using security groups](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-groups.md) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- You can upgrade an Aurora cluster that's running a lower version of Aurora MySQL to a supported higher version if
you want to use Aurora machine learning with that cluster. For more information, see [Database engine updates for Amazon Aurora MySQL](auroramysql-updates.md).

- Your Aurora MySQL DB cluster must use a custom DB cluster parameter group. At the end of the setup process for each
Aurora machine learning service that you want to use, you add the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the associated IAM role that was
created for the service. We recommend that you create a custom DB cluster parameter group for your Aurora MySQL in advance
and configure your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to use it so that it's ready for you to modify at the end of the setup
process.

- For SageMaker AI:

- The machine learning components that you want to use for inferences must be set up and ready to use. During
the configuration process for your Aurora MySQL DB cluster, make sure to have the ARN of the SageMaker AI endpoint
available. The data scientists on your team are likely best able to handle working with SageMaker AI to prepare the
models and handle the other such tasks. To get started with Amazon SageMaker AI, see [Get Started with Amazon SageMaker AI](../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/gs.md). For more information about inferences
and endpoints, see [Real-time\
inference](../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/realtime-endpoints.md).

- To use SageMaker AI with your own training data, you must set up an Amazon S3 bucket as part of your Aurora MySQL
configuration for Aurora machine learning. To do so, you follow the same general process as for setting up the SageMaker AI integration.
For a summary of this optional setup process, see [Setting up your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to use Amazon S3 for SageMaker AI (Optional)](#aurora-ml-setting-up-access-sagemaker-advanced-s3).

- For Aurora global databases, you set up the Aurora machine learning services that you want to use in all AWS Regions that make up your
Aurora global database. For example, if you want to use Aurora machine learning with SageMaker AI for your Aurora global database, you do the
following for every Aurora MySQL DB cluster in every AWS Region:

- Set up the Amazon SageMaker AI services with the same SageMaker AI training models and endpoints. These must also use the same
names.

- Create the IAM roles as detailed in [Setting up your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to use Aurora machine learning](#aurora-ml-setting-up-access).

- Add the ARN of the IAM role to the custom DB cluster parameter group for each Aurora MySQL DB cluster in every
AWS Region.

These tasks require that Aurora machine learning is available for your version of Aurora MySQL in all AWS Regions that make up your
Aurora global database.

## Region and version availability

Feature availability and support varies across specific versions of each Aurora database engine, and across
AWS Regions.

- For information on version and Region availability for Amazon Comprehend and Amazon SageMaker AI with Aurora MySQL, see [Aurora machine learning with Aurora MySQL](concepts-aurora-fea-regions-db-eng-feature-aurora-ml.md#Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.Aurora_ML.amy).

- Amazon Bedrock is supported only on Aurora MySQL version 3.06 and higher.

For information on Region availability for Amazon Bedrock, see [Model\
support by AWS Region](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/models-regions.md) in the _Amazon Bedrock User Guide_.

## Supported features and limitations of Aurora machine learning with Aurora MySQL

When using Aurora MySQL with Aurora machine learning, the following limitations apply:

- The Aurora machine learning extension doesn't support vector interfaces.

- Aurora machine learning integrations aren't supported when used in a trigger.

- Aurora machine learning functions aren't compatible with binary logging (binlog) replication.

- The setting `--binlog-format=STATEMENT` throws an exception for calls to Aurora machine learning functions.

- Aurora machine learning functions are nondeterministic, and nondeterministic stored functions aren't compatible with the
binlog format.

For more information, see [Binary Logging\
Formats](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/binary-log-formats.html) in the MySQL documentation.

- Stored functions that call tables with generated-always columns aren't supported. This applies to any Aurora MySQL
stored function. To learn more about this column type, see [CREATE TABLE and Generated\
Columns](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-table-generated-columns.html) in the MySQL documentation.

- Amazon Bedrock functions don't support `RETURNS JSON`. You can use `CONVERT` or `CAST` to
convert from `TEXT` to `JSON` if needed.

- Amazon Bedrock doesn't support batch requests.

- Aurora MySQL supports any SageMaker AI endpoint that reads and writes the comma-separated value (CSV) format, through a
`ContentType` of `text/csv`. This format is accepted by the following built-in SageMaker AI
algorithms:

- Linear Learner

- Random Cut Forest

- XGBoost

To learn more about these algorithms, see [Choose an Algorithm](../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/algorithms-choose.md) in the _Amazon SageMaker AI Developer Guide_.

### Setting up your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to use Amazon Bedrock

Aurora machine learning relies on AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies to allow your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to access and use the Amazon Bedrock
services. The following procedures create an IAM permission policy and role so that your DB cluster can integrate with
Amazon Bedrock.

###### To create the IAM policy

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. Choose **Policies** in the navigation pane.

3. Choose **Create a policy**.

4. On the **Specify permissions** page, for **Select a service**, choose
    **Bedrock**.

The Amazon Bedrock permissions display.

5. Expand **Read**, then select **InvokeModel**.

6. For **Resources**, select **All**.

The **Specify permissions** page should resemble the following figure.

![Amazon Bedrock IAM permission policy for the InvokeModel operation.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ams-ml-br-iam-policy.png)

7. Choose **Next**.

8. On the **Review and create** page, enter a name for your policy, for example
    `BedrockInvokeModel`.

9. Review your policy, then choose **Create policy**.

Next you create the IAM role that uses the Amazon Bedrock permission policy.

###### To create the IAM role

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. Choose **Roles** in the navigation pane.

3. Choose **Create role**.

4. On the **Select trusted entity** page, for **Use case**, choose
    **RDS**.

5. Select **RDS - Add Role to Database**, then choose **Next**.

6. On the **Add permissions** page, for **Permissions policies**, select the IAM
    policy that you created, then choose **Next**.

7. On the **Name, review, and create** page, enter a name for your role, for example
    `ams-bedrock-invoke-model-role`.

The role should resemble the following figure.

![Amazon Bedrock IAM role for the InvokeModel operation.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ams-ml-br-iam-role.png)

8. Review your role, then choose **Create role**.

Next you associate the Amazon Bedrock IAM role with your DB cluster.

###### To associate the IAM role with your DB cluster

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose **Databases** from the navigation pane.

3. Choose the Aurora MySQL DB cluster that you want to connect to Amazon Bedrock services.

4. Choose the **Connectivity & security** tab.

5. For **Manage IAM roles** section, choose **Select IAM to add to this**
**cluster**.

6. Choose the IAM that you created, and then choose **Add role**.

The IAM role is associated with your DB cluster, first with the status **Pending**, then
    **Active**. When the process completes, you can find the role in the **Current IAM**
**roles for this cluster** list.

![IAM role associated with your DB cluster.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ams-ml-br-manage-iam-roles.png)

You must add the ARN of this IAM role to the `aws_default_bedrock_role` parameter of the custom DB cluster
parameter group associated with your Aurora MySQL DB cluster. If your Aurora MySQL DB cluster doesn't use a custom DB
cluster parameter group, you need to create one to use with your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to complete the integration. For more
information, see [DB cluster parameter groups for Amazon Aurora DB clusters](user-workingwithdbclusterparamgroups.md).

###### To configure the DB cluster parameter

1. In the Amazon RDS Console, open the **Configuration** tab of your Aurora MySQL DB cluster.

2. Locate the DB cluster parameter group configured for your cluster. Choose the link to open your custom DB cluster
    parameter group, then choose **Edit**.

3. Find the `aws_default_bedrock_role` parameter in your custom DB cluster parameter group.

4. In the **Value** field, enter the ARN of the IAM role.

5. Choose **Save changes** to save the setting.

6. Reboot the primary instance of your Aurora MySQL DB cluster so that this parameter setting takes effect.

The IAM integration for Amazon Bedrock is complete. Continue setting up your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to work with Amazon Bedrock by [Granting database users access to Aurora machine learning](#aurora-ml-sql-privileges).

### Setting up your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to use Amazon Comprehend

Aurora machine learning relies on AWS Identity and Access Management roles and policies to allow your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to
access and use the Amazon Comprehend services. The following procedure automatically creates an IAM role and policy for
your cluster so that it can use Amazon Comprehend.

###### To set up your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to use Amazon Comprehend

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose **Databases** from the navigation pane.

3. Choose the Aurora MySQL DB cluster that you want to connect to Amazon Comprehend services.

4. Choose the **Connectivity & security** tab.

5. For **Manage IAM roles** section, choose **Select a service to connect to this**
**cluster**.

6. Choose **Amazon Comprehend** from the menu, and then choose **Connect service**.

![Image showing Amazon Comprehend chosen for the Aurora MySQL DB cluster.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ams-ml-cmp-iam-role.png)

7. The **Connect cluster to Amazon Comprehend** dialog doesn't require any additional information. However, you might see a
    message notifying you that the integration between Aurora and Amazon Comprehend is currently in preview. Be sure to read the
    message before you continue. You can choose **Cancel** if you prefer not to proceed.

8. Choose **Connect service** to complete the integration process.

Aurora creates the IAM role. It also creates the policy that allows the Aurora MySQL DB cluster to use Amazon Comprehend services and
    attaches the policy to the role. When the process completes, you can find the role in the **Current IAM**
**roles for this cluster** list as shown in the following image.

![Completed IAM integration for using Amazon Comprehend with Aurora MySQL showing the Active role.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ams-ml-cmp-iam-role-4.png)

You need to add the ARN of this IAM role to the `aws_default_comprehend_role` parameter of the custom DB cluster
    parameter group associated with your Aurora MySQL DB cluster. If your Aurora MySQL DB cluster doesn't use a custom
    DB cluster parameter group, you need to create one to use with your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to complete the
    integration. For more information, see [DB cluster parameter groups for Amazon Aurora DB clusters](user-workingwithdbclusterparamgroups.md).

After creating your custom DB cluster parameter group and associating it with your Aurora MySQL DB cluster, you can continue
    following these steps.

If your cluster uses a custom DB cluster parameter group, do as follows.

1. In the Amazon RDS Console, open the **Configuration** tab of your Aurora MySQL DB
       cluster.

2. Locate the DB cluster parameter group configured for your cluster. Choose the link to open your custom DB
       cluster parameter group, then choose **Edit**.

3. Find the `aws_default_comprehend_role` parameter in your custom DB cluster parameter group.

4. In the **Value** field, enter the ARN of the IAM role.

5. Choose **Save changes** to save the setting. In the following image, you can find an example.

      ![Adding the ARN of the IAM role to the Aurora MySQL's custom DB cluster parameter group.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ams-cmp-add-arn-to-custom-db-cluster-params.png)

Reboot the primary instance of your Aurora MySQL DB cluster so that this parameter setting takes effect.

The IAM integration for Amazon Comprehend is complete. Continue setting up your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to work with Amazon Comprehend by granting access to
the appropriate database users.

### Setting up your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to use SageMaker AI

The following procedure automatically creates the IAM role and policy for your Aurora MySQL DB cluster
so that it can use SageMaker AI. Before trying to follow this procedure, be sure that you have the SageMaker AI endpoint
available so that you can enter it when needed. Typically, data scientists on your team would do the work to
produce an endpoint that you can use from your Aurora MySQL DB cluster. You can find such endpoints in the
[SageMaker AI console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home). In the navigation pane, open the
**Inference** menu and choose **Endpoints**. In the following image,
you can find an example.

![Image showing SageMaker AI chosen for the Aurora MySQL DB cluster.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ams-sm-endpoint-arn.png)

###### To set up your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to use SageMaker AI

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

02. Choose **Databases** from the Amazon RDS navigation menu and then
     choose the Aurora MySQL DB cluster that you want to connect to SageMaker AI services.

03. Choose the **Connectivity & security** tab.

04. Scroll to the **Manage IAM roles** section, and then choose **Select**
    **a service to connect to this cluster**. Choose **SageMaker AI** from
     the selector.

    ![Image showing SageMaker AI chosen for the Aurora MySQL DB cluster.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ams-sm-iam-role-1.png)

05. Choose **Connect service**.

06. In the **Connect cluster to SageMaker AI** dialog, enter the ARN of the SageMaker AI endpoint.

    ![Image showing the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for SageMaker AI endpoint entered during the configuration process.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ams-sm-iam-role-3.png)

07. Aurora creates the IAM role. It also creates the policy that allows the Aurora MySQL DB cluster to use SageMaker AI services and
     attaches the policy to the role. When the process completes, you can find the role in the **Current IAM**
    **roles for this cluster** list.

08. Open the IAM console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

09. Choose **Roles** from the Access management section of the
     AWS Identity and Access Management navigation menu.

10. Find the role from among those listed. Its name uses the following pattern.

    ```nohighlight

    rds-sagemaker-your-cluster-name-role-auto-generated-digits
    ```

11. Open the role's Summary page and locate the ARN. Note the ARN or copy it using the
     copy widget.

12. Open the Amazon RDS console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

13. Choose your Aurora MySQL DB cluster, and then choose its **Configuration** tab.

14. Locate the DB cluster parameter group, and choose the link to open your custom DB cluster parameter group. Find the
     `aws_default_sagemaker_role` parameter and enter the ARN of the IAM role in the Value field and Save the setting.

15. Reboot the primary instance of your Aurora MySQL DB cluster so that this parameter setting takes effect.

The IAM setup is now complete. Continue setting up your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to work with
SageMaker AI by granting access to the appropriate database users.

If you want to use your SageMaker AI models for training rather than using pre-built SageMaker AI components, you also need to
add the Amazon S3 bucket to your Aurora MySQL DB cluster, as outlined in the [Setting up your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to use Amazon S3 for SageMaker AI (Optional)](#aurora-ml-setting-up-access-sagemaker-advanced-s3) that follows.

#### Setting up your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to use Amazon S3 for SageMaker AI (Optional)

To use SageMaker AI with your own models rather than using the pre-built components provided by SageMaker AI, you need to set up an Amazon S3 bucket
for the Aurora MySQL DB cluster to use. For more information about creating an Amazon S3 bucket, see [Creating a bucket](../../../s3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

###### To set up your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to use an Amazon S3 bucket for SageMaker AI

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose **Databases** from the Amazon RDS navigation menu and then
    choose the Aurora MySQL DB cluster that you want to connect to SageMaker AI services.

3. Choose the **Connectivity & security** tab.

4. Scroll to the **Manage IAM roles** section, and then choose **Select**
**a service to connect to this cluster**. Choose **Amazon S3** from
    the selector.

![Choosing Amazon S3 as the service to integrate with the Aurora MySQL DB cluster.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ams-ml-s3-1.png)

5. Choose **Connect service**.

6. In the **Connect cluster to Amazon S3** dialog, enter the ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket, as shown in the following image.

![Image of ARN for Amazon S3 bucket specified for the Aurora MySQL DB cluster.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ams-ml-s3-2.png)

7. Choose **Connect service** to complete this process.

For more information about using Amazon S3 buckets with SageMaker AI, see [Specify an Amazon S3 Bucket to Upload Training Datasets\
and Store Output Data](../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning-ex-bucket.md) in the _Amazon SageMaker AI Developer Guide_. To learn more about working with SageMaker AI, see
[Get Started with Amazon SageMaker AI Notebook\
Instances](../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-console.md) in the in the _Amazon SageMaker AI Developer Guide_.

### Granting database users access to Aurora machine learning

Database users must be granted permission to invoke Aurora machine learning functions. How you grant permission depends on the version of MySQL
that you use for your Aurora MySQL DB cluster, as outlined in the following. How you do so depends on the version of MySQL
that your Aurora MySQL DB cluster uses.

- For Aurora MySQL version 3 (MySQL 8.0 compatible), database users must be granted the appropriate _database role_.
For more informations, see [Using Roles](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/roles.html) in
the _MySQL 8.0 Reference Manual_.

- For Aurora MySQL version 2 (MySQL 5.7 compatible), database users are granted _privileges_. For more information, see
[Access Control and Account\
Management](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/access-control.html) in the _MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual_.

The following table shows the roles and privileges that database users need to work with machine learning functions.

Aurora MySQL version 3 (role)Aurora MySQL version 2 (privilege)

AWS\_BEDROCK\_ACCESS

–

AWS\_COMPREHEND\_ACCESS

INVOKE COMPREHEND

AWS\_SAGEMAKER\_ACCESS

INVOKE SAGEMAKER

#### Granting access to Amazon Bedrock functions

To give database users access to Amazon Bedrock functions, use the following SQL statement:

```nohighlight

GRANT AWS_BEDROCK_ACCESS TO user@domain-or-ip-address;
```

Database users also need to be granted `EXECUTE` permissions for the functions that you create for working
with Amazon Bedrock:

```nohighlight

GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION database_name.function_name TO user@domain-or-ip-address;
```

Finally, database users must have their roles set to
`AWS_BEDROCK_ACCESS`:

```nohighlight

SET ROLE AWS_BEDROCK_ACCESS;
```

The Amazon Bedrock functions are now available for use.

#### Granting access to Amazon Comprehend functions

To give database users access to Amazon Comprehend functions, use the appropriate statement for
your Aurora MySQL version.

- Aurora MySQL version 3 (MySQL 8.0 compatible)

```nohighlight

GRANT AWS_COMPREHEND_ACCESS TO user@domain-or-ip-address;
```

- Aurora MySQL version 2 (MySQL 5.7 compatible)

```nohighlight

GRANT INVOKE COMPREHEND ON *.* TO user@domain-or-ip-address;
```

The Amazon Comprehend functions are now available for use. For usage examples, see [Using Amazon Comprehend with your Aurora MySQL DB cluster](#using-amazon-comprehend-for-sentiment-detection).

#### Granting access to SageMaker AI functions

To give database users access to SageMaker AI functions, use the appropriate statement for your Aurora MySQL version.

- Aurora MySQL version 3 (MySQL 8.0 compatible)

```nohighlight

GRANT AWS_SAGEMAKER_ACCESS TO user@domain-or-ip-address;
```

- Aurora MySQL version 2 (MySQL 5.7 compatible)

```nohighlight

GRANT INVOKE SAGEMAKER ON *.* TO user@domain-or-ip-address;
```

Database users also need to be granted `EXECUTE` permissions for the functions that you create for working with SageMaker AI.
Suppose that you created two functions, `db1.anomoly_score` and `db2.company_forecasts`, to invoke
the services of your SageMaker AI endpoint. You grant execute privileges as shown in the following example.

```nohighlight

GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION db1.anomaly_score TO user1@domain-or-ip-address1;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION db2.company_forecasts TO user2@domain-or-ip-address2;
```

The SageMaker AI functions are now available for use. For usage examples, see [Using SageMaker AI with your Aurora MySQL DB cluster](#using-amazon-sagemaker-to-run-your-own-ml-models).

## Using Amazon Bedrock with your Aurora MySQL DB cluster

To use Amazon Bedrock, you create a user-defined function (UDF) in your Aurora MySQL database that invokes a model. For more information,
see [Supported models in Amazon Bedrock](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.md) in the
_Amazon Bedrock User Guide_.

A UDF uses the following syntax:

```nohighlight

CREATE FUNCTION function_name (argument type)
        [DEFINER = user]
    RETURNS mysql_data_type
    [SQL SECURITY {DEFINER | INVOKER}]
    ALIAS AWS_BEDROCK_INVOKE_MODEL
    MODEL ID 'model_id'
    [CONTENT_TYPE 'content_type']
    [ACCEPT 'content_type']
    [TIMEOUT_MS timeout_in_milliseconds];
```

- Amazon Bedrock functions don't support `RETURNS JSON`. You can use `CONVERT` or `CAST` to
convert from `TEXT` to `JSON` if needed.

- If you don't specify `CONTENT_TYPE` or `ACCEPT`, the default is
`application/json`.

- If you don't specify `TIMEOUT_MS`, the value for `aurora_ml_inference_timeout` is used.

For example, the following UDF invokes the Amazon Titan Text Express model:

```nohighlight

CREATE FUNCTION invoke_titan (request_body TEXT)
    RETURNS TEXT
    ALIAS AWS_BEDROCK_INVOKE_MODEL
    MODEL ID 'amazon.titan-text-express-v1'
    CONTENT_TYPE 'application/json'
    ACCEPT 'application/json';
```

To allow a DB user to use this function, use the following SQL command:

```nohighlight

GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION database_name.invoke_titan TO user@domain-or-ip-address;
```

Then the user can call `invoke_titan` like any other function, as shown in the following example. Make sure to
format the request body according to the [Amazon Titan text models](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-titan-text.md).

````json

CREATE TABLE prompts (request varchar(1024));
INSERT INTO prompts VALUES (
'{
    "inputText": "Generate synthetic data for daily product sales in various categories - include row number, product name, category, date of sale and price. Produce output in JSON format. Count records and ensure there are no more than 5.",
    "textGenerationConfig": {
        "maxTokenCount": 1024,
        "stopSequences": [],
        "temperature":0,
        "topP":1
    }
}');

SELECT invoke_titan(request) FROM prompts;

{"inputTextTokenCount":44,"results":[{"tokenCount":296,"outputText":"
```tabular-data-json
{
    "rows": [
        {
            "Row Number": "1",
            "Product Name": "T-Shirt",
            "Category": "Clothing",
            "Date of Sale": "2024-01-01",

## Using Amazon Comprehend with your Aurora MySQL DB cluster

For Aurora MySQL, Aurora machine learning provides the following two built-in functions for working with Amazon Comprehend and your text data. You provide
the text to analyze ( `input_data`) and specify the language ( `language_code`).

**aws\_comprehend\_detect\_sentiment**

This function identifies the text as having a positive, negative, neutral, or mixed emotional posture.
This function's reference documentation is as follows.

```nohighlight

aws_comprehend_detect_sentiment(
  input_text,
  language_code
  [,max_batch_size]
)
```

To learn more, see [Sentiment](../../../comprehend/latest/dg/how-sentiment.md) in the
_Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide_.

**aws\_comprehend\_detect\_sentiment\_confidence**

This function measures the confidence level of the sentiment detected for a given text. It returns a value (type,
`double`) that indicates the confidence of the sentiment assigned by
the aws\_comprehend\_detect\_sentiment function to the text. Confidence is a
statistical metric between 0 and 1. The higher the confidence level,
the more weight you can give the result. A summary of the
function's documentation is as follows.

```nohighlight

aws_comprehend_detect_sentiment_confidence(
  input_text,
  language_code
  [,max_batch_size]
)
```

In both functions (aws\_comprehend\_detect\_sentiment\_confidence, aws\_comprehend\_detect\_sentiment) the `max_batch_size` uses
a default value of 25 if none is specified. Batch size should always
be greater than 0. You can use `max_batch_size` to tune the performance of the Amazon Comprehend function calls. A large batch
size trades off faster performance for greater memory usage on the Aurora MySQL DB cluster. For more information, see
[Performance considerations for using Aurora machine learning with Aurora MySQL](#aurora-ml-performance).

For more information about parameters and return types for the sentiment detection functions in Amazon Comprehend, see
[DetectSentiment](../../../comprehend/latest/dg/api-detectsentiment.md)

###### Example: A simple query using Amazon Comprehend functions

Here's an example of a simple query that invokes these two functions to see how happy your customers are with your support team.
Suppose you have a database table ( `support`) that stores customer feedback after each request for help. This example
query applies both built-in functions to the text in the `feedback` column of the table and outputs
the results. The confidence values returned by the function are doubles between 0.0 and 1.0. For more readable output, this
query rounds the results to 6 decimal points. For easier comparisons, this query also sorts the results in descending order,
from the result having the highest degree of confidence, first.

```nohighlight

SELECT feedback AS 'Customer feedback',
    aws_comprehend_detect_sentiment(feedback, 'en') AS Sentiment,
    ROUND(aws_comprehend_detect_sentiment_confidence(feedback, 'en'), 6)
    AS Confidence FROM support
    ORDER BY Confidence DESC;
+----------------------------------------------------------+-----------+------------+
| Customer feedback                                        | Sentiment | Confidence |
+----------------------------------------------------------+-----------+------------+
| Thank you for the excellent customer support!            | POSITIVE  |   0.999771 |
| The latest version of this product stinks!               | NEGATIVE  |   0.999184 |
| Your support team is just awesome! I am blown away.      | POSITIVE  |   0.997774 |
| Your product is too complex, but your support is great.  | MIXED     |   0.957958 |
| Your support tech helped me in fifteen minutes.          | POSITIVE  |   0.949491 |
| My problem was never resolved!                           | NEGATIVE  |   0.920644 |
| When will the new version of this product be released?   | NEUTRAL   |   0.902706 |
| I cannot stand that chatbot.                             | NEGATIVE  |   0.895219 |
| Your support tech talked down to me.                     | NEGATIVE  |   0.868598 |
| It took me way too long to get a real person.            | NEGATIVE  |   0.481805 |
+----------------------------------------------------------+-----------+------------+
 10 rows in set (0.1898 sec)
```

###### Example: Determining the average sentiment for text above a specific confidence level

A typical Amazon Comprehend query looks for rows where the sentiment is a certain value, with a confidence level greater
than a certain number. For example, the following query shows how you can determine the average sentiment of
documents in your database. The query considers only documents where the confidence of the assessment is at
least 80%.

```nohighlight

SELECT AVG(CASE aws_comprehend_detect_sentiment(productTable.document, 'en')
  WHEN 'POSITIVE' THEN 1.0
  WHEN 'NEGATIVE' THEN -1.0
  ELSE 0.0 END) AS avg_sentiment, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM productTable
WHERE productTable.productCode = 1302 AND
    aws_comprehend_detect_sentiment_confidence(productTable.document, 'en') >= 0.80;

```

## Using SageMaker AI with your Aurora MySQL DB cluster

To use SageMaker AI functionality from your Aurora MySQL DB cluster, you need to create stored functions that embed your calls to the SageMaker AI
endpoint and its inference features. You do so by using MySQL's `CREATE FUNCTION` in generally the same way that
you do for other processing tasks on your Aurora MySQL DB cluster.

To use models deployed in SageMaker AI for inference, you create user-defined functions using MySQL data definition language (DDL)
statements for stored functions. Each stored function represents the SageMaker AI endpoint hosting the model. When you define such a
function, you specify the input parameters to the model, the specific SageMaker AI endpoint to invoke, and the return type. The function
returns the inference computed by the SageMaker AI endpoint after applying the model to the input parameters.

All Aurora machine learning stored functions return numeric types or `VARCHAR`. You can use any numeric type except `BIT`.
Other types, such as `JSON`, `BLOB`, `TEXT`, and `DATE` aren't allowed.

The following example shows the `CREATE FUNCTION` syntax for working with SageMaker AI.

```sql

CREATE FUNCTION function_name (
     arg1 type1,
     arg2 type2, ...)
     [DEFINER = user]
  RETURNS mysql_type
  [SQL SECURITY { DEFINER | INVOKER } ]
  ALIAS AWS_SAGEMAKER_INVOKE_ENDPOINT
  ENDPOINT NAME 'endpoint_name'
  [MAX_BATCH_SIZE max_batch_size];

```

This is an extension of the regular `CREATE FUNCTION` DDL statement. In the
`CREATE FUNCTION` statement that defines the SageMaker AI function, you don't
specify a function body. Instead, you specify the keyword `ALIAS` where the
function body usually goes. Currently, Aurora machine learning only supports
`aws_sagemaker_invoke_endpoint` for this extended syntax. You must specify the
`endpoint_name` parameter. An SageMaker AI endpoint can have different characteristics for each model.

###### Note

For more information about `CREATE FUNCTION`, see
[CREATE PROCEDURE and\
CREATE FUNCTION Statements](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-procedure.html) in the MySQL 8.0 Reference Manual.

The `max_batch_size` parameter is optional. By default, maximum batch size is 10,000.
You can use this parameter in your function to restrict the maximum number of inputs
processed in a batched request to SageMaker AI. The `max_batch_size`
parameter can help to avoid an error caused by inputs that are too large, or to make SageMaker AI
return a response more quickly. This parameter affects the size of an internal
buffer used for SageMaker AI request processing. Specifying too large a value for
`max_batch_size` might cause substantial memory overhead on your DB instance.

We recommend that you leave the `MANIFEST` setting at its default value of
`OFF`. Although you can use the `MANIFEST ON` option, some SageMaker AI
features can't directly use the CSV exported with this option. The manifest format is not
compatible with the expected manifest format from SageMaker AI.

You create a separate stored function for each of your SageMaker AI models. This mapping of functions to models is
required because an endpoint is associated with a specific model, and each model accepts different parameters.
Using SQL types for the model inputs and the model output type helps to avoid type conversion errors passing
data back and forth between the AWS services. You can control who can apply the model. You can also control
the runtime characteristics by specifying a parameter representing the maximum batch size.

Currently, all Aurora machine learning functions have the `NOT DETERMINISTIC` property. If you
don't specify that property explicitly, Aurora sets `NOT DETERMINISTIC`
automatically. This requirement is because the SageMaker AI model can be changed without any
notification to the database. If that happens, calls to an Aurora machine learning function might return
different results for the same input within a single transaction.

You can't use the characteristics `CONTAINS SQL`, `NO SQL`,
`READS SQL DATA`, or `MODIFIES SQL DATA` in your `CREATE
        FUNCTION` statement.

Following is an example usage of invoking an SageMaker AI endpoint to detect anomalies. There is
an SageMaker AI endpoint `random-cut-forest-model`. The corresponding model is already
trained by the `random-cut-forest` algorithm. For each input, the model returns an
anomaly score. This example shows the data points whose score is greater than 3 standard
deviations (approximately the 99.9th percentile) from the mean score.

```nohighlight

CREATE FUNCTION anomaly_score(value real) returns real
  alias aws_sagemaker_invoke_endpoint endpoint name 'random-cut-forest-model-demo';

set @score_cutoff = (select avg(anomaly_score(value)) + 3 * std(anomaly_score(value)) from nyc_taxi);

select *, anomaly_detection(value) score from nyc_taxi
  where anomaly_detection(value) > @score_cutoff;

```

### Character set requirement for SageMaker AI functions that return strings

We recommend specifying a character set of `utf8mb4` as the return type for your SageMaker AI
functions that return string values. If that isn't practical, use a large enough string length for the
return type to hold a value represented in the `utf8mb4` character set. The following example
shows how to declare the `utf8mb4` character set for your function.

```nohighlight

CREATE FUNCTION my_ml_func(...) RETURNS VARCHAR(5) CHARSET utf8mb4 ALIAS ...
```

Currently, each SageMaker AI function that returns a string uses the character set
`utf8mb4` for the return value. The return value uses this character set even
if your SageMaker AI function declares a different character set for its return type implicitly or
explicitly. If your SageMaker AI function declares a different character set for the return value, the
returned data might be silently truncated if you store it in a table column that isn't
long enough. For example, a query with a `DISTINCT` clause creates a temporary
table. Thus, the SageMaker AI function result might be truncated due to the way strings are handled
internally during a query.

### Exporting data to Amazon S3 for SageMaker AI model training (Advanced)

We recommend that you get started with Aurora machine learning and SageMaker AI by using some of the provided algorithms, and that
the data scientists on your team provide you with the SageMaker AI endpoints that you can use with your SQL code.
In the following, you can find minimal information about using your own Amazon S3 bucket with your
your own SageMaker AI models and your Aurora MySQL DB cluster.

Machine learning consists of two major steps: training, and inference.
To train SageMaker AI models, you export data to an Amazon S3 bucket. The Amazon S3 bucket is used by a Jupyter SageMaker AI notebook
instance to train your model before it is deployed. You can use the `SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3`
statement to query data from an Aurora MySQL DB cluster and save it directly into text files stored in an Amazon S3
bucket. Then the notebook instance consumes the data from the Amazon S3 bucket for training.

Aurora machine learning extends the existing `SELECT INTO OUTFILE` syntax in Aurora MySQL to export data to CSV format.
The generated CSV file can be directly consumed by models that need this format for training purposes.

```nohighlight

SELECT * INTO OUTFILE S3 's3_uri' [FORMAT {CSV|TEXT} [HEADER]] FROM table_name;
```

The extension supports the standard CSV format.

- Format `TEXT` is the same as the existing MySQL export format. This is the default format.

- Format `CSV` is a newly introduced format that follows the specification in
[RFC-4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180).

- If you specify the optional keyword `HEADER`, the output file contains one header line. The
labels in the header line correspond to the column names from the `SELECT` statement.

- You can still use the keywords `CSV` and `HEADER` as identifiers.

The extended syntax and grammar of `SELECT INTO` is now as follows:

```nohighlight

INTO OUTFILE S3 's3_uri'
[CHARACTER SET charset_name]
[FORMAT {CSV|TEXT} [HEADER]]
[{FIELDS | COLUMNS}
  [TERMINATED BY 'string']
  [[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY 'char']
  [ESCAPED BY 'char']
]
[LINES
  [STARTING BY 'string']
  [TERMINATED BY 'string']
]

```

## Performance considerations for using Aurora machine learning with Aurora MySQL

The Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Comprehend, and SageMaker AI services do most of the work when invoked by an Aurora machine learning function. That means that you can scale those
resources as needed, independently. For your Aurora MySQL DB cluster, you can make your function calls as efficient as possible.
Following, you can find some performance considerations to note when working with Aurora machine learning.

### Model and prompt

Performance when using Amazon Bedrock is highly dependent on the model and prompt that you use. Choose a model and prompt that are
optimal for your use case.

### Query cache

The Aurora MySQL query cache doesn't work for Aurora machine learning functions. Aurora MySQL doesn't store query results in the query
cache for any SQL statements that call Aurora machine learning functions.

### Batch optimization for Aurora machine learning function calls

The main Aurora machine learning performance aspect that you can influence from your Aurora cluster is the batch mode setting for calls to the
Aurora machine learning stored functions. Machine learning functions typically require substantial overhead, making it impractical to call an
external service separately for each row. Aurora machine learning can minimize this overhead by combining the calls to the external Aurora machine learning
service for many rows into a single batch. Aurora machine learning receives the responses for all the input rows, and delivers the responses,
one row at a time, to the query as it runs. This optimization improves the throughput and latency of your Aurora queries
without changing the results.

When you create an Aurora stored function that's connected to an SageMaker AI endpoint, you define the batch size parameter. This
parameter influences how many rows are transferred for every underlying call to SageMaker AI. For queries that process large numbers
of rows, the overhead to make a separate SageMaker AI call for each row can be substantial. The larger the data set processed by the
stored procedure, the larger you can make the batch size.

If the batch mode optimization can be applied to an SageMaker AI function, you can tell by checking the query plan produced by the
`EXPLAIN PLAN` statement. In this case, the `extra` column in the execution plan includes
`Batched machine learning`. The following example shows a call to an SageMaker AI function that uses batch
mode.

```nohighlight

mysql> CREATE FUNCTION anomaly_score(val real) returns real alias aws_sagemaker_invoke_endpoint endpoint name 'my-rcf-model-20191126';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> explain select timestamp, value, anomaly_score(value) from nyc_taxi;
+----+-------------+----------+------------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+----------+--------------------------+
| id | select_type | table    | partitions | type | possible_keys | key  | key_len | ref  | rows | filtered | Extra                    |
+----+-------------+----------+------------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+----------+--------------------------+
|  1 | SIMPLE      | nyc_taxi | NULL       | ALL  | NULL          | NULL | NULL    | NULL |   48 |   100.00 | Batched machine learning |
+----+-------------+----------+------------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+----------+--------------------------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.01 sec)

```

When you call one of the built-in Amazon Comprehend functions, you can control the batch size by specifying the optional
`max_batch_size` parameter. his parameter restricts the maximum number of `input_text` values
processed in each batch. By sending multiple items at once, it reduces the number of round trips between Aurora and Amazon Comprehend.
Limiting the batch size is useful in situations such as a query with a `LIMIT` clause. By using a small value for
`max_batch_size`, you can avoid invoking Amazon Comprehend more times than you have input texts.

The batch optimization for evaluating Aurora machine learning functions applies in the following cases:

- Function calls within the select list or the `WHERE` clause of `SELECT` statements

- Function calls in the `VALUES` list of `INSERT` and `REPLACE` statements

- SageMaker AI functions in `SET` values in `UPDATE` statements:

```nohighlight

INSERT INTO MY_TABLE (col1, col2, col3) VALUES
    (ML_FUNC(1), ML_FUNC(2), ML_FUNC(3)),
    (ML_FUNC(4), ML_FUNC(5), ML_FUNC(6));
UPDATE MY_TABLE SET col1 = ML_FUNC(col2), SET col3 = ML_FUNC(col4) WHERE ...;

```

## Monitoring Aurora machine learning

You can monitor Aurora machine learning batch operations by querying several global variables, as shown in the following example.

```nohighlight

show status like 'Aurora_ml%';
```

You can reset the status variables by using a `FLUSH STATUS` statement. Thus, all of the figures represent totals,
averages, and so on, since the last time the variable was reset.

`Aurora_ml_logical_request_cnt`

The number of logical requests that the DB instance has evaluated to be sent to the Aurora machine learning services since the last
status reset. Depending on whether batching has been used, this value can be higher than
`Aurora_ml_actual_request_cnt`.

`Aurora_ml_logical_response_cnt`

The aggregate response count that Aurora MySQL receives from the Aurora machine learning services across all queries run by users of the DB
instance.

`Aurora_ml_actual_request_cnt`

The aggregate request count that Aurora MySQL makes to the Aurora machine learning services across all queries run by users of the DB
instance.

`Aurora_ml_actual_response_cnt`

The aggregate response count that Aurora MySQL receives from the Aurora machine learning services across all queries run by users of the DB
instance.

`Aurora_ml_cache_hit_cnt`

The aggregate internal cache hit count that Aurora MySQL receives from the Aurora machine learning services across all queries run by users of
the DB instance.

`Aurora_ml_retry_request_cnt`

The number of retried requests that the DB instance has sent to the Aurora machine learning services since the last status
reset.

`Aurora_ml_single_request_cnt`

The aggregate count of Aurora machine learning functions that are evaluated by non-batch mode across all queries run by users of the DB
instance.
