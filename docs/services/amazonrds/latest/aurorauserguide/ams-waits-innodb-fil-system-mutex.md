# synch/mutex/innodb/fil\_system\_mutex

The `synch/mutex/innodb/fil_system_mutex` event occurs when a session
is waiting to access the tablespace memory cache.

## Supported engine versions

This wait event information is supported for the following engine versions:

- Aurora MySQL versions 2 and 3

## Context

InnoDB
uses tablespaces to manage the storage area for tables and log files. The _tablespace memory cache_ is a global memory structure that
maintains information about tablespaces. MySQL uses
`synch/mutex/innodb/fil_system_mutex` waits to control concurrent access
to the tablespace memory cache.

The event `synch/mutex/innodb/fil_system_mutex` indicates that
there is currently more than one operation that needs to retrieve and manipulate
information in the tablespace memory cache for the same tablespace.

## Likely causes of increased waits

When the `synch/mutex/innodb/fil_system_mutex` event appears more
than normal, possibly indicating a performance problem, this typically occurs when all of the
following conditions are present:

- An increase in concurrent data manipulation language (DML) operations that update or delete data in the same table.

- The tablespace for this table is very large and has a lot of data pages.

- The fill factor for these data pages is low.

## Actions

We recommend different actions depending on the causes of your wait event.

### Identify the sessions and queries causing the events

Typically, databases with moderate to significant load have wait events.
The wait events might be acceptable if performance is optimal. If performance
isn't optimal, examine where the database is spending the most time. Look at
the wait events that contribute to the highest load, and find out whether you can
optimize the database and application to reduce those events.

###### To find SQL queries that are responsible for high load

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Performance Insights**.

3. Choose a DB instance. The Performance Insights dashboard appears
    for that DB instance.

4. In the **Database load** chart, choose **Slice by**
**wait**.

5. At the bottom of the page, choose **Top SQL**.

The chart lists the SQL queries that are responsible for the load. Those at the top of the
    list are most responsible. To resolve a bottleneck, focus on these statements.

For a useful overview of troubleshooting using Performance Insights, see the blog post [Analyze Amazon Aurora MySQL Workloads with Performance Insights](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/analyze-amazon-aurora-mysql-workloads-with-performance-insights).

Another way to find out which queries are causing high numbers of `synch/mutex/innodb/fil_system_mutex` waits is to check `performance_schema`, as in the following example.

### Reorganize large tables during off-peak hours

Reorganize large tables that you identify as the source of high numbers of
`synch/mutex/innodb/fil_system_mutex` wait events during a
maintenance window outside of production hours. Doing so ensures that the internal tablespaces map cleanup doesn't occur when quick access to the table is critical.
For information about reorganizing tables, see [OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/optimize-table.html)
in the _MySQL Reference_.
