# Using logical replication to perform a major version upgrade for Aurora PostgreSQL

Using logical replication and Aurora fast cloning, you can perform a major version upgrade that uses the current version of Aurora PostgreSQL database
while gradually migrating the changing data to the new major version database. This low downtime upgrade process is referred to as a blue/green upgrade.
The current version of the database is referred as the "blue" environment and the new database version is referred as the "green" environment.

Aurora fast cloning fully loads the existing data by taking a snapshot of the source
database. Fast cloning uses a copy-on-write protocol built on top of the Aurora storage
layer, which allows you to create a clone of database in a short time. This method is very effective when upgrading to a large database.

Logical replication in PostgreSQL tracks and transfers your data changes from initial instance to a new
instance running in parallel until you move to the newer version of PostgreSQL. Logical
replication uses a publish and subscribe model. For more information about Aurora PostgreSQL
logical replication, see [Replication with Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL](aurorapostgresql-replication.md).

###### Tip

You can minimize the downtime required for a major version upgrade by using the managed Amazon RDS
Blue/Green Deployment feature. For more information, see [Using Amazon Aurora Blue/Green Deployments for database updates](blue-green-deployments.md).

## Requirements

You must meet the following requirements to perform this low downtime upgrade process:

- You must have rds\_superuser permissions.

- The Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster you intend to upgrade must be running a supported
version that can perform major version upgrades using logical replication. Make
sure to apply any minor version updates and patches to your DB cluster. The
`aurora_volume_logical_start_lsn` function that is used in this
technique is supported in the following versions of Aurora PostgreSQL:

- 15.2 and higher 15 versions

- 14.3 and higher 14 versions

- 13.6 and higher 13 versions

- 12.10 and higher 12 versions

- 11.15 and higher 11 versions

- 10.20 and higher 10 versions

For more information on `aurora_volume_logical_start_lsn`
function, see [aurora\_volume\_logical\_start\_lsn](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora_volume_logical_start_lsn.html).

- All of your tables must have a primary key or include a [PostgreSQL identity column](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html).

- Configure the security group for your VPC to allow inbound and outbound access
between the two Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters, both old and new. You can grant
access to a specific classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) range or to another
security group in your VPC or in a peer VPC. (Peer VPC requires a VPC peering
connection.)

###### Note

For detailed information about the permissions required to configure and manage a
running logical replication scenario, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/logical-replication-security.html).

## Limitations

When you are performing low downtime upgrade on your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to upgrade it to a new major version,
you are using the native PostgreSQL logical replication feature. It has the same capabilities and limitations as the
PostgreSQL logical replication. For more information, see [PostgreSQL logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/logical-replication.html).

- Data definition language (DDL) commands are not replicated.

- Replication doesn't support schema changes in a live database. The schema is
recreated in its original form during the cloning process. If you change the
schema after cloning, but before completing the upgrade, it isn't reflected in
the upgraded instance.

- Large objects are not replicated, but you can store data in normal
tables.

- Replication is only supported by tables, including partitioned tables.
Replication to other types of relations, such as views, materialized views, or
foreign tables, is not supported.

- Sequence data is not replicated and requires a manual update post-failover.

###### Note

This upgrade doesn't support auto-scripting. You should perform all the steps
manually.

## Setting and checking parameter values

Before upgrading, configure the writer instance of your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to
act as a publication server. The instance should use a custom DB cluster
parameter group with the following settings:

- `rds.logical_replication` – Set this parameter to 1. The
`rds.logical_replication` parameter serves the same purpose as a
standalone PostgreSQL server's `wal_level` parameter and other
parameters that control the write-ahead log file management.

- `max_replication_slots` – Set this parameter to the total
number of subscriptions that you plan to create. If you are using AWS DMS, set
this parameter to the number of AWS DMS tasks that you plan to use for changed
data capture from this DB cluster.

- `max_wal_senders` – Set to the number of concurrent
connections, plus a few extra, to make available for management tasks and new
sessions. If you are using AWS DMS, the number of max\_wal\_senders should be equal
to the number of concurrent sessions plus the number of AWS DMS tasks that may be
working at any given time.

- `max_logical_replication_workers` – Set to the number of
logical replication workers and table synchronization workers that you expect.
It's generally safe to set the number of replication workers to the same
value used for max\_wal\_senders. The workers are taken from the pool of
background processes (max\_worker\_processes) allocated for the server.

- `max_worker_processes` – Set to the number of background
processes for the server. This number should be large enough to allocate workers
for replication, auto-vacuum processes, and other maintenance processes that may
take place concurrently.

When you upgrade to a newer version of Aurora PostgreSQL, you need to duplicate any
parameters that you modified in the earlier version of the parameter group. These
parameters are applied to the upgraded version. You can query the
`pg_settings` table to get a list of parameter settings so that you can
re-create them on your new Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.

For example, to get the settings for replication parameters, run the following query:

```sql

SELECT name, setting FROM pg_settings WHERE name in
('rds.logical_replication', 'max_replication_slots',
'max_wal_senders', 'max_logical_replication_workers',
'max_worker_processes');
```

## Upgrading Aurora PostgreSQL to a new major version

###### To prepare the publisher (blue)

1. In the example that follows, the source writer instance (blue) is an
    Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster running PostgreSQL version 11.15. This is the
    publication node in our replication scenario. For this demonstration, our source
    writer instance hosts a sample table that holds a series of values:

```sql

CREATE TABLE my_table (a int PRIMARY KEY);
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES (generate_series(1,100));
```

2. To create a publication on the source instance, connect to the writer node
    of the instance with psql (the CLI for PostgreSQL) or with the client of your
    choice). Enter the following command in each database:

```sql

CREATE PUBLICATION publication_name FOR ALL TABLES;
```

The publication\_name specifies the name of the publication.

3. You also need to create a replication slot on the instance. The following
    command creates a replication slot and loads the `pgoutput` [logical decoding plug-in](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logicaldecoding-explanation.html). The plug-in changes content read from
    write-ahead logging (WAL) to the logical replication protocol, and filters the
    data according to the publication specification.

```sql

SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('replication_slot_name', 'pgoutput');
```

###### To clone the publisher

1. Use the Amazon RDS Console to create a clone of the source instance. Highlight
    the instance name in the Amazon RDS Console, and then choose **Create**
**clone** in the **Actions** menu.

2. Provide a unique name for the instance. Most of the settings are defaults
    from the source instance. When you’ve made changes required for the new
    instance, choose **Create clone**.

![In-place upgrade of an Aurora MySQL DB cluster from version 2 to version 3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/apg-logicalreplication-mvu-create-clone-note.png)

3. While the target instance is initiating, the **Status**
    column of the writer node displays Creating in the **Status**
    column. When the instance is ready, the status changes to Available.

###### To prepare the clone for an upgrade

1. The clone is the ‘green’ instance in the deployment model. It is the host
    of the replication subscription node. When the node becomes available, connect
    with psql and query the new writer node to obtain the log sequence number (LSN).
    The LSN identifies the beginning of a record in the WAL stream.

```sql

SELECT aurora_volume_logical_start_lsn();
```

2. In the response from the query, you find the LSN number. You need this
    number later in the process, so make a note of it.

```sql

postgres=> SELECT aurora_volume_logical_start_lsn();
aurora_volume_logical_start_lsn
   ---------------
0/402E2F0
(1 row)

```

3. Before upgrading the clone, drop the clone's replication slot.

```sql

SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('replication_slot_name');
```

###### To upgrade the cluster to a new major version

- After cloning the provider node, use the Amazon RDS Console to initiate
a major version upgrade on the subscription node. Highlight the instance name in
the RDS console, and select the **Modify** button. Select the
updated version and your updated parameter groups, and apply the settings
immediately to upgrade the target instance.

![In-place upgrade of an Aurora MySQL DB cluster from version 2 to version 3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/apg-logicalreplication-mvu-modify-DB-cluster.png)

- You can also use the CLI to perform an upgrade:

```sql

aws rds modify-db-cluster —db-cluster-identifier $TARGET_Aurora_ID —engine-version 13.6 —allow-major-version-upgrade —apply-immediately
```

###### To prepare the subscriber (green)

1. When the clone becomes available after the upgrade, connect with psql and define the subscription.
    To do so, you need to specify the following options in the `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION` command:

- `subscription_name` – The name of the
subscription.

- `admin_user_name` – The name of an
administrative user with rds\_superuser permissions.

- `admin_user_password` – The password associated with the administrative user.

- `source_instance_URL` – The URL of the publication server instance.

- `database` – The database that the subscription server will connect with.

- `publication_name` – The name of the publication server.

- `replication_slot_name` – The name of the replication slot.

```sql

CREATE SUBSCRIPTION subscription_name
CONNECTION 'postgres://admin_user_name:admin_user_password@source_instance_URL/database' PUBLICATION publication_name
WITH (copy_data = false, create_slot = false, enabled = false, connect = true, slot_name = 'replication_slot_name');
```

2. After creating the subscription, query the [pg\_replication\_origin](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/catalog-pg-replication-origin.html) view to retrieve the roname value, which is
    the identifier of the replication origin. Each instance has one
    `roname`:

```sql

SELECT * FROM pg_replication_origin;
```

For example:

```sql

postgres=>
SELECT * FROM pg_replication_origin;

roident | roname
   ---------+----------
1 | pg_24586

```

3. Provide the LSN that you saved from the earlier query of the publication
    node and the `roname` returned from the subscription node \[INSTANCE\]
    in the command. This command uses the `pg_replication_origin_advance` function to specify the
    starting point in the log sequence for replication.

```sql

SELECT pg_replication_origin_advance('roname', 'log_sequence_number');
```

`roname` is the identifier returned by the
    pg\_replication\_origin view.

`log_sequence_number` is the value returned by the earlier
    query of the `aurora_volume_logical_start_lsn` function.

4. Then, use the `ALTER SUBSCRIPTION... ENABLE` clause to turn on logical replication.

```sql

ALTER SUBSCRIPTION subscription_name ENABLE;
```

5. At this point, you can confirm that replication is working. Add a value to
    the publication instance, then confirm that the value is replicated to the
    subscription node.

Then, use the following command to monitor replication lag on the
    publication node:

```sql

SELECT now() AS CURRENT_TIME, slot_name, active, active_pid, pg_size_pretty(pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(),
confirmed_flush_lsn)) AS diff_size, pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(),
confirmed_flush_lsn) AS diff_bytes FROM pg_replication_slots WHERE slot_type = 'logical';
```

For example:

```sql

postgres=> SELECT now() AS CURRENT_TIME, slot_name, active, active_pid, pg_size_pretty(pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(),
confirmed_flush_lsn)) AS diff_size, pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), confirmed_flush_lsn) AS diff_bytes FROM pg_replication_slots WHERE slot_type = 'logical';

current_time                   | slot_name             | active | active_pid | diff_size | diff_bytes
   -------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+------------+-----------+------------
2022-04-13 15:11:00.243401+00  | replication_slot_name | t      | 21854      | 136 bytes | 136
(1 row)

```

You can monitor the replication lag using `diff_size` and `diff_bytes` values. When these values reach 0, the replica has caught up to the source DB instance.

## Performing post-upgrade tasks

When the upgrade is complete, the instance status displays as **Available** in the
**Status** column of the console dashboard. On the new instance, we
recommend you do the following:

- Redirect your applications to point to the writer node.

- Add reader nodes to manage the caseload and provide high-availability in the
event of an issue with the writer node.

- Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters occasionally require operating system updates. These updates might include a newer version of glibc library.
During such updates, we recommend you to follow the guidelines as described in [Collations supported in Aurora PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/PostgreSQL-Collations.html).

- Update user permissions on the new instance to ensure access.

After testing your application and data on the new instance, we recommend that you
make a final backup of your initial instance before removing it. For more information
about using logical replication on an Aurora host, see [Setting up logical replication for your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.Replication.Logical.Configure.html).
