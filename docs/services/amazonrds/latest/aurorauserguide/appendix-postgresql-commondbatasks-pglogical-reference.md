# Parameter reference for the pglogical extension

In the table you can find parameters associated with the `pglogical` extension.
Parameters such as `pglogical.conflict_log_level` and
`pglogical.conflict_resolution` are used to handle update conflicts. Conflicts
can emerge when changes are made locally to the same tables that are subscribed to changes
from the publisher. Conflicts can also occur during various scenarios, such as two-way
replication or when multiple subscribers are replicating from the same publisher. For more
information, see [PostgreSQL bi-directional replication using pglogical](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/postgresql-bi-directional-replication-using-pglogical).
