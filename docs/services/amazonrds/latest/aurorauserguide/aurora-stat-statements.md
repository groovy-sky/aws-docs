# aurora\_stat\_statements

Displays all `pg_stat_statements` columns and adds more columns in the end.

## Syntax

```nohighlight

aurora_stat_statements(showtext boolean)
```

## Arguments

_showtext boolean_

## Return type

SETOF record with all `pg_stat_statements` columns and the following
additional columns. For more information on `pg_stat_statements` columns,
see [`pg_stat_statements`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html).

You can reset stats for this function using
`pg_stat_statements_reset()`.

- `storage_blks_read` – Total number of shared blocks read
from aurora storage by this statement.

- `orcache_blks_hit` – Total number of optimized reads
cache hits by this statement.

- `storage_blk_read_time` – If
`track_io_timing` is enabled, it tracks the total time the
statement spent reading shared blocks from aurora storage, in milliseconds,
otherwise the value is zero. For more information, see [track\_io\_timing](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-statistics.html).

- `local_blk_read_time` – If `track_io_timing`
is enabled, it tracks the total time the statement spent reading local
blocks, in milliseconds, otherwise the value is zero. For more information,
see [track\_io\_timing](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-statistics.html).

- `orcache_blk_read_time` – If
`track_io_timing` is enabled, it tracks the total time the
statement spent reading shared blocks from optimized reads cache, in
milliseconds, otherwise the value is zero. For more information, see [track\_io\_timing](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-statistics.html).

- `total_plan_peakmem` – Total sum of peak memory values
during planning phase for all calls to this statement. To see the average
peak memory during planning for the statement, divide this value by the
number of calls.

- `min_plan_peakmem` – Smallest peak memory value seen
during planning across all calls to this statement.

- `max_plan_peakmem` – Largest peak memory value during
planning seen across all calls to this statement.

- `total_exec_peakmem` – Total sum of peak memory values
during execution phase for all calls to this statement. To see the average
peak memory during execution for the statement, divide this value by the
number of calls.

- `min_exec_peakmem` –Smallest peak memory value, in
bytes, seen during execution across all calls to this statement.

- `max_exec_peakmem` – Largest peak memory value, in
bytes, seen during execution across all calls to this statement.

###### Note

`total_plan_peakmen`, `min_plan_peakmem`, and
`max_plan_peakmem` are only monitored when the setting
`pg_stat_statements.track_planning` is turned on.

## Usage notes

To use the aurora\_stat\_statements() function, you must include
`pg_stat_statements` extension in the
`shared_preload_libraries` parameter.

This function is available in the following Aurora PostgreSQL versions:

- 15.4 and higher 15 versions

- 14.9 and higher 14 versions

The columns showing peak memory are available from the following versions:

- 16.3 and higher versions

- 15.7 and higher versions

- 14.12 and higher versions

## Examples

The following example shows how it carries all the pg\_stat\_statements columns and
append 11 new columns in the end:
