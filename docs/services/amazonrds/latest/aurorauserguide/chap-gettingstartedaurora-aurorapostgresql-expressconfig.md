# Create with express configuration

You can create and connect to an Aurora PostgreSQL serverless database in seconds using
express configuration which provides a streamlined database creation experience with
preconfigured defaults to help you get started easily and quickly.

In two clicks, you can have an Aurora cluster with a serverless instance ready to use
in seconds. You can also use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or [AWS SDKs](../../../../reference/sdkref/latest/guide/overview.md) with
the parameter `--express-configuration` to create both a cluster and an
instance within the cluster with single API call which makes it ready for running queries
in seconds. You have the flexibility to modify most of the settings during, and most
other settings after the database creation. For more information about these settings,
see [Express configuration settings](#CHAP_GettingStartedAurora.AuroraPostgreSQL.ExpressConfig.Settings). Once created, you have access to most of the
features and benefits of Aurora such as the ability to add readers for high availability
and scalability, and automatic failover capabilities. Some options, such as specifying a
customer managed encryption key, selecting specific engine versions, or associating the
clusters with an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), are only available when using the
[Create with full configuration](chap-gettingstartedaurora-aurorapostgresql-fullconfig.md) option. This creation experience for Aurora PostgreSQL is also available with the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/free).

## Prerequisites

Before you can create an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster with express configuration, you must at minimum have the following permissions:

- `ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones`

- `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`

- `rds:CreateDBCluster`

- `rds:CreateDBInstance`

- `rds:EnableInternetAccessGateway`

## Supported Regions

You can create an Aurora PostgreSQL serverless cluster with express configuration in all AWS Regions except the AWS China, AWS GovCloud (US), Middle East (UAE), and Middle East (Bahrain) Regions.

## Internet access gateway

Aurora also provides an internet access gateway enabled by default to connect securely with the clusters created through express configuration. This feature is currently supported only for express configuration clusters. It supports the PostgreSQL wire protocol and enables you to connect through the internet from a wide range of tools and development platforms that may be running outside of you AWS infrastructure - no VPN or AWS Direct Connect required. The gateway is distributed across multiple Availability Zones, offering the same level of high availability as your Aurora cluster. It is a managed component of Aurora, so there are no software updates or patches that need to be applied by you.

The internet access gateway is integrated with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), allowing you to enforce identity-based permissions for authorized access and safeguard your data with ephemeral token-based access. When using the gateway, the required setup for the database administrator user, including granting the rds\_iam role, is automatically managed for you.

## Creating a DB cluster with express configuration

You can create an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster with express configuration using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

### Console

To create with express configuration using the console:

###### To create with express configuration using the console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the upper-right corner of the AWS Management Console, choose the AWS Region in which you want to create the DB cluster.

3. In the navigation pane, choose Databases.

4. On the Welcome to Aurora and RDS page, locate the Create with express configuration in seconds section on the left side, and choose Create.

![The Welcome to Aurora and RDS page showing the Create with express configuration section.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-express-config-image1.png)

5. Review pre-configured settings in the Create with express configuration dialog.

![The Create with express configuration dialog showing pre-configured settings.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-express-config-image2.png)

6. (Optional) Modify the DB cluster identifier or the capacity range as per your need.

7. Choose Create database.

8. Your Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless database should be ready in seconds. A success banner confirms the creation, and the database status changes to "Available".

![The database status showing Available after successful creation.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-express-config-image3.png)

### CLI

You can use the AWS CLI to create an Aurora PostgreSQL clusters with express configuration.

For Linux or MacOS.

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier sample-express-cluster \
    --engine aurora-postgresql \
    --with-express-configuration
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier sample-express-cluster ^
    --engine aurora-postgresql ^
    --with-express-configuration
```

The express configuration parameter takes care of creating a database cluster, an Aurora serverless instance, setting up the internet access gateway, and IAM authentication for the admin database user (default = postgres).

### API

You can use the relevant AWS SDK and call the CreateDBCluster operation to create a DB cluster and database instance with the express configuration.

## Connecting to clusters with express configuration

Clusters created with express configuration are automatically set up with an internet access gateway, which provides public access to your database with IAM authentication. Ensure that the IAM identity you use to connect to the database has permissions to rds-db:connect to generate the authentication token needed to access the database. To learn more, see [IAM database authentication](usingwithrds-iamdbauth.md).

The following guide demonstrates how to use the various options in the "Connectivity & Security" tab in the AWS Management Console to connect to your database.

The RDS Console surfaces relevant information such as code snippets, endpoint details, and other connection details to help you connect to the database. It also offers a utility to generate a token and direct access through AWS CloudShell. Both the generate token utility and CloudShell connect using the master username you set up at the time of database creation.

### Using the Connectivity & security tab

After your database is created, navigate to the Connectivity & security tab to access connection options. The Connect to database section provides three methods for connecting:

#### Code snippets

Use when connecting through SDK, APIs, or third-party tools. The console provides ready-to-use code snippets for your selected programming language. The snippets also dynamically reflect the authentication configuration for your database.

The following steps show connecting to your database cluster using the psql command line utility code snippet.

**Prerequisites**

- You can connect to Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters by using tools like psql, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal. To install psql and learn more about using the PostgreSQL interactive terminal, see psql in the PostgreSQL documentation.

- You must have the latest version of the AWS CLI installed. To install or update the AWS CLI, see [Installing or updating to the latest version of the AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.md).

**Connecting with psql**

###### To connect with psql

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Navigate to your database cluster from the Databases list tab.

3. Under the connectivity & Security tab, select the PSQL code snippet for your respective operating system (macOS, linux, or Windows).

4. Copy the code shown in connection steps modal.

![The connection steps modal showing the PSQL code snippet.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-express-config-image4.png)

5. Open a terminal on your local development environment / machine.

6. (optional) If you have already configured the AWS CLI and credentials, you can skip this step. Otherwise, use the following command for a temporary login session.

```nohighlight

aws login
```

7. Paste the command you copied in step 4. You should see psql login and the “postgres =>” prompt, enabling you to run SQL commands.

#### CloudShell

The console provides an automated way to connect to your cluster using AWS CloudShell. The following guide shows the steps to connect using psql and CloudShell.

**Prerequisites**

None

**Using CloudShell and PSQL**

###### To connect using CloudShell and PSQL

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Navigate to your database cluster from the Databases list tab.

3. Under the connectivity & Security tab, select CloudShell.

4. Click Launch Cloudshell

![The CloudShell launch button in the connectivity and security tab.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-express-config-image5.png)

5. Click Run on prompt window. The command is pre-prepopulated with relevant information to connect to your specific cluster.

![The CloudShell prompt window with pre-populated connection command.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-express-config-image6.png)

6. You should see psql login and the “postgres =>” prompt, enabling you to run SQL commands.

![The psql login prompt in CloudShell showing successful connection.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-express-config-image7.png)

Use for quick access to AWS CLI that launches directly from the AWS Management Console. CloudShell provides a browser-based shell environment with pre-authenticated AWS CLI access.

#### Endpoints with Get token utility

If you are using tools that only support using username and password credentials, you can use the Get token utility to connect. In this case, you use the token generated by the utility in the password field. The token is generated for the master username that you setup at the time of creating the database. The token is valid for 15 minutes at a time. If the tool you are using terminates the connection, you would need to generate the token again.

The following steps show, how to use the Get token utility to connect to your database cluster using pgAdmin.

**Prerequisites**

- You can use the pgAdmin utility to connect to Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters by using a UI interface. For more information, see the [Download](https://www.pgadmin.org/download) page from the pgAdmin website.

**Connecting to pgAdmin**

###### To connect using pgAdmin

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Navigate to your database cluster from the Databases list tab.

3. Under the connectivity & Security tab, select the “Endpoints” tab.

![The Endpoints tab showing writer endpoint, port, and database details.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-express-config-image8.png)

4. Copy the relevant information, including the writer endpoint, port, master username, and database name.

5. Generate and copy a new token (short lived password) from the Get token utility.

![The Get token utility for generating an authentication token.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-express-config-image9.png)

6. Open pgAdmin on your machine, and “Add a new server”. Enter the details in the Connection tab. Use the token in the password field.

![The pgAdmin connection dialog with server details.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-express-config-image10.png)

The connection panel displays: internet access gateway status (Enabled), IAM Authentication status (Enabled), and IAM authentication token option. Select your programming language from the dropdown and follow the connection steps to paste the code and run the commands.

## Restoring a cluster created through express configuration

The restore process for express configuration clusters follows the same workflow as standard clusters. You can restore from a manual snapshot using the [restore-db-cluster-from-snapshot](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-cluster-from-snapshot.md) operation or restore to a specific point in time using the [restore-db-cluster-to-point-in-time](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-cluster-to-point-in-time.md) operation. You can restore a cluster with express configuration to either a cluster with full configuration or a cluster with express configuration. If you want to restore to a cluster with express configuration, both restore operations require two additional parameters—VPCNetworkingEnabled must be set to false and InternetAccessGatewayEnabled must be set to true. If you're restoring a regular cluster that used master username and password authentication to an express configuration cluster, you'll need to modify the restored DB cluster to update MasterUserAuthenticationType to iam-db-auth.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply to clusters created with express configuration and the internet access gateway that is enabled by default.

- You can only use express configuration with Aurora PostgreSQL only.

- Cluster created with express configuration are encrypted with AWS/RDS service managed key. You cannot use a custom AWS KMS key to encrypt the database.

- You cannot associate express clusters with an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). When connecting from a machine that is inside a VPC to the database with the express cluster with internet access gateway enabled, ensure that the machine allows inbound and outbound traffic from the internet.

- You cannot disable the internet access gateway for clusters created with express configuration.

- You can only use RDS IAM authentication with the internet access gateway. See, [IAM database authentication](usingwithrds-iamdbauth.md) for list of limitations and recommendation. Features related to other forms of authentication such as managed credentials in AWS Secrets Manager, and Kerberos authentication cannot be used with clusters that have internet access gateway enabled. You also cannot disable IAM authentication.

###### Warning

If you disable the `rds_iam` role for the master username, you will lose access to new connections to the database. You can restore access by modifying the cluster and setting the `--master-user-authentication-type` to `iam-db-auth`. See, [modify-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster.md).

- You cannot select a specific engine version with express configuration. Engine version can be upgraded but not downgraded.

- Clusters with express configuration only support creating an Aurora Serverless v2 instance. You can modify the instance type or add instances after the database is created.

- Clusters with express configuration only support the default parameter group. The parameter group can be updated after the database is created.

- The following features are not supported with clusters created with express configuration as they are not associated with a VPC.

- Aurora limitless database

- Aurora global database

- RDS Proxy

- Aurora Zero-ETL integration

- RDS Query Editor

- Blue/Green Deployments

- Database Activity Streams

- Zero Downtime Patching

- Babelfish

- Data API can be enabled for a cluster with express configuration after creation using the ModifyDBCluster operation. However, it doesn't support authentication with master username/password. You must create new user credentials to access Data API.

- Database Insights Advanced mode can be enabled on a cluster with express configuration after creation using the ModifyDBCluster operation.

- Clusters with express configuration support IPv4 addresses only. IPv6 is not supported.

- Clusters with express configuration does not support changing all settings at the time of create operations. For example, you can only choose Aurora standard storage when creating with express configuration. You can change the storage type after the cluster is created. See, Express configuration settings for a list of all other settings and default values that apply with express configuration.

- Clusters created through express configuration with internet access gateway enabled do not support configurable cipher suites. Although Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL allows you to configure the ssl\_ciphers parameter to restrict allowed SSL cipher suites, this parameter is ignored on clusters with internet access gateway enabled, which use the default cipher suite configuration instead.
