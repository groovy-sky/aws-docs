# Troubleshooting snapshot exports

Use the following sections to help troubleshoot failure messages and PostgreSQL permission errors for DB cluster export tasks to Amazon S3.

## Failure messages for Amazon S3 export tasks

The following table describes the messages that are returned when Amazon S3 export tasks fail.

Failure messageDescription**`An unknown internal error occurred.`**

The task has failed because of an unknown error, exception, or failure.

**`An unknown internal error occurred writing the export task's metadata to the S3 bucket**
**[bucket name].`**

The task has failed because of an unknown error, exception, or failure.

**`The RDS export failed to write the export task's metadata because it can't assume the**
**IAM role [role ARN].`**

The export task assumes your IAM role to validate whether it is allowed to write metadata to your S3
bucket. If the task can't assume your IAM role, it fails.

**`The RDS export failed to write the export task's metadata to the S3 bucket [bucket name]**
**using the IAM role [role ARN] with the KMS key [key ID]. Error code: [error code]`**

One or more permissions are missing, so the export task can't
access the S3 bucket. This failure message is raised when receiving
one of the following error codes:

- `AWSSecurityTokenServiceException` with the error code `AccessDenied`

- `AmazonS3Exception` with the error code `NoSuchBucket`,
`AccessDenied`, `KMS.KMSInvalidStateException`, `403
  	                                        Forbidden`, or `KMS.DisabledException`

These error codes indicate that settings are misconfigured for the
IAM role, S3 bucket, or KMS key.

**`The IAM role [role ARN] isn't authorized to call [S3 action] on the S3 bucket [bucket name].**
**Review your permissions and retry the export.`**

The IAM policy is misconfigured. Permission for the specific S3
action on the S3 bucket is missing, which causes the export task to
fail.

**`KMS key check failed. Check the credentials on your KMS key and try again.`**The KMS key credential check failed.**`S3 credential check failed. Check the permissions on your S3 bucket and IAM**
**policy.`**The S3 credential check failed.**`The S3 bucket [bucket name] isn't valid. Either it isn't located in the current**
**AWS Region or it doesn't exist. Review your S3 bucket name and retry the export.`**The S3 bucket is invalid.**`The S3 bucket [bucket name] isn't located in the current AWS Region. Review your S3 bucket**
**name and retry the export.`**The S3 bucket is in the wrong AWS Region.

## Troubleshooting PostgreSQL permissions errors

When exporting PostgreSQL databases to Amazon S3, you might see a `PERMISSIONS_DO_NOT_EXIST` error stating that certain tables
were skipped. This error usually occurs when the superuser, which you specified when creating the DB instance, doesn't have
permissions to access those tables.

To fix this error, run the following command:

```nohighlight

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA schema_name TO superuser_name
```

For more information on superuser privileges, see [Master user account privileges](usingwithrds-masteraccounts.md).
