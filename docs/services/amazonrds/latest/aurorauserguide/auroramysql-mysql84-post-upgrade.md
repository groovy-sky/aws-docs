# Post-upgrade cleanup for Aurora MySQL version 8.4

After you finish upgrading your Aurora MySQL version 3 cluster to version 8.4, perform the following cleanup actions:

- **Migrate users to caching\_sha2\_password.** The default
`authentication_policy` is `*:caching_sha2_password` in Aurora MySQL version 8.4.
We recommend migrating any remaining users from `mysql_native_password` to
`caching_sha2_password` before the upgrade is complete.

- **Update monitoring and automation.** Update any CloudWatch alarms, setup scripts,
and automation that use removed replication status variables (such as `Com_show_slave_status` or
`Com_slave_start`). Use the replacement status variables instead.

- **Update CloudFormation templates.** Update any CloudFormation templates to remove references to
removed parameters and use the replacement parameters.
