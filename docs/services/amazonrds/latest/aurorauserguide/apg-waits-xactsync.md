# IO:XactSync

The `IO:XactSync` event occurs when the database is waiting for the Aurora
storage subsystem to acknowledge the commit of a regular transaction, or the commit or
rollback of a prepared transaction. A prepared transaction is part of PostgreSQL's
support for a two-phase commit. This event can also occur when a query is waiting for
another transaction to commit, particularly in cases where auto-commit is turned off. In
such scenarios, updates might appear to be waiting on XactSync even though they haven't been
committed yet.

## Supported engine versions

This wait event information is supported for all versions of Aurora PostgreSQL.

## Context

The event `IO:XactSync` indicates that the instance is spending time waiting for the Aurora storage subsystem to confirm that transaction data was processed.

## Likely causes of increased waits

When the `IO:XactSync` event appears more than normal, possibly indicating a performance problem, typical causes include the following:

**Network saturation**

Traffic between clients and the DB instance or traffic to the
storage subsystem might be too heavy for the network bandwidth.

**CPU pressure**

A heavy workload might be preventing the Aurora storage daemon from getting sufficient CPU time.

## Actions

We recommend different actions depending on the causes of your wait event.

- [Increase network bandwidth](#apg-waits.xactsync.actions.scalenetwork)

- [Reduce the number of commits](#apg-waits.xactsync.actions.commits)

### Monitor your resources

To determine the cause of the increased `IO:XactSync` events, check the following metrics:

- `WriteThroughput` and `CommitThroughput` – Changes in write
throughput or commit throughput can show an increase in workload.

- `WriteLatency` and `CommitLatency` – Changes in write latency or
commit latency can show that the storage subsystem is being asked to do more
work.

- `CPUUtilization` – If the instance's CPU utilization is above 90
percent, the Aurora storage daemon might not be getting sufficient time on
the CPU. In this case, I/O performance degrades.

For information about these metrics, see [Instance-level metrics for Amazon Aurora](aurora-auroramonitoring-metrics.md#Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Monitoring.Metrics.instances).

### Scale up the CPU

To address CPU starvation issues, consider changing to an instance type with more CPU capacity. For information about CPU capacity for a DB instance class, see [Hardware specifications for DB instance classesfor Aurora](concepts-dbinstanceclass-summary.md).

### Increase network bandwidth

To determine whether the instance is reaching its network bandwidth limits, check for the following other wait events:

- `IO:DataFileRead`, `IO:BufferRead`, `IO:BufferWrite`, and `IO:XactWrite` – Queries using large amounts of I/O can generate more of these wait events.

- `Client:ClientRead` and `Client:ClientWrite` – Queries with large amounts of client communication can generate more of these wait events.

If network bandwidth is an issue, consider changing to an instance type with more network bandwidth. For information about network performance for a DB instance class, see [Hardware specifications for DB instance classesfor Aurora](concepts-dbinstanceclass-summary.md).

### Reduce the number of commits

To reduce the number of commits, combine statements into transaction blocks.
