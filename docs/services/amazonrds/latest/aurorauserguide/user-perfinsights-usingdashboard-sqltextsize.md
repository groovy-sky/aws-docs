# Accessing more SQL text in the Performance Insights dashboard

By default, each row in the **Top SQL** table shows 500 bytes of SQL text for each SQL statement.

![500 bytes of SQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/perf-insights-top-sql-bytes.png)

When a SQL statement exceeds 500 bytes, you can view more text in the **SQL text** section below the **Top**
**SQL** table. In this case, the maximum length for the text displayed in **SQL text** is 4 KB. This limit is
introduced by the console and is subject to the limits set by the database engine. To save the text shown in **SQL text**,
choose **Download**.

## Text size limits for Aurora MySQL

When you download SQL text, the database engine determines its maximum length. You can download SQL text up to the following per-engine
limits.

DB engineMaximum length of downloaded textAurora MySQL

The length is fixed at 4,096 bytes.

The **SQL text** section of the Performance Insights console displays up to the maximum that the engine returns. For example,
if Aurora MySQL returns at most 1 KB to Performance Insights, it can only collect and show 1 KB, even
if the original query is larger. Thus, when you view the query in **SQL text** or download it, Performance Insights
returns the same number of bytes.

If you use the AWS CLI or API, Performance Insights doesn't have the 4 KB limit enforced by the console.
`DescribeDimensionKeys` and `GetResourceMetrics` return at most 500 bytes.

###### Note

`GetDimensionKeyDetails` returns the full query, but the size is subject to the engine limit.
