# Creating and connecting to an Aurora MySQL DB cluster

This tutorial creates an EC2 instance and an Aurora MySQL DB cluster. The tutorial shows you how to access the DB
cluster from the EC2 instance using a standard MySQL client. As a best practice, this
tutorial creates a private DB cluster in a virtual private cloud (VPC). In most cases,
other resources in the same VPC, such as EC2 instances, can access the DB cluster, but resources
outside of the VPC can't access it.

After you complete the tutorial, there is a public and private subnet in each
Availability Zone in your VPC. In one Availability Zone, the EC2 instance is in the
public subnet, and the DB instance is in the private subnet.

###### Important

There's no charge for creating an AWS account. However, by completing this tutorial, you
might incur costs for the AWS resources that you use. You can delete these
resources after you complete the tutorial if they are no longer needed.

The following diagram shows the configuration when the tutorial is complete.

![EC2 instance and Aurora MySQL DB cluster.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/getting-started-aurora-mysql.png)

This tutorial allows you to create your resources by using one of the following methods:

1. Use the AWS Management Console ‐
    [Step 1: Create an EC2 instance](#CHAP_GettingStarted.Creating.AuroraMySQL.EC2) and
    [Step 2: Create an Aurora MySQL DB cluster](#CHAP_GettingStarted.Aurora.CreateDBCluster)

2. Use CloudFormation to create the database instance and EC2 instance ‐
    [(Optional) Create VPC, EC2 instance, and Aurora MySQL cluster using CloudFormation](#CHAP_GettingStartedAurora.CFN.MySQL)

The first method uses **Easy create** to create a private Aurora MySQL DB cluster with the AWS Management Console.
Here, you specify only the DB engine type, DB instance size, and DB cluster identifier.
**Easy create** uses the default settings for the other configuration options.

When you use **Standard create** instead, you can specify more configuration options when you create a DB cluster.
These options include settings for availability, security, backups, and maintenance.
To create a public DB cluster, you must use **Standard create**. For information, see [Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-createinstance.md).

- [Create a user with administrative access](chap-settingup-aurora.md#create-an-admin)

## Step 1: Create an EC2 instance

Create an Amazon EC2 instance that you will use to connect to your database.

###### To create an EC2 instance

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the upper-right corner of the AWS Management Console, choose the AWS Region in which you
    want to create the EC2 instance.

3. Choose **EC2 Dashboard**, and then choose **Launch**
**instance**, as shown in the following image.

![EC2 Dashboard.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/Tutorial_WebServer_11.png)

The **Launch an instance** page opens.

4. Choose the following settings on the **Launch an instance**
    page.
1. Under **Name and tags**, for **Name**, enter
       `ec2-database-connect`.

2. Under **Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine**
      **Image)**, choose **Amazon Linux**, and then choose the
       **Amazon Linux 2023 AMI**. Keep the default selections for the
       other choices.

      ![Choose an Amazon Machine Image.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/Tutorial_WebServer_12.png)

3. Under **Instance type**, choose **t2.micro**.

4. Under **Key pair (login)**, choose a **Key pair name** to use an existing key
       pair. To create a new key pair for the Amazon EC2 instance, choose **Create new key pair**
       and then use the **Create key pair** window to create it.

      For more information about creating a new key pair, see [Create a key pair](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.md#create-a-key-pair)
       in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

5. For **Allow SSH traffic** in **Network**
      **settings**, choose the source of SSH connections to the EC2
       instance.

      You can choose **My IP** if the displayed IP address is
       correct for SSH connections. Otherwise, you can determine the IP address to
       use to connect to EC2 instances in your VPC using Secure Shell (SSH). To
       determine your public IP address, in a different browser window or tab, you
       can use the service at [https://checkip.amazonaws.com](https://checkip.amazonaws.com/). An example of an IP address is
       192.0.2.1/32.

       In many cases, you might connect through an
       internet service provider (ISP) or from behind your firewall without a
       static IP address. If so, make sure to determine the range of IP addresses
       used by client computers.

      ###### Warning

      If you use `0.0.0.0/0` for SSH access, you make it possible
      for all IP addresses to access your public EC2 instances using SSH. This
      approach is acceptable for a short time in a test environment, but it's
      unsafe for production environments. In production, authorize only a
      specific IP address or range of addresses to access your EC2 instances
      using SSH.

      The following image shows an example of the **Network settings**
       section.

      ![Network settings for an EC2 instance.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/EC2_RDS_Connect_NtwkSettings.png)

6. Leave the default values for the remaining sections.

7. Review a summary of your EC2 instance configuration in the **Summary** panel, and when you're ready,
       choose **Launch instance**.
5. On the **Launch Status** page, note the identifier for your new
    EC2 instance, for example: `i-1234567890abcdef0`.

![EC2 instance identifier on Launch Status page.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/getting-started-ec2-id.png)

6. Choose the EC2 instance identifier to open the list of EC2 instances, and then
    select your EC2 instance.

7. In the **Details** tab, note the following values, which you
    need when you connect using SSH:
1. In **Instance summary**, note the value for
       **Public IPv4 DNS**.

      ![EC2 public DNS name on Details tab of Instances page.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/easy-create-ec2-public-dns.png)

2. In **Instance details**, note the value for **Key**
      **pair name**.

      ![EC2 key pair name on Details tab of Instance page.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/easy-create-ec2-key-pair.png)
8. Wait until the **Instance state** for your EC2 instance has a status
    of **Running** before continuing.

## Step 2: Create an Aurora MySQL DB cluster

In this example, you use **Easy create** to create an Aurora MySQL DB cluster
with a db.r6g.large DB instance class.

###### To create an Aurora MySQL DB cluster with Easy create

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

02. In the upper-right corner of the Amazon RDS console, choose the AWS Region in which you want to
     create the DB cluster.

03. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

04. Choose **Create database** and make sure that **Easy**
    **create** is chosen.

    ![Easy create option.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/easy-create-option.png)

05. In **Configuration**, choose **Aurora (MySQL Compatible)** for
     **Engine type**.

06. For **DB instance size**, choose **Dev/Test**.

07. For **DB cluster identifier**, enter `database-test1`.

    The **Create database** page should look similar to the following image.

    ![Create database page.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/easy-create-aurora-mysql.png)

08. For **Master username**, enter a name for the master user, or keep the
     default name.

09. To use an automatically generated master password for the DB cluster, select
     **Auto generate a password**.

    To enter your master password, make sure that **Auto generate a**
    **password** is cleared, and then enter the same password in
     **Master password** and **Confirm**
    **password**.

10. To set up a connection with the EC2 instance you created previously, open
     **Set up EC2 connection -**
    **_optional_**.

    Select **Connect to an EC2 compute resource**. Choose the
     EC2 instance you created previously.

    ![Set up EC2 connection option.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/EC2_RDS_Setup_Conn-EasyCreate.png)

11. Open **View default settings for Easy create**.

    ![Easy create default settings.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/easy-create-view-default-settings.png)

    You can examine the default settings used with **Easy create**. The
     **Editable after database is created** column shows which
     options you can change after you create the database.

- If a setting has **No** in that column, and you want
a different setting, you can use **Standard create** to
create the DB cluster.

- If a setting has **Yes** in that column, and you want a different
setting, you can either use **Standard create** to
create the DB cluster, or modify the DB cluster after you create it to
change the setting.

12. Choose **Create database**.

    To view the master username and password for the DB cluster, choose
     **View credential details**.

    You can use the username and password that appears to connect to the DB
     cluster as the master user.

    ###### Important

    You can't view the master user password again. If you don't
    record it, you might have to change it.

    If you need to change the master user password after the DB cluster
    is available, you can modify the DB cluster to do so. For more
    information about modifying a DB cluster, see [Modifying an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-modifying.md).

13. In the **Databases** list, choose the name of the new Aurora MySQL
     DB cluster to show its details.

    The writer instance has a status of **Creating** until the
     DB cluster is ready to use.

    ![DB cluster details.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/creating-status-aurora-mysql.png)

    When the status of the writer instance changes to **Available**, you can
     connect to the DB cluster. Depending on the DB instance class and the amount
     of storage, it can take up to 20 minutes before the new DB cluster is
     available.

## (Optional) Create VPC, EC2 instance, and Aurora MySQL cluster using CloudFormation

Instead of using the console to create your VPC, EC2 instance, and Aurora MySQL DB cluster, you can use CloudFormation to provision AWS resources by treating infrastructure as code.
To help you organize your AWS resources into smaller and more manageable units, you can use the CloudFormation nested stack functionality.
For more information, see [Creating a stack on the CloudFormation console](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/cfn-console-create-stack.md) and
[Working with nested stacks](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.md).

###### Important

CloudFormation is free, but the resources that CloudFormation creates are live. You incur the standard
usage fees for these resources until you terminate them. For more information,
see [Amazon Aurora\
Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/pricing).

To create your resources using the CloudFormation console, complete the following steps:

- Step 1: Download the CloudFormation template

- Step 2: Configure your resources using CloudFormation

### Download the CloudFormation template

A CloudFormation template is a JSON or YAML text file that contains the configuration information about the resources you want to create in the stack.
This template also creates a VPC and a bastion host for you along with the Aurora cluster.

To download the template file, open the following link, [Aurora MySQL CloudFormation template](https://github.com/aws-ia/cfn-ps-amazon-aurora-mysql/blob/main/templates/aurora_mysql-main.template.yaml).

In the Github page, click the _Download raw file_ button to save the template YAML file.

### Configure your resources using CloudFormation

###### Note

Before starting this process, make sure you have a Key pair for an EC2 instance in your AWS account. For more information,
see [Amazon EC2 key pairs and Linux instances](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-key-pairs.md).

When you use the CloudFormation template, you must select the correct parameters to make sure your resources are created properly.
Follow the steps below:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. Choose **Create Stack**.

3. In the Specify template section, select **Upload a template file from your computer**, and then choose **Next**.

4. In the **Specify stack details** page, set the following parameters:

01. Set **Stack name** to **AurMySQLTestStack**.

02. Under **Parameters**, set **Availability Zones** by selecting two availability zones.

03. Under **Linux Bastion Host configuration**, for **Key Name**, select a key pair to login to your EC2 instance.

04. In **Linux Bastion Host configuration** settings,
     set the **Permitted IP range** to your IP address.
     To connect to EC2 instances in your VPC using Secure Shell (SSH), determine your
     public IP address using the service at
     [https://checkip.amazonaws.com](https://checkip.amazonaws.com/).
     An example of an IP address is 192.0.2.1/32.

    ###### Warning

    If you use `0.0.0.0/0` for SSH access, you make it
    possible for all IP addresses to access your public EC2
    instances using SSH. This approach is acceptable for a short
    time in a test environment, but it's unsafe for production
    environments. In production, authorize only a specific IP
    address or range of addresses to access your EC2 instances using
    SSH.

05. Under **Database General configuration**, set **Database instance class** to **db.r6g.large**.

06. Set **Database name** to `database-test1`.

07. For **Database master username**, enter a name for the master user.

08. Set **Manage DB master user password with Secrets Manager** to `false` for this tutorial.

09. For **Database password**, set a password of your choice. Remember this password for further steps in the tutorial.

10. Set **Multi-AZ deployment** to `false`.

11. Leave all other settings as the default values. Click **Next** to continue.

5. In the **Configure stack options** page, leave all the default options. Click **Next** to continue.

6. In the **Review stack** page, select **Submit** after checking the database and Linux bastion host options.

After the stack creation process completes, view the stacks with names _BastionStack_ and _AMSNS_
to note the information you need to connect to the database. For more information, see
[Viewing CloudFormation stack data and resources on the AWS Management Console](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/cfn-console-view-stack-data-resources.md).

## Step 3: Connect to an Aurora MySQL DB cluster

You can use any standard SQL client application to connect to the DB cluster. In
this example, you connect to the Aurora MySQL DB cluster using the mysql command line
client.

###### To connect to the Aurora MySQL DB cluster

1. Find the endpoint (DNS name) and port number of the writer instance for
    your DB cluster.
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
       [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the upper-right corner of the Amazon RDS console, choose the
       AWS Region for the DB cluster.

3. In the navigation pane, choose
       **Databases**.

4. Choose the Aurora MySQL DB cluster name to display its details.

5. On the **Connectivity & security** tab, copy
       the endpoint of the writer instance. Also, note the port number. You
       need both the endpoint and the port number to connect to the DB
       cluster.

      ![Connect to an Aurora MySQL DB cluster.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/AuroraLaunch04.png)
2. Connect to the EC2 instance that you created earlier by following the
    steps in [Connect to your\
    Linux instance](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/accessinginstances.md) in the
    _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

We recommend that you connect to your EC2 instance using SSH. If the SSH
    client utility is installed on Windows, Linux, or Mac, you can connect to
    the instance using the following command format:

```nohighlight

ssh -i location_of_pem_file ec2-user@ec2-instance-public-dns-name
```

For example, suppose that
    `ec2-database-connect-key-pair.pem` is stored in
    `/dir1` on Linux, and the public IPv4 DNS for your EC2
    instance is `ec2-12-345-678-90.compute-1.amazonaws.com`. Then,
    your SSH command would look as follows:

```nohighlight

ssh -i /dir1/ec2-database-connect-key-pair.pem ec2-user@ec2-12-345-678-90.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

3. Get the latest bug fixes and security updates by updating the software on
    your EC2 instance. To do so, use the following command.

###### Note

The `-y` option installs the updates without asking for
confirmation. To examine updates before installing, omit this
option.

```nohighlight

sudo dnf update -y
```

4. To install the mysql command line client from MariaDB on Amazon Linux 2023, run the
    following command:

```nohighlight

sudo dnf install mariadb105
```

5. Connect to the Aurora MySQL DB cluster. For example, enter the following
    command. This action lets you connect to the Aurora MySQL DB cluster using the
    MySQL client.

Substitute the endpoint of the writer instance for
    `endpoint`, and substitute the
    master username that you used for
    `admin`. Provide the master
    password that you used when prompted for a password.

```nohighlight

mysql -h endpoint -P 3306 -u admin -p
```

After you enter the password for the user, you should see output similar
    to the following.

```nohighlight

Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 217
Server version: 8.0.23 Source distribution

Copyright (c) 2000, 2018, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

MySQL [(none)]>
```

For more information about connecting to an Aurora MySQL DB cluster, see
    [Connecting to an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster](aurora-connecting.md#Aurora.Connecting.AuroraMySQL). If you can't
    connect to your DB cluster, see [Can't connect to Amazon RDS DB instance](chap-troubleshooting.md#CHAP_Troubleshooting.Connecting).

For security, it is a best practice to use encrypted connections. Only use
    an unencrypted MySQL connection when the client and server are in the same
    VPC and the network is trusted. For information about using encrypted
    connections, see [Connecting to Aurora MySQL using SSL](aurora-connecting.md#Aurora.Connecting.SSL).

6. Run SQL commands.

For example, the following SQL command shows the current date and
    time:

```sql

SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

## Step 4: Delete the EC2 instance and DB cluster

After you connect to and explore the sample EC2 instance and DB cluster that you created, delete them so
you're no longer charged for them.

If you used CloudFormation to create resources, skip this step and go to the next step.

###### To delete the EC2 instance

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

3. Select the EC2 instance, and choose **Instance state, Terminate instance**.

4. Choose **Terminate** when prompted for confirmation.

For more information about deleting an EC2 instance, see [Terminate your instance](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/terminating-instances.md)
in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

###### To delete the DB cluster

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose **Databases** and then choose the
    DB instance associated with the DB cluster.

3. For **Actions**, choose
    **Delete**.

4. Clear **Create final snapshot?**.

5. Complete the acknowledgement and choose **Delete**.

After all of the DB instances associated with a DB cluster are deleted, the DB cluster
is deleted automatically.

## (Optional) Delete the EC2 instance and DB cluster created with CloudFormation

If you used CloudFormation to create resources, delete the CloudFormation stack after you connect to and explore the sample EC2 instance and DB cluster, so you're no longer charged for them.

###### To delete the CloudFormation resources

1. Open the CloudFormation console.

2. On the **Stacks** page in the CloudFormation console, select the root stack (the stack without the name VPCStack, BastionStack or AMSNS).

3. Choose **Delete**.

4. Select **Delete stack** when prompted for confirmation.

For more information about deleting a stack in CloudFormation, see [Deleting a stack on the CloudFormation console](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/cfn-console-delete-stack.md)
in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

## (Optional) Connect your DB cluster to a Lambda function

You can also connect your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to a Lambda serverless compute resource.
Lambda functions allow you to run code without provisioning or managing infrastructure. A Lambda function
also allows you to automatically respond to code execution requests at any scale, from a dozen events
a day to hundreds of per second. For more information, see [Automatically connecting a Lambda function and an Aurora DB cluster](lambda-rds-connect.md).
