# The InnoDB history list length increased significantly

Starting on `date`, your history list for row changes increased
significantly, up to `length` on
`db-instance`. This increase affects query and database
shutdown performance.

## Supported engine versions

This insight information is supported for all versions of Aurora MySQL.

## Context

The InnoDB transaction system maintains multiversion concurrency control (MVCC). When
a row is modified, the pre-modification version of the data being modified is stored as
an undo record in an undo log. Every undo record has a reference to its previous redo
record, forming a linked list.

The _InnoDB history list_ is a global list of the undo logs for
committed transactions. MySQL uses the history list to purge records and log pages when
transactions no longer require the history. The _history list_
_length_ is the total number of undo logs that contain modifications in
the history list. Each log contains one or more modifications. If the InnoDB history
list length grows too large, indicating a large number of old row versions, queries and
database shutdowns become slower.

## Likely causes for this issue

Typical causes of a long history list include the following:

- Long-running transactions, either read or write

- A heavy write load

## Actions

We recommend different actions depending on the causes of your insight.

- [Don't begin any operation involving a database shutdown until the InnoDB history list decreases](#proactive-insights.history-list.actions.no-shutdown)

- [Identify and end long-running transactions](#proactive-insights.history-list.actions.long-txn)

- [Identify the top hosts and top users by using Performance Insights.](#proactive-insights.history-list.actions.top-PI)

### Don't begin any operation involving a database shutdown until the InnoDB history list decreases

Because a long InnoDB history list slows database shutdowns, reduce the list size
before initiating operations involving a database shutdown. These operations include
major version database upgrades.

### Identify and end long-running transactions

You can find long-running transactions by querying
`information_schema.innodb_trx`.

###### Note

Make sure also to look for long-running transactions on read replicas.

###### To identify and end long-running transactions

1. In your SQL client, run the following query:

```sql

SELECT a.trx_id,
         a.trx_state,
         a.trx_started,
         TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND,a.trx_started, now()) as "Seconds Transaction Has Been Open",
         a.trx_rows_modified,
         b.USER,
         b.host,
         b.db,
         b.command,
         b.time,
         b.state
FROM  information_schema.innodb_trx a,
         information_schema.processlist b
WHERE a.trx_mysql_thread_id=b.id
     AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND,a.trx_started, now()) > 10
ORDER BY trx_started
```

2. End each long-running transaction with the stored procedure [mysql.rds\_kill](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/mysql-stored-proc-ending.html#mysql_rds_kill).

### Identify the top hosts and top users by using Performance Insights.

Optimize transactions so that large numbers of modified rows are immediately
committed.

## Relevant metrics

The following metrics are related to this insight:

- `trx_rseg_history_len` – This counter metric can be viewed
in Performance Insights, as well as the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_METRICS` table.
For more information, see [InnoDB INFORMATION\_SCHEMA metrics table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-information-schema-metrics-table.html) in the MySQL
documentation.

- `RollbackSegmentHistoryListLength` – This Amazon CloudWatch metric
measures the undo logs that record committed transactions with delete-marked
records. These records are scheduled to be processed by the InnoDB purge
operation. The metric `trx_rseg_history_len` has the same value as
`RollbackSegmentHistoryListLength`.

- `PurgeBoundary` – The transaction number up to which InnoDB
purging is allowed. If this CloudWatch metric doesn't advance for extended periods of
time, it's a good indication that InnoDB purging is blocked by long-running
transactions. To investigate, check the active transactions on your Aurora MySQL
DB cluster. This metric is available only for Aurora MySQL version 2.11 and
higher, and version 3.08 and higher.

- `PurgeFinishedPoint` – The transaction number up to which
InnoDB purging is performed. This CloudWatch metric can help you examine how fast
InnoDB purging is progressing. This metric is available only for Aurora MySQL
version 2.11 and higher, and version 3.08 and higher.

- `TransactionAgeMaximum` – The age of the oldest active
running transaction. This CloudWatch metric is available only for Aurora MySQL version
3.08 and higher.

- `TruncateFinishedPoint` – The transaction number up to which
undo truncation is performed. This CloudWatch metric is available only for Aurora MySQL
version 2.11 and higher, and version 3.08 and higher.

For more information on the CloudWatch metrics, see [Instance-level metrics for Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.AuroraMonitoring.Metrics.html#Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Monitoring.Metrics.instances).
