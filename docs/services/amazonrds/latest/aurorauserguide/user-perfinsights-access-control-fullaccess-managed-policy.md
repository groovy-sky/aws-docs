# Attaching the AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsFullAccess policy to an IAM principal

`AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsFullAccess` is an AWS managed
policy that grants access to all operations of the Amazon RDS Performance Insights API.

If you attach `AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsFullAccess` to a permission set
or role, you must also attach the following CloudWatch
permissions:

- `GetMetricStatistics`

- `ListMetrics`

- `GetMetricData`

With these permissions, the recipient can use
Performance Insights with other console features.

For more information about CloudWatch permissions, see
[Amazon CloudWatch \
permissions reference](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/permissions-reference-cw.md).
