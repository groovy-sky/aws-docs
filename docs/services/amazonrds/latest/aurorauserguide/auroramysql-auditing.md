# Using Advanced Auditing with an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster

You can use the high-performance Advanced Auditing feature in Amazon Aurora MySQL to audit
database activity. To do so, you enable the collection of audit logs by setting several DB
cluster parameters. When Advanced Auditing is enabled, you can use it to log any combination
of supported events.

You can view or download the audit logs to review the audit information for one DB instance
at a time. To do so, you can use the procedures in
[Monitoring Amazon Aurora log files](user-logaccess.md).

###### Tip

For an Aurora DB cluster containing multiple DB instances, you might find it more convenient
to examine the audit logs for all instances in the cluster. To do so, you can use CloudWatch Logs.
You can turn on a setting at the cluster level to publish the Aurora MySQL audit log data to a log group in CloudWatch.
Then you can view, filter, and search the audit logs through the CloudWatch interface. For more information, see
[Publishing Amazon Aurora MySQL logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](auroramysql-integrating-cloudwatch.md).

## Enabling Advanced Auditing

Use the parameters described in this section to enable and configure Advanced Auditing
for your DB cluster.

Use the `server_audit_logging` parameter to enable or disable Advanced Auditing.

Use the `server_audit_events` parameter to specify what events to log.

Use the `server_audit_incl_users` and `server_audit_excl_users`
parameters to specify who gets audited. By default, all users are audited. For details
about how these parameters work when one or both are left empty, or the same
user names are specified in both, see
[server\_audit\_incl\_users](#AuroraMySQL.Auditing.Enable.server_audit_incl_users)
and
[server\_audit\_excl\_users](#AuroraMySQL.Auditing.Enable.server_audit_excl_users).

Configure Advanced Auditing by setting these parameters in the parameter group used by
your DB cluster. You can use the procedure shown in
[Modifying parameters in a DB parameter group in Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups-modifying.md)
to modify DB cluster parameters using the AWS Management Console. You can use the
[modify-db-cluster-parameter-group](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster-parameter-group.md)
AWS CLI command or the
[ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbclusterparametergroup.md) Amazon RDS API operation
to modify DB cluster parameters programmatically.

Modifying these parameters doesn't require a DB cluster restart when the parameter group is already associated
with your cluster. When you associate the parameter group with the cluster for the first time, a cluster restart
is required.

### server\_audit\_logging

Enables or disables Advanced Auditing. This parameter defaults to OFF; set it to
ON to enable Advanced Auditing.

No audit data appears in the logs unless you also define one or more types of events to audit
using the `server_audit_events` parameter.

To confirm that audit data is logged for a DB instance, check that some log files
for that instance have names of the form
`audit/audit.log.other_identifying_information`.
To see the names of the log files, follow the procedure in
[Viewing and listing database log files](user-logaccess-procedural-viewing.md).

### server\_audit\_events

Contains the comma-delimited list of events to log. Events must be specified in
all caps, and there should be no white space between the list elements, for example:
`CONNECT,QUERY_DDL`. This parameter defaults to an empty
string.

You can log any combination of the following events:

- CONNECT – Logs both successful and failed connections and also
disconnections. This event includes user information.

- QUERY – Logs all queries in plain text, including queries that fail
due to syntax or permission errors.

###### Tip

With this event type turned on, the audit data includes information about
the continuous monitoring and health-checking information that Aurora does
automatically. If you are only interested in particular kinds of operations,
you can use the more specific kinds of events. You can also use the CloudWatch
interface to search in the logs for events related to specific databases,
tables, or users.

- QUERY\_DCL – Similar to the QUERY event, but returns only data
control language (DCL) queries (GRANT, REVOKE, and so on).

- QUERY\_DDL – Similar to the QUERY event, but returns only data
definition language (DDL) queries (CREATE, ALTER, and so on).

- QUERY\_DML – Similar to the QUERY event, but returns only data
manipulation language (DML) queries (INSERT, UPDATE, and so on, and also
SELECT).

- TABLE – Logs the tables that were affected by query
execution.

###### Note

There's no filter in Aurora that excludes certain queries from audit logs. To
exclude `SELECT` queries, you must exclude all DML statements.

If a certain user is reporting these internal `SELECT` queries in
the audit logs, then you can exclude that user by setting the [server\_audit\_excl\_users](#AuroraMySQL.Auditing.Enable.server_audit_excl_users) DB cluster parameter. However, if that user
is also used in other activities and can't be omitted, then there is no other
option for excluding `SELECT` queries.

### server\_audit\_incl\_users

Contains the comma-delimited list of user names for users whose activity is logged. There should be no white space between
the list elements, for example: `user_3,user_4`. This parameter defaults to an empty string. The maximum length
is 1024 characters. Specified user names must match corresponding values in the `User` column of the
`mysql.user` table. For more information about user names, see [Account User Names and Passwords](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/user-names.html) in the MySQL
documentation.

If `server_audit_incl_users` and
`server_audit_excl_users` are both empty (the default), all users are audited.

If you add users to `server_audit_incl_users` and leave
`server_audit_excl_users` empty, then only those users are audited.

If you add users to `server_audit_excl_users` and leave
`server_audit_incl_users` empty, then all users
are audited, except for those listed in `server_audit_excl_users`.

If you add the same users to both `server_audit_excl_users` and
`server_audit_incl_users`, then those users are audited. When the same user
is listed in both settings, `server_audit_incl_users` is given higher priority.

Connect and disconnect events aren't affected by this variable; they are always
logged if specified. A user is logged even if that user is also specified in the
`server_audit_excl_users` parameter, because
`server_audit_incl_users` has higher priority.

### server\_audit\_excl\_users

Contains the comma-delimited list of user names for users whose activity isn't logged. There should be no white space
between the list elements, for example: `rdsadmin,user_1,user_2`. This parameter defaults to an empty string. The
maximum length is 1024 characters. Specified user names must match corresponding values in the `User` column of
the `mysql.user` table. For more information about user names, see [Account User Names and Passwords](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/user-names.html) in the MySQL
documentation.

If `server_audit_incl_users` and
`server_audit_excl_users` are both empty (the default), all users are audited.

If you add users to `server_audit_excl_users` and leave
`server_audit_incl_users` empty, then only those users that you list
in `server_audit_excl_users` are not audited, and all other users are.

If you add the same users to both `server_audit_excl_users` and
`server_audit_incl_users`, then those users are audited. When the same user
is listed in both settings, `server_audit_incl_users` is given higher priority.

Connect and disconnect events aren't affected by this variable; they are always
logged if specified. A user is logged if that user is also specified in the
`server_audit_incl_users` parameter, because that setting has higher
priority than `server_audit_excl_users`.

## Viewing audit logs

You can view and download the audit logs by using the console. On the **Databases** page,
choose the DB instance to show its details, then scroll to the **Logs** section.
The audit logs produced by the Advanced Auditing feature have names of the form
`audit/audit.log.other_identifying_information`.

To download a log file, choose that file in the **Logs** section and then choose
**Download**.

You can also get a list of the log files by using the
[describe-db-log-files](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-log-files.md)
AWS CLI command. You can download the contents of a log file by using the
[download-db-log-file-portion](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/download-db-log-file-portion.md)
AWS CLI command. For more information, see
[Viewing and listing database log files](user-logaccess-procedural-viewing.md)
and [Downloading a database log file](user-logaccess-procedural-downloading.md).

## Audit log details

Log files are represented as comma-separated variable (CSV) files in UTF-8 format. Queries are also wrapped in single quotes
(').

The audit log is stored separately on the local storage of each Aurora MySQL DB instance. Each instance distributes writes across four log files at a
time. The maximum size of a log file is 100 MB. When this non-configurable limit is reached, Aurora rotates the file and generates a new file.

###### Tip

Log file entries are not in sequential order. To order the entries, use the timestamp value. To see the latest
events, you might have to review all log files. For more flexibility in sorting and searching the log data,
turn on the setting to upload the audit logs to CloudWatch and view them using the CloudWatch interface.

To view audit data with more types of fields and with output in JSON format, you can also use
the Database Activity Streams feature. For more information, see
[Monitoring Amazon Aurora with Database Activity Streams](dbactivitystreams.md).

The audit log files include the following comma-delimited information in rows, in the
specified order:

FieldDescription

timestamp

The Unix time stamp for the logged event with microsecond
precision.

serverhost

The name of the instance that the event is logged for.

username

The connected user name of the user.

host

The host that the user connected from.

connectionid

The connection ID number for the logged operation.

queryid

The query ID number, which can be used for finding the relational
table events and related queries. For `TABLE` events,
multiple lines are added.

operation

The recorded action type. Possible values are:
`CONNECT`, `QUERY`, `READ`,
`WRITE`, `CREATE`, `ALTER`,
`RENAME`, and `DROP`.

database

The active database, as set by the `USE`
command.

object

For `QUERY` events, this value indicates the query that the database performed. For
`TABLE` events, it indicates the table name.

retcode

The return code of the logged operation.
