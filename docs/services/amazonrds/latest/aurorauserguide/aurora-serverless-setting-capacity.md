# Scaling Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster capacity manually

###### Important

AWS has [announced the end-of-life date for Aurora Serverless v1: March 31st, 2025](https://repost.aws/questions/QUhcMVoChXRm2HLi8F-yih1g/announcement-support-for-aurora-s/announcement-support-for-aurora-serverless-v1-ending-soon). All Aurora Serverless v1 clusters that are
not migrated by March 31, 2025 will be migrated to Aurora Serverless v2 during the maintenance window. If the upgrade fails, Amazon Aurora converts the Serverless v1
cluster to a provisioned cluster with the equivalent engine version during the maintenance window. If applicable, Amazon Aurora will enroll the
converted provisioned cluster in Amazon RDS Extended Support. For more information, see [Amazon RDS Extended Support with Amazon Aurora](extended-support.md).

Typically, Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters scale seamlessly based on the workload. However, capacity might not
always scale fast enough to meet sudden extremes, such as an exponential increase in transactions. In such
cases you can initiate the scaling operation manually by setting a new capacity value. After you set the
capacity explicitly, Aurora Serverless v1 automatically scales the DB cluster. It does so based on the cooldown
period for scaling down.

You can explicitly set the capacity of an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster to a specific value with the
AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

You can set the capacity of an Aurora DB cluster with the AWS Management Console.

###### To modify an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster

1. Open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

3. Choose the Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster that you want to modify.

4. For **Actions**, choose **Set capacity**.

5. In the **Scale database capacity** window, choose the following:

1. For the **Scale DB cluster to** drop-down selector, choose the new capacity that
       you want for your DB cluster.

2. For the **If a seamless scaling point cannot be found**
       check box, choose the behavior that you want for your Aurora Serverless v1 DB
       cluster's `TimeoutAction` setting, as follows:

- Clear this option if you want your capacity to remain unchanged if
Aurora Serverless v1 can't find a scaling point before timing out.

- Select this option if you want to force your Aurora Serverless v1 DB
cluster change its capacity even if it can't find a scaling point before
timing out. This option can result Aurora Serverless v1 dropping connections
that prevent it from finding a scaling point.

3. For **seconds**, enter the amount of time you want to allow
       your Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster to look for a scaling point before timing out.
       You can specify anywhere from 10 seconds to 600 seconds (10 minutes). The default
       is five minutes (300 seconds). This following example forces the
       Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster to scale down to 2 ACUs even if it can't find a
       scaling point within five minutes.

6. Choose **Apply**.

To learn more about scaling points, `TimeoutAction`, and cooldown periods, see
[Autoscaling for Aurora Serverless v1](aurora-serverless-v1-how-it-works.md#aurora-serverless.how-it-works.auto-scaling).

To set the capacity of an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster using the AWS CLI, run the
[modify-current-db-cluster-capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-current-db-cluster-capacity.html)
AWS CLI command, and specify the `--capacity` option. Valid capacity values include the
following:

- Aurora MySQL: `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`, `16`,
`32`, `64`, `128`, and `256`.

- Aurora PostgreSQL: `2`, `4`, `8`, `16`, `32`,
`64`, `192`, and `384`.

In this example, you set the capacity of an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster named
`sample-cluster` to `64`.

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-current-db-cluster-capacity --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster --capacity 64

```

You can set the capacity of an Aurora DB cluster with the
[ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity.html)
API operation. Specify the `Capacity` parameter. Valid capacity values include the following:

- Aurora MySQL: `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`, `16`,
`32`, `64`, `128`, and `256`.

- Aurora PostgreSQL: `2`, `4`, `8`, `16`, `32`,
`64`, `192`, and `384`.
