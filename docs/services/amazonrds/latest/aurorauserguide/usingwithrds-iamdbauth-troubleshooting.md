# Troubleshooting for IAM DB authentication

Following, you can find troubleshooting ideas for some common IAM DB authentication
issues and information on CloudWatch logs and metrics for IAM DB authentication.

## Exporting IAM DB authentication error logs to CloudWatch Logs

IAM DB authentication error logs are stored on the database host,
and you can export these logs your CloudWatch Logs account. Use the logs and
remediation methods in this page to troubleshoot IAM DB authentication issues.

You can enable log exports to CloudWatch Logs from the console, AWS CLI, and RDS API. For console instructions, see
[Publishing database logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](user-logaccess-procedural-uploadtocloudwatch.md).

To export your IAM DB authentication error logs to CloudWatch Logs when creating a DB cluster from the AWS CLI, use the following command:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier mydbinstance \
--region us-east-1 \
--engine postgres \
--engine-version 16 \
--master-username master \
--master-user-password password \
--publicly-accessible \
--enable-iam-database-authentication \
--enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports=iam-db-auth-error
```

To export your IAM DB authentication error logs to CloudWatch Logs when modifying a
DB clusterfrom the AWS CLI, use the following command:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster \
--region us-east-1 \
--cloudwatch-logs-export-configuration '{"EnableLogTypes":["iam-db-auth-error"]}'
```

To verify if your DB cluster
is exporting IAM DB authentication logs to CloudWatch Logs, check if the `EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports`
parameter is set to `iam-db-auth-error` in the output for the `describe-db-instances` command.

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-cluster --region us-east-1 --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster
            ...

             "EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports": [
                "iam-db-auth-error"
            ],
            ...

```

## IAM DB authentication CloudWatch metrics

Amazon Aurora delivers near-real time metrics
about IAM DB authentication to your Amazon CloudWatch account.
The following table lists the IAM DB authentication metrics available using CloudWatch:

MetricDescription

`IamDbAuthConnectionRequests`

Total number of connection requests made with IAM DB
authentication.

`IamDbAuthConnectionSuccess`

Total number of successful IAM DB authentication
requests.

`IamDbAuthConnectionFailure`

Total number of failed IAM DB authentication
requests.

`IamDbAuthConnectionFailureInvalidToken`

Total number of failed IAM DB authentication requests due to
invalid token.

`IamDbAuthConnectionFailureInsufficientPermissions`

Total number of failed IAM DB authentication requests due to
incorrect policies or permissions.

`IamDbAuthConnectionFailureThrottling`

Total number of failed IAM DB authentication requests due to
IAM DB authentication throttling.

`IamDbAuthConnectionFailureServerError`

Total number of failed IAM DB authentication requests due to
an internal server error in the IAM DB authentication
feature.

## Common issues and solutions

You might encounter the following issues when using IAM DB authention. Use the remediation steps
in the table to solve the issues:

ErrorMetric(s)CauseSolution

`[ERROR] Failed to authenticate the connection request for
                                    user db_user because the provided
                                    token is malformed or otherwise invalid. (Status Code: 400,
                                    Error Code: InvalidToken)`

`IamDbAuthConnectionFailure`

`IamDbAuthConnectionFailureInvalidToken`

The IAM DB authentiation token in the connection request is
either not a valid SigV4a token, or it is not formatted
correctly.

Check your token generation strategy in your application. In some
cases, make sure you are passing the token with valid formatting.
Truncating the token (or incorrect string formatting) will make the
token invalid.

`[ERROR] Failed to authenticate the connection request for
                                    user db_user because the token age is
                                    longer than 15 minutes. (Status Code: 400, Error
                                    Code:ExpiredToken)`

`IamDbAuthConnectionFailure`

`IamDbAuthConnectionFailureInvalidToken`

The IAM DB authentication token has expired. Tokens are only
valid for 15 minutes.

Check your token caching and/or token re-use logic in your
application. You should not re-use tokens that are older than 15
minutes.

``[ERROR] Failed to authorize the connection request for user
                                        db_user because the IAM policy
                                    assumed by the caller 'arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/
                                    <RoleName>/ <RoleSession>' is not authorized to perform
                                    `rds-db:connect` on the DB instance. (Status Code: 403, Error
                                    Code:NotAuthorized)``

`IamDbAuthConnectionFailure`

`IamDbAuthConnectionFailureInsufficientPermissions`

This error might be due to the following reasons:

- The IAM policy assumed by the application does not
authorize the `rds-db:connect` action.

- You are assuming the incorrect role/policy for
`db_user` to connect to the
database.

- You are assuming the correct policy for
`db_user`, but you are not
connecting to the correct database.

Verify that the IAM role and/or policy you are assuming in your
application. Make sure you assume the same policy to generate the
token as to connect to the DB.

`[ERROR] Failed to authorize the connection request for user
                                        db_user due to IAM DB
                                    authentication throttling. (Status Code: 429, Error Code:
                                    ThrottlingException)`

`IamDbAuthConnectionFailure`

`IamDbAuthConnectionFailureThrottling`

You are making too many connection requests to your DB in a short
amount of time. IAM DB authentication throttling limit is 200
connections per second.

Reduce the rate of establishing new connections with IAM
authentication. Consider implementing connection pooling using RDS Proxy in
order to reuse established connections in your application.

`[ERROR] Failed to authorize the connection request for user
                                db_user due to an internal IAM
                                DB authentication error. (Status Code: 500, Error Code: InternalError)`

`IamDbAuthConnectionFailure`

`IamDbAuthConnectionFailureThrottling`

There was an internal error while authorizing the
DB conneciton with IAM DB authentication.
