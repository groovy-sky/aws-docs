## mysql.rds\_kill

Ends a connection to the MySQL server.

### Syntax

```sql

CALL mysql.rds_kill(processID);
```

### Parameters

`processID`

The identity of the connection thread to be ended.

### Usage notes

Each connection to the MySQL server runs in a separate thread. To end a
connection, use the `mysql.rds_kill` procedure and pass in the thread ID
of that connection. To obtain the thread ID, use the MySQL [SHOW\
PROCESSLIST](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-processlist.html) command.

### Examples

The following example ends a connection with a thread ID of 4243:

```sql

CALL mysql.rds_kill(4243);
```

## mysql.rds\_kill\_query

Ends a query running against the MySQL server.

### Syntax

```sql

CALL mysql.rds_kill_query(processID);
```

### Parameters

`processID`

The identity of the process or thread that is running the query to be
ended.

### Usage notes

To stop a query running against the MySQL server, use the
`mysql_rds_kill_query` procedure and pass in the connection ID of the
thread that is running the query. The procedure then terminates the
connection.

To obtain the ID, query the MySQL [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema-processlist-table.html) or use the MySQL [SHOW\
PROCESSLIST](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-processlist.html) command. The value in the ID column from `SHOW
                    PROCESSLIST` or `SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST`
is the `processID`.

### Examples

The following example stops a query with a query thread ID of 230040:

```nohighlight

CALL mysql.rds_kill_query(230040);
```
