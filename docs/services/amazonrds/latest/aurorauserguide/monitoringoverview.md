# Monitoring tools for Amazon Aurora

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of Amazon Aurora and your other AWS solutions.
AWS provides various monitoring tools to watch Amazon Aurora, report when something is wrong, and take automatic actions when
appropriate.

### Amazon Aurora cluster status and recommendations

You can use the following automated tools to watch
Amazon Aurora and report when something is wrong:

- **Amazon Auroracluster**
**status** — View details about the current status of your cluster by using
the Amazon RDS console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

- **Amazon Aurora recommendations** — Respond to automated
recommendations for database resources, such as DB instances, DB
clusters, and DB cluster parameter groups. For more information, see [Recommendations from Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/monitoring-recommendations.html).

### Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon Aurora

Amazon Aurora integrates with
Amazon CloudWatch for additional monitoring capabilities.

- **Amazon CloudWatch** – This service monitors your AWS resources
and the applications you run on AWS in real time. You can use the following Amazon CloudWatch features
with Amazon Aurora:

- **Amazon CloudWatch metrics** – Amazon Aurora
automatically sends metrics to CloudWatch every minute for each active database. You don't get
additional charges for Amazon RDS metrics in CloudWatch.

For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon Aurora](aurora-auroramonitoring-metrics.md)

- **Amazon CloudWatch alarms** – You can watch a single
Amazon Aurora metric over a specific time period. You can then perform one or
more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a threshold that you set.

### Amazon RDS Performance Insights and operating-system monitoring

You can use the following automated tools to monitor Amazon Aurora performance:

- **Amazon RDS Performance Insights** – Assess the load on your
database, and determine when and where to take action. For more information, see [Monitoring DB load with Performance Insights on Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html).

- **Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring** – Look at metrics in real time
for the operating system. For more information, see [Monitoring OS metrics with Enhanced Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html).

### Integrated services

The following AWS services are integrated with Amazon Aurora:

- _Amazon EventBridge_ is a serverless event bus service that makes it easy to connect your
applications with data from a variety of sources. For more information, see [Monitoring Amazon Aurora events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/working-with-events.html).

- _Amazon CloudWatch Logs_ lets you monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon Aurora instances,
CloudTrail, and other sources. For more information, see [Monitoring Amazon Aurora log files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_LogAccess.html).

- _AWS CloudTrail_ captures API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your
AWS account and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. For more information,
see [Monitoring Amazon Aurora API calls in AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html).

- _Database Activity Streams_ is an Amazon Aurora feature that provides a near-real-time
stream of the activity in your DB cluster. For more
information, see [Monitoring Amazon Aurora with Database Activity Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/DBActivityStreams.html).

- _DevOps Guru for RDS_ is a capability of Amazon DevOps Guru that applies machine learning to
Performance Insights metrics for Amazon Aurora databases. For more information, see [Analyzing Aurora performance anomalies with Amazon DevOps Guru for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/devops-guru-for-rds.html).

## Manual monitoring tools

You need to manually monitor those items that the CloudWatch alarms don't cover. The Amazon RDS, CloudWatch, AWS Trusted Advisor
and other AWS console dashboards provide an at-a-glance view of the state of your AWS environment. We
recommend that you also check the log files on your DB instance.

- From the Amazon RDS console, you can monitor the following items for your resources:

- The number of connections to a DB instance

- The amount of read and write operations to a DB instance

- The amount of storage that a DB instance is currently using

- The amount of memory and CPU being used for a DB instance

- The amount of network traffic to and from a DB instance

- From the Trusted Advisor dashboard, you can review the following cost optimization, security, fault
tolerance, and performance improvement checks:

- Amazon RDS Idle DB Instances

- Amazon RDS Security Group Access Risk

- Amazon RDS Backups

- Amazon RDS Multi-AZ

- Aurora DB Instance Accessibility

For more information on these checks, see [Trusted Advisor best practices (checks)](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/best-practices).

- CloudWatch home page shows:

- Current alarms and status

- Graphs of alarms and resources

- Service health status

In addition, you can use CloudWatch to do the following:

- Create [customized dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/CloudWatch_Dashboards.html) to
monitor the services that you care about.

- Graph metric data to troubleshoot issues and discover trends.

- Search and browse all your AWS resource metrics.

- Create and edit alarms to be notified of problems.
