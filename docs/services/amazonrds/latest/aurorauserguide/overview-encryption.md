# Encrypting Amazon Aurora resources

Amazon Aurora protects your data both at rest and in
transit—whether moving between on-premises clients and Amazon Aurora,
or between Amazon Aurora and other AWS resources. Amazon Aurora
encrypts all user data in your Amazon Aurora DB clusters including logs, automated backups,
and snapshots.

After your data is encrypted,
Amazon Aurora handles authentication of
access and decryption of your data transparently with a minimal
impact on performance. You don't need to modify your database client
applications to use encryption.

###### Note

For encrypted and unencrypted DB clusters, data
that is in transit between the source and the read replicas is encrypted,
even when replicating across AWS Regions.

## Overview of encryption in Amazon Aurora resources

Amazon Aurora encrypted DB clusters provide an additional layer of data protection by
securing your data from unauthorized access to the underlying storage. All new
database clusters created on or after  February 18, 2026
, in Amazon Aurora are encrypted
at rest using industry standard AES-256 encryption. This encryption happens automatically in the background, securing your
data without requiring any action from you. It also helps reduce
the operational burden and complexity involved in protecting sensitive data.
With encryption at rest, you can secure compliance-sensitive and
security-critical applications against both accidental and malicious
threats while meeting regulatory requirements.

Amazon Aurora uses an AWS Key Management Service key to encrypt these resources. AWS KMS
combines secure, highly available hardware and software to provide
a key management system scaled for the cloud. When creating a new database
cluster, Amazon Aurora uses Server-Side Encryption (SSE) with an
[AWS-owned key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-owned-key)
by default. However, you can choose from three encryption
types based on your security and compliance needs:

- **AWS owned key (SSE-RDS)** –
A fully AWS-controlled encryption key that you cannot view or manage,
used automatically by Aurora for default encryption.

- **AWS managed key (AMK)** –
This key is created and managed by AWS and is visible in your account but not customizable.
There is no monthly fee, but AWS KMS API charges will apply.

- **Customer managed key (CMK)** –
The key is stored in your account and is created, owned, and managed by you.
You have full control over the KMS key (AWS KMS charges apply).

AWS managed keys are a legacy encryption option that remains available
for backward compatibility. Amazon Aurora uses AWS-owned keys by default
to encrypt your data, providing strong security protection without
additional charges or management overhead. For most use cases,
we recommend using either the default AWS-owned key for simplicity
and cost efficiency, or a customer managed key (CMK) if you require
full control over your encryption keys. For more information
about key types, see
[customer managed keys and AWS managed keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-mgmt).

###### Note

**Important:** For source database instances
or clusters created before February 18, 2026
,
where you did not opt in for encryption, snapshots, clones, and Amazon Aurora
replicas (read instance) created from those sources will remain unencrypted.
However, restore operations and logical replication outside the Amazon Aurora
cluster will produce encrypted instances.

For an Amazon Aurora encrypted DB cluster, all DB instances, logs, backups, and snapshots are
encrypted. For more information about the availability and limitations of encryption,
see [Availability of Amazon Aurora encryption](#Overview.Encryption.Availability) and
[Limitations of Amazon Aurora encrypted DB clusters](#Overview.Encryption.Limitations).

When you create an encrypted DB cluster, you can choose a customer managed key
or the AWS managed key for Amazon Aurora to encrypt your DB cluster, if you don't specify
the key identifier for a customer managed key, Amazon Aurora uses the AWS managed key for your new
DB cluster. Amazon Aurora creates an AWS managed key for Amazon Aurora for your AWS account.
Your AWS account has a different AWS managed key for Amazon Aurora for each AWS
Region.

To manage the customer managed keys used for encrypting and decrypting your Amazon Aurora resources,
you use the [AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide).

Using AWS KMS, you can create customer managed keys and define the policies to control the use of
these customer managed keys. AWS KMS supports CloudTrail, so you can audit KMS key usage to verify that
customer managed keys are being used appropriately. You can use your customer managed keys with Amazon Aurora
and supported AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, and Amazon Redshift. For a list of services that
are integrated with AWS KMS, see [AWS Service Integration](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/features). Some
considerations about using KMS keys:

- Once you create an encrypted DB instance, you cannot change the KMS key used by that instance.
Be sure to determine your KMS key requirements before creating your encrypted DB instance.
If you need to change the encryption key for your DB cluster, follow these steps:

- Create a manual snapshot of your cluster.

- Restore the snapshot and enable encryption with your desired KMS key
during the restore operation.

- If you restore an unencrypted snapshot and choose no encryption,
the database cluster created will be encrypted
using the default encryption at rest (AWS-owned key).

- You can't share a snapshot that has been encrypted using the
AWS managed key of the AWS account that shared the snapshot.

- Each DB instance in the DB cluster shares the same storage encrypted
with the same KMS key.

###### Important

Amazon Aurora can lose access to the KMS key for a DB cluster when you disable the
KMS key. In these cases, the encrypted DB cluster goes into
`inaccessible-encryption-credentials-recoverable` state. The DB cluster
remains in this state for seven days, during which the instance is stopped. API
calls made to the DB cluster during this time might not succeed. To recover the DB cluster,
enable the KMS key and restart this DB cluster. You can enable the KMS key from the
AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or RDS API. Restart the DB cluster using the AWS CLI command [start-db-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/start-db-cluster.html) or
AWS Management Console.

The `inaccessible-encryption-credentials-recoverable` state only
applies to DB clusters that can stop. This recoverable state is not applicable to instances
that can't stop, such as clusters with cross-Region
read replicas. For more information, see [Limitations for stopping and starting Aurora DB clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-cluster-stop-start.html#aurora-cluster-stop-limitations).

If the DB cluster isn't recovered within seven days, it goes into the terminal
`inaccessible-encryption-credentials` state. In this state, the DB cluster
is not usable anymore and you can only restore the DB cluster from a backup. We strongly
recommend that you always turn on backups to guard against the
loss of data in your databases.

During the creation of a DB cluster, Aurora checks if the calling principal has access
to the KMS key and generates a grant from the KMS key that it uses for the
entire lifetime of the DB cluster. Revoking the calling principals access to the
KMS key does not affect a running database. When using KMS keys in cross-account
scenarios, such as copying a snapshot to another account, the KMS key needs to be
shared with the other account. If you create a DB cluster from the snapshot without
specifying a different KMS key, the new cluster uses the KMS key from the source
account. Revoking access to the key after you create the DB cluster does not affect the
cluster. However, disabling the key impacts all DB clusters encrypted with that key. To
prevent this, specify a different key during the snapshot copy operation.

For more information about KMS keys, see [AWS KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#kms_keys) in the
_AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_ and [AWS KMS key management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Overview.Encryption.Keys.html).

## Encrypting an Amazon Aurora DB cluster

All new DB clusters created on or after February 18, 2026,
are encrypted by default with an AWS owned key.

To encrypt a new DB cluster, using AWS managed key or customer managed key,
choose the option
on the console. For information on creating a DB cluster, see [Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-createinstance.md).

If you use the [create-db-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster.html) AWS CLI command to create an encrypted DB
cluster, set the `--storage-encrypted` parameter. If you use the
[CreateDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbcluster.md) API operation, set the
`StorageEncrypted` parameter to true.

Once you have created an encrypted DB cluster, you can't change the
KMS key used by that DB cluster. Therefore, be sure to determine your
KMS key requirements before you create your encrypted DB cluster.

If you use the AWS CLI `create-db-cluster` command to create an
encrypted DB cluster with a customer managed key, set the `--kms-key-id`
parameter to any key identifier for the KMS key. If you use the Amazon RDS API
`CreateDBInstance` operation, set the `KmsKeyId`
parameter to any key identifier for the KMS key. To use a customer managed key in a
different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

## Determining whether encryption is turned on for a DB cluster

You can use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or RDS API to determine whether
encryption at rest is turned on for a DB cluster.

###### To determine whether encryption at rest is turned on for a DB cluster

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Databases**.

3. Choose the name of the DB cluster that you want to check
    to view its details.

4. Choose the **Configuration** tab and
    check the **Encryption** value.

![Checking encryption at rest for a DB cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/encryption-aurora-instance.png)

To determine whether encryption at rest is turned on for a DB
cluster by using the AWS CLI, call the [describe-db-clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-clusters.html) command with the following option:

- `--db-cluster-identifier` – The name of
the DB cluster.

The following example uses a query to return either
`TRUE` or `FALSE` regarding encryption at
rest for the `mydb` DB cluster.

###### Example

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier mydb --query "*[].{StorageEncrypted:StorageEncrypted}" --output text
```

To determine whether encryption at rest is turned on for a DB
cluster by using the Amazon RDS API, call the [DescribeDBClusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBClusters.html) operation with the following
parameter:

- `DBClusterIdentifier` – The name of the
DB cluster.

## Availability of Amazon Aurora encryption

Amazon Aurora encryption is currently available for all database
engines and storage types.

###### Note

Amazon Aurora encryption is not available for the db.t2.micro DB instance
class.

## Encryption in transit

**Encryption at the physical layer**

All data flowing accross AWS Regions over the AWS global network
is automatically encrypted at the physical layer before it leaves AWS
secured facilities. All traffic between AZs is encrypted. Additional layers of encryption,
including those listed in this section may provide additional protections.

**Encryption provided by Amazon VPC peering and Transit Gateway cross-Region peering**

All cross-Region traffic that uses Amazon VPC and Transit Gateway peering is automatically bulk-encrypted
when it exits a Region. An additional layer of encryption is automatically provided at the physical layer
for all traffic before it leaves AWS secured facilities.

**Encryption between instances**

AWS provides secure and private connectivity between DB instances of all
types. In addition, some instance types use the offload capabilities of the
underlying Nitro System hardware to automatically encrypt in-transit traffic
between instances. This encryption uses Authenticated Encryption with
Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms, with 256-bit encryption. There is no
impact on network performance. To support this additional in-transit traffic
encryption between instances, the following requirements must be met:

- The instances use the following instance types:

- **General purpose**: M6i,
M6id, M6in, M6idn, M7g

- **Memory optimized**: R6i,
R6id, R6in, R6idn, R7g, X2idn, X2iedn, X2iezn

- The instances are in the same AWS Region.

- The instances are in the same VPC or peered VPCs, and the traffic
does not pass through a virtual network device or service, such as a
load balancer or a transit gateway.

## Limitations of Amazon Aurora encrypted DB clusters

The following limitations exist for Amazon Aurora encrypted
DB clusters:

- You can't turn off encryption on an encrypted DB cluster.

- If you have an existing unencrypted cluster, all snapshots
created from that cluster will also be unencrypted.
To create an encrypted snapshot from an unencrypted cluster,
you must copy the snapshot and specify a customer managed key during the
copy operation. You cannot create an encrypted snapshot
from an unencrypted snapshot without specifying a customer managed key.

- You can't create an encrypted snapshot of an unencrypted DB
.

- A snapshot of an encrypted DB cluster
must be encrypted using the same KMS key as the DB cluster.

- You can't convert an unencrypted DB cluster to an encrypted
one. However, you can restore an unencrypted snapshot to an
encrypted Aurora DB cluster. To do this, specify a KMS key when you
restore from the unencrypted snapshot.

- If you have an existing unencrypted cluster, any Amazon Aurora
replica (read instance) created from that cluster will also be
unencrypted. To create an encrypted cluster from an
unencrypted cluster, you need to restore the database cluster.
The restored cluster will be encrypted by default after the
restore operation.

- To copy an encrypted snapshot from one AWS Region to another,
you must specify the KMS key in the destination AWS Region. This
is because KMS keys are specific to the AWS Region that they are
created in.

The source snapshot remains encrypted throughout the copy process.
Amazon Aurora uses envelope encryption
to protect data during the copy process. For more information about
envelope encryption, see [Envelope encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping) in the _AWS Key Management Service_
_Developer Guide_.

- You can't unencrypt an encrypted DB cluster. However, you can export
data from an encrypted DB cluster
and import the data into an unencrypted DB cluster.
