# Limitations for the Amazon RDS Data API

RDS Data API has the following limitations:

- You can only execute Data API queries on writer instances in a DB cluster. However, writer instances can accept both write and read queries.

- With Aurora global databases, you can enable Data API on both the primary and
secondary DB clusters. However, a secondary cluster doesn't have a writer
instance until it's promoted to be the primary. Data API requires access to the
writer instance for query processing, even for read queries. As a result, read
and write queries sent to the secondary cluster fail while it lacks a writer
instance. Once a secondary cluster is promoted and has a writer instance
available, Data API queries on that DB instance succeed.

- Data API isn't supported on T DB instance classes.

- For Aurora PostgreSQL version 14 and higher databases, Data API only supports
`scram-sha-256` for password encryption.

- The response size limit is 1 MiB. If the call returns more than 1 MiB of response data, the call is terminated.
