# Supported Regions and Aurora DB engines for Secrets Manager integration

With AWS Secrets Manager, you can replace hard-coded credentials in your code, including
database passwords, with an API call to Secrets Manager to retrieve the secret programmatically.
For more information about Secrets Manager, see [AWS Secrets Manager User Guide](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide.md).

You can specify that Amazon Aurora manages the master user password in Secrets Manager for an Aurora
DB cluster. Aurora generates the password, stores it in Secrets Manager, and rotates it regularly.
For more information, see [Password management with Amazon Aurora and AWS Secrets Manager](rds-secrets-manager.md).

Secrets Manager integration is available in all AWS Regions.
