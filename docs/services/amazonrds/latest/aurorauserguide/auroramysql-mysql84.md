# Aurora MySQL version 8.4 compatible with MySQL 8.4

Aurora MySQL version 8.4 is the latest major version of Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition, compatible with MySQL 8.4 Community Edition.
You can use Aurora MySQL version 8.4 to get the latest MySQL-compatible features, performance enhancements, and bug fixes.

Aurora MySQL version 8.4 supports the same Aurora features as the latest Aurora MySQL version 3 releases, with the following exceptions:

- Fast insert is not available in Aurora MySQL version 8.4.

Aurora MySQL version 8.4 uses a simplified version numbering scheme. The version number follows a
`major-version.minor-version` format,
where the major version (such as `8.4`) represents MySQL compatibility and the minor version
represents the feature and bug fix release. For example, `8.4.7` is the first minor version
in the 8.4 major version family. For more information, see [Checking Aurora MySQL version numbers](auroramysql-updates-versions.md).

## Features from MySQL 8.4 Community Edition

Aurora MySQL version 8.4 is compatible with MySQL 8.4 Community Edition. MySQL 8.4 is a Long-Term Support (LTS) release
that builds on MySQL 8.0 with the following key changes:

- The `mysql_native_password` authentication plugin is enabled by default but the setting is not
modifiable. The default `authentication_policy` is `*:caching_sha2_password`, so new
users are created with `caching_sha2_password` by default. Users authenticating
with `mysql_native_password` will continue working after upgrading, but we recommend migrating to
`caching_sha2_password`.

- Non-inclusive replication terminology is enforced. Older SQL statements such as `SHOW SLAVE STATUS`,
`CHANGE MASTER TO`, and `START SLAVE` now return syntax errors. Use the replacement statements
such as `SHOW REPLICA STATUS`, `CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`, and `START REPLICA`
instead.

- Hash table optimization for `EXCEPT` and `INTERSECT` set operations, improving performance
for these queries.

- In Aurora MySQL version 8.4.7 and higher, automatic histogram updates are disabled. If you specify `AUTO UPDATE`
when creating or altering a histogram, Aurora MySQL issues a warning and treats the histogram as
`MANUAL UPDATE`. Continue to refresh histogram statistics by running
`ANALYZE TABLE table_name UPDATE HISTOGRAM ON column_name`.

- Several parameters now have dynamic defaults that scale based on instance memory and CPU cores, including
`temptable_max_ram` (now 3% of total memory) and `innodb_buffer_pool_instances`.

- The `SET_USER_ID` privilege is replaced by two new privileges: `SET_ANY_DEFINER` and
`ALLOW_NONEXISTENT_DEFINER`. Two additional new privileges are also introduced:
`FLUSH_PRIVILEGES` and `OPTIMIZE_LOCAL_TABLE`.

- Foreign keys referencing non-unique keys are now blocked by default, controlled by the
`restrict_fk_on_non_standard_key` parameter.

Is New in MySQL 8.4](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/mysql-nutshell.html) in the _MySQL Reference Manual_.

###### Important

Before upgrading to Aurora MySQL version 8.4, review your database users and ensure they are using the
`caching_sha2_password` authentication plugin. In Aurora MySQL version 8.4, the
`mysql_native_password` plugin is enabled by default and this setting is not modifiable by customers.
When you upgrade from version 3, existing accounts that use `mysql_native_password` continue to work.
However, the default `authentication_policy` is `*:caching_sha2_password`, so we recommend
migrating users to `caching_sha2_password` before upgrading. For more information about the
`authentication_policy` parameter, see
[Authentication plugin management](auroramysql-compare-v3-v84.md#AuroraMySQL.Compare-v3-v84.auth-plugin)
and
[Authentication policy (new in 8.4)](auroramysql-upgrade-v3-v84-security.md#AuroraMySQL.Upgrade-v3-v84-security.auth-policy).

## Features removed in MySQL 8.4

The following features that were deprecated in MySQL 8.0 have been removed in MySQL 8.4:

- The `mysql_native_password` authentication plugin is enabled by default in Aurora MySQL version 8.4,
and this setting is not modifiable. The default `authentication_policy` is
`*:caching_sha2_password`, so new users are created with `caching_sha2_password` by
default. Note that in community MySQL 8.4, `mysql_native_password` is disabled by default; Aurora
MySQL 8.4 differs in that the plugin remains enabled to preserve compatibility with existing users.

- Non-inclusive replication SQL statements are removed. Statements such as `CHANGE MASTER TO`,
`SHOW SLAVE STATUS`, `START SLAVE`, `STOP SLAVE`, `SHOW SLAVE HOSTS`,
`RESET SLAVE`, `RESET MASTER`, `SHOW MASTER STATUS`, and `PURGE MASTER LOGS`
now return syntax errors. Use the replacement statements instead.

- The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLESPACES` table has been removed.

- The `LOW_PRIORITY` modifier with `LOCK TABLES ... WRITE` now causes a syntax error.

- The `AUTO_INCREMENT` modifier with `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE` columns is no longer
supported.

- The `SET_USER_ID` privilege has been removed. Use `SET_ANY_DEFINER` and
`ALLOW_NONEXISTENT_DEFINER` instead.

- The `expire_logs_days` parameter has been removed. Use `binlog_expire_logs_seconds`
instead.

- Weak TLS ciphers that do not provide perfect forward secrecy or do not use SHA2 are no longer allowed for
encrypted connections.

For the full list of removals, see [Features\
Removed in MySQL 8.4](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/mysql-nutshell.html) in the _MySQL Reference Manual_.

## Security enhancements in Aurora MySQL version 8.4

Aurora MySQL version 8.4 introduces several security enhancements and changes, including the following:

- Enhanced authentication with the `authentication_policy` parameter, replacing the
`default_authentication_plugin` parameter. For more information, see
[Comparing Aurora MySQL version 3 and Aurora MySQL version 8.4](auroramysql-compare-v3-v84.md).

- Aurora MySQL version 8.4 enforces stricter cryptographic standards aligned with the latest security
requirements on the `ssl_ciphers` (TLS 1.2) and `tls_ciphersuites` (TLS 1.3)
DB cluster parameters. For more information, see
[Security with Amazon Aurora MySQL](auroramysql-security.md).

- Comprehensive password policy support and improved password validation. For more information, see
[Password policies and Password validation in Aurora MySQL](auroramysql-passwordpolicies.md).

- New dynamic privileges and changes to master user behavior. For more information, see
[Master user account privileges](usingwithrds-masteraccounts.md).
