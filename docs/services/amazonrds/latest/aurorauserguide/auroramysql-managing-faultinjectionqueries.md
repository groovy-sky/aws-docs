# Testing Amazon Aurora MySQL using fault injection queries

You can test the fault tolerance of your Aurora MySQL DB cluster by using fault injection queries. Fault injection queries are
issued as SQL commands to an Amazon Aurora instance. They let you schedule a simulated occurrence of one of the following events:

- A crash of a writer or reader DB instance

- A failure of an Aurora Replica

- A disk failure

- Disk congestion

When a fault injection query specifies a crash, it forces a crash of the Aurora MySQL DB instance. The other fault injection queries
result in simulations of failure events, but don't cause the event to occur. When you submit a fault injection query, you also
specify an amount of time for the failure event simulation to occur for.

You can submit a fault injection query to one of your Aurora Replica instances by
connecting to the endpoint for the Aurora Replica. For more information, see
[Amazon Aurora endpoint connections](aurora-overview-endpoints.md).

Running fault injection queries requires all of the master user privileges. For more information, see [Master user account privileges](usingwithrds-masteraccounts.md).

## Testing an instance crash

You can force a crash of an Amazon Aurora instance using the `ALTER SYSTEM
                CRASH` fault injection query.

For this fault injection query, a failover will not occur. If you want to test a
failover, then you can choose the **Failover** instance action for
your DB cluster in the RDS console, or use the
[failover-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/failover-db-cluster.md)
AWS CLI command or the [FailoverDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-failoverdbcluster.md)
RDS API operation.

### Syntax

```nohighlight

ALTER SYSTEM CRASH [ INSTANCE | DISPATCHER | NODE ];
```

### Options

This fault injection query takes one of the following crash types:

- `INSTANCE` — A crash of
the MySQL-compatible database for the Amazon Aurora instance is
simulated.

- `DISPATCHER` — A crash
of the dispatcher on the writer instance for the Aurora DB cluster is
simulated. The _dispatcher_ writes updates to the
cluster volume for an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.

- `NODE` — A crash of both
the MySQL-compatible database and the dispatcher for the Amazon Aurora
instance is simulated. For this fault injection simulation, the cache is
also deleted.

The default crash type is `INSTANCE`.

## Testing an Aurora replica failure

You can simulate the failure of an Aurora Replica using the `ALTER SYSTEM
                SIMULATE READ REPLICA FAILURE` fault injection query.

An Aurora Replica failure blocks all requests from the writer instance to an Aurora Replica or all Aurora
Replicas in the DB cluster for a specified time interval. When the time interval
completes, the affected Aurora Replicas will be automatically synced up with the writer
instance.

### Syntax

```nohighlight

ALTER SYSTEM SIMULATE percentage_of_failure PERCENT READ REPLICA FAILURE
    [ TO ALL | TO "replica name" ]
    FOR INTERVAL quantity { YEAR | QUARTER | MONTH | WEEK | DAY | HOUR | MINUTE | SECOND };
```

### Options

This fault injection query takes the following parameters:

- `percentage_of_failure` — The percentage of
requests to block during the failure event. This value can be a double
between 0 and 100. If you specify 0, then no requests are blocked. If
you specify 100, then all requests are blocked.

- Failure type — The type of failure
to simulate. Specify `TO ALL` to simulate failures for all
Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster. Specify `TO` and the name
of the Aurora Replica to simulate a failure of a single Aurora Replica.
The default failure type is `TO ALL`.

- `quantity` — The amount
of time for which to simulate the Aurora Replica failure. The interval is
an amount followed by a time unit. The simulation will occur for that
amount of the specified unit. For example, `20 MINUTE` will
result in the simulation running for 20 minutes.

###### Note

Take care when specifying the time interval for your Aurora Replica
failure event. If you specify too long of a time interval, and your
writer instance writes a large amount of data during the failure
event, then your Aurora DB cluster might assume that your Aurora
Replica has crashed and replace it.

## Testing a disk failure

You can simulate a disk failure for an Aurora DB cluster using the
`ALTER SYSTEM SIMULATE DISK FAILURE` fault injection query.

During a disk failure simulation, the Aurora DB cluster randomly marks disk
segments as faulting. Requests to those segments will be blocked for the duration of
the simulation.

### Syntax

```nohighlight

ALTER SYSTEM SIMULATE percentage_of_failure PERCENT DISK FAILURE
    [ IN DISK index | NODE index ]
    FOR INTERVAL quantity { YEAR | QUARTER | MONTH | WEEK | DAY | HOUR | MINUTE | SECOND };
```

### Options

This fault injection query takes the following parameters:

- `percentage_of_failure`
— The percentage of the disk to mark as faulting during the
failure event. This value can be a double between 0 and 100. If you
specify 0, then none of the disk is marked as faulting. If you specify
100, then the entire disk is marked as faulting.

- `DISK index` — A
specific logical block of data to simulate the failure event for. If you
exceed the range of available logical blocks of data, you will receive
an error that tells you the maximum index value that you can specify.
For more information, see [Displaying volume status for an Aurora MySQL DB cluster](auroramysql-managing-volumestatus.md).

- `NODE index` — A
specific storage node to simulate the failure event for. If you exceed
the range of available storage nodes, you will receive an error that
tells you the maximum index value that you can specify. For more
information, see [Displaying volume status for an Aurora MySQL DB cluster](auroramysql-managing-volumestatus.md).

- `quantity` — The
amount of time for which to simulate the disk failure. The interval is
an amount followed by a time unit. The simulation will occur for that
amount of the specified unit. For example, `20 MINUTE` will
result in the simulation running for 20 minutes.

## Testing disk congestion

You can simulate a disk failure for an Aurora DB cluster using the
`ALTER SYSTEM SIMULATE DISK CONGESTION` fault injection query.

During a disk congestion simulation, the Aurora DB cluster randomly marks disk
segments as congested. Requests to those segments will be delayed between the
specified minimum and maximum delay time for the duration of the simulation.

### Syntax

```nohighlight

ALTER SYSTEM SIMULATE percentage_of_failure PERCENT DISK CONGESTION
    BETWEEN minimum AND maximum MILLISECONDS
    [ IN DISK index | NODE index ]
    FOR INTERVAL quantity { YEAR | QUARTER | MONTH | WEEK | DAY | HOUR | MINUTE | SECOND };
```

### Options

This fault injection query takes the following parameters:

- `percentage_of_failure` — The percentage of
the disk to mark as congested during the failure event. This value can
be a double between 0 and 100. If you specify 0, then none of the disk
is marked as congested. If you specify 100, then the entire disk is
marked as congested.

- `DISK index` Or `NODE index` — A specific disk or node to simulate
the failure event for. If you exceed the range of indexes for the disk
or node, you will receive an error that tells you the maximum index
value that you can specify.

- `minimum` And `maximum` — The minimum and maximum amount
of congestion delay, in milliseconds. Disk segments marked as congested
will be delayed for a random amount of time within the range of the
minimum and maximum amount of milliseconds for the duration of the
simulation.

- `quantity` — The amount
of time for which to simulate the disk congestion. The interval is an
amount followed by a time unit. The simulation will occur for that
amount of the specified time unit. For example, `20 MINUTE`
will result in the simulation running for 20 minutes.
