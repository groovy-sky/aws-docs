# Connecting to PostgreSQL with Kerberos authentication

You can connect to PostgreSQL with Kerberos authentication with the pgAdmin interface
or with a command-line interface such as psql. For more information about connecting,
see

[Connecting to an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster](aurora-connecting.md#Aurora.Connecting.AuroraPostgreSQL). For
information about obtaining the endpoint, port number, and other details needed for
connection, see [Viewing the endpoints for an Aurora cluster](aurora-overview-endpoints.md#Aurora.Endpoints.Viewing).

###### Note

GSSAPI authentication and encryption in PostgreSQL are implemented by the Kerberos
library `libkrb5.so`. Features such as `postgres_fdw` and
`dblink` also rely on this same library for outbound connections with
Kerberos authentication or encryption.

To use pgAdmin to connect to PostgreSQL with Kerberos authentication, take the
following steps:

1. Launch the pgAdmin application on your client computer.

2. On the **Dashboard** tab, choose **Add New**
**Server**.

3. In the **Create - Server** dialog box, enter a name
    on the **General** tab to identify the server in
    pgAdmin.

4. On the **Connection** tab, enter the following
    information from your Aurora PostgreSQL
    database.

- For **Host**, enter the endpoint for the
Writer instance of your
Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.
An endpoint looks similar to the
following:

```nohighlight

AUR-cluster-instance.111122223333.aws-region.rds.amazonaws.com
```

To connect to an on-premises Microsoft Active Directory from a
Windows client, you use the domain name of the AWS Managed
Active Directory instead of `rds.amazonaws.com` in
the host endpoint. For example, suppose that the domain name for
the AWS Managed Active Directory is
`corp.example.com`. Then for
**Host**, the endpoint would be specified
as follows:

```nohighlight

AUR-cluster-instance.111122223333.aws-region.corp.example.com
```

- For **Port**, enter the assigned port.

- For **Maintenance database**, enter the name
of the initial database to which the client will connect.

- For **Username**, enter the user name that
you entered for Kerberos authentication in [Step 7: Create PostgreSQL users for your Kerberos principals](postgresql-kerberos-setting-up.md#postgresql-kerberos-setting-up.create-logins).

5. Choose **Save**.

To use psql to connect to PostgreSQL with Kerberos authentication, take the
following steps:

1. At a command prompt, run the following command.

```nohighlight

kinit username
```

Replace `username` with the user
    name. At the prompt, enter the password stored in the Microsoft Active
    Directory for the user.

2. If the PostgreSQL DB cluster
    is using a publicly
    accessible VPC, put IP address for your DB cluster
    endpoint in your
    `/etc/hosts` file on the EC2 client. For example, the
    following commands obtain the IP address and then put it in the
    `/etc/hosts` file.

```nohighlight

% dig +short PostgreSQL-endpoint.AWS-Region.rds.amazonaws.com
;; Truncated, retrying in TCP mode.
ec2-34-210-197-118.AWS-Region.compute.amazonaws.com.
34.210.197.118

% echo " 34.210.197.118  PostgreSQL-endpoint.AWS-Region.rds.amazonaws.com" >> /etc/hosts
```

If you're using an on-premises Microsoft Active Directory from a
    Windows client, then you need to connect using a specialized endpoint.
    Instead of using the Amazon domain `rds.amazonaws.com` in the
    host endpoint, use the domain name of the AWS Managed Active
    Directory.

For example, suppose that the domain name for your AWS Managed
    Active Directory is `corp.example.com`. Then use the format
    `PostgreSQL-endpoint.AWS-Region.corp.example.com`
    for the endpoint and put it in the `/etc/hosts` file.

```nohighlight

% echo " 34.210.197.118  PostgreSQL-endpoint.AWS-Region.corp.example.com" >> /etc/hosts
```

3. Use the following psql command to log in to a PostgreSQL DB cluster that is integrated with Active Directory. Use a cluster or instance endpoint.

```nohighlight

psql -U username@CORP.EXAMPLE.COM -p 5432 -h PostgreSQL-endpoint.AWS-Region.rds.amazonaws.com postgres
```

To log in to the PostgreSQL DB cluster from a Windows client using an
    on-premises Active Directory, use the following psql command with the
    domain name from the previous step
    ( `corp.example.com`):

```nohighlight

psql -U username@CORP.EXAMPLE.COM -p 5432 -h PostgreSQL-endpoint.AWS-Region.corp.example.com postgres
```
