# Database authentication with Amazon Aurora

Amazon Aurora supports several ways to authenticate database users.

Password authentication is available by default for all DB
clusters. For Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL, you can also add either or both IAM database
authentication and Kerberos authentication for the same DB cluster.

Password, Kerberos, and IAM database authentication use different methods of
authenticating to the database. Therefore, a specific user can log in to a database
using only one authentication method.

For PostgreSQL, use only one of the following role settings for a user of a specific
database:

- To use IAM database authentication, assign the `rds_iam` role to
the user.

- To use Kerberos authentication, assign the `rds_ad` role to the
user.

- To use password authentication, don't assign either the
`rds_iam` or `rds_ad` roles to the user.

Don't assign both the `rds_iam` and `rds_ad` roles to a
user of a PostgreSQL database either directly or indirectly by nested grant access. If
the `rds_iam` role is added to the master user, IAM authentication takes
precedence over password authentication so the master user has to log in as an IAM
user.

###### Important

We strongly recommend that you do not use the master user directly in your
applications. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using a database user created
with the minimal privileges required for your application.

## Password authentication

With _password authentication,_ your database
performs all administration of user accounts. You create users with SQL statements
such as `CREATE USER`, with the appropriate clause required by the DB
engine for specifying passwords. For example, in MySQL the statement is `CREATE
                    USER` `name` `IDENTIFIED BY` `password`, while in PostgreSQL, the statement is
`CREATE USER` `name` `WITH PASSWORD` `password`.

With password authentication, your database controls and authenticates user
accounts. If a DB engine has strong password management features, they can enhance
security. Database authentication might be easier to administer using password
authentication when you have small user communities. Because clear text passwords
are generated in this case, integrating with AWS Secrets Manager can enhance security.

For information about using Secrets Manager with
Amazon Aurora, see [Creating a basic\
secret](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage-create-basic-secret.md) and [Rotating\
secrets for supported Amazon RDS databases](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets-rds.md) in the
_AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_. For information about programmatically
retrieving your secrets in your custom applications, see [Retrieving the secret\
value](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage-retrieve-secret.md) in the _AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.

## IAM database authentication

You can authenticate to your DB
cluster using AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM) database authentication. With this authentication method, you don't
need to use a password when you connect to a DB
cluster. Instead, you use
an authentication token.

For more information about IAM database authentication, including information
about availability for specific DB engines, see [IAM database authentication](usingwithrds-iamdbauth.md)
.

## Kerberos authentication

Amazon Aurora
supports external authentication of database users using
Kerberos and Microsoft Active Directory. Kerberos is a network authentication
protocol that uses tickets and symmetric-key cryptography to eliminate the need to
transmit passwords over the network. Kerberos has been built into Active Directory
and is designed to authenticate users to network resources, such as
databases.

Amazon Aurora
support for Kerberos and Active Directory provides the benefits
of single sign-on and centralized authentication of database users. You can keep
your user credentials in Active Directory. Active Directory provides a centralized
place for storing and managing credentials for multiple DB
clusters.

To use credentials from your self-managed Active Directory,
you need to setup a trust relationship to the Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory that the

DB cluster is joined to.

Aurora PostgreSQL and Aurora MySQL support one-way and two-way
forest trust relationships with forest-wide authentication or selective authentication.

In some scenarios, you can configure Kerberos authentication over an external trust relationship.
This requires your self-managed Active Directory to have additional settings. This includes but is not limited to
[Kerberos Forest Search Order](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/active-directory/kfso-not-work-in-external-trust-event-is-17).

Aurora supports Kerberos authentication for Aurora MySQL and
Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters. For more information, see [Using Kerberos authentication for Aurora MySQL](aurora-mysql-kerberos.md)
and [Using Kerberos authentication with Aurora PostgreSQL](postgresql-kerberos.md)
