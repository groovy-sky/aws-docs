## Quotas in Amazon Aurora

Each AWS account has quotas, for each AWS Region, on the number of Amazon Aurora
resources that can be created. After a quota for a resource has been reached, additional
calls to create that resource fail with an exception.

The following table lists the resources and their quotas per AWS Region.

This quota does not apply to Amazon Aurora, which has a maximum cluster volume of 128 TiB for each DB cluster.

###### Note

By default, you can have up to a total of 40 DB instances. RDS DB instances, Aurora
DB instances, Amazon Neptune instances, and Amazon DocumentDB instances apply to this
quota.

If your application requires more DB instances, you can request additional DB
instances by opening the [Service Quotas\
console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-1). In the navigation pane, choose **AWS**
**services**. Choose **Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon**
**RDS)**, choose a quota, and follow the directions to request a quota
increase. For more information, see [Requesting a quota\
increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-increase.html) in the _Service Quotas User Guide_.

For RDS for Oracle, you can create up to 15 read replicas per source DB instance in each
Region, but we recommend limiting replicas to 5 to minimize replication lag.

Backups managed by AWS Backup are considered manual DB clustersnapshots, but don't count toward the manual cluster snapshot quota. For information about AWS Backup,
see the [_AWS Backup Developer Guide_](../../../aws-backup/latest/devguide.md).

If you use any RDS API operations and exceed the default quota for the number of calls
per second, the Amazon RDS API issues an error like the following one.

**`ClientError: An error occurred (ThrottlingException) when calling the**
**API_name operation: Rate exceeded.`**

Here, reduce the number of calls per second. The quota is meant to cover most use
cases. If higher quotas are needed, you can request a quota increase by using one of the
following options:

- From the console, open the [Service\
Quotas console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home).

- From the AWS CLI, use the [request-service-quota-increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/service-quotas/request-service-quota-increase.html) AWS CLI command.

For more information, see the [_Service_\
_Quotas User Guide_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html).

## Naming constraints in Amazon Aurora

The naming constraints in Amazon Aurora are as follows:

- DB cluster identifier:

- Must contain 1–63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

- First character must be a letter.

- Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive
hyphens.

- Must be unique for all DB instances per AWS account, per AWS
Region.

- Initial database name – Database name constraints differ between
Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL. For more information, see the available settings
when creating each DB cluster.

- Master username – Master username constraints differ for each database
engine. For more information, see the available settings when creating the DB
cluster.

- Master password:

- The password for the database master user can include any printable
ASCII character except `/`, `'`, `"`,
`@`, or a space.

- The password can contain the following number of printable ASCII
characters depending on the DB engine:

- Aurora MySQL: 8–41

- Aurora PostgreSQL: 8–99

- DB parameter group:

- Must contain 1–255 alphanumeric characters.

- First character must be a letter.

- Hyphens are allowed, but the name cannot end with a hyphen or contain
two consecutive hyphens.

- DB subnet group:

- Must contain 1–255 characters.

- Alphanumeric characters, spaces, hyphens, underscores, and periods are
allowed.

## Amazon Aurora size limits

**Storage size limits**

Aurora cluster volume maximum size varies by engine version:

**256 TiB maximum:**

- Aurora PostgreSQL versions:

- 17.5 and all higher versions

- 16.9 and higher

- 15.13 and higher

- Aurora MySQL version 3.10 (compatible with MySQL 8.0.42)
and higher

**128 TiB maximum:**

- All earlier Aurora PostgreSQL
versions

- All available Aurora MySQL 3 versions; Aurora MySQL
version 2, versions 2.09 and higher

For more information on automatic storage
scaling, see [How Aurora storage automatically resizes](aurora-overview-storagereliability.md#aurora-storage-growth).

To monitor the remaining storage space, you can use the
`AuroraVolumeBytesLeftTotal` metric. For more information,
see [Cluster-level metrics for Amazon Aurora](aurora-auroramonitoring-metrics.md#Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Monitoring.Metrics.clusters).

**SQL table size limits**

For an Aurora MySQL DB cluster, the maximum table size is 64 tebibytes
(TiB). For an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster, the maximum table size is 32
tebibytes (TiB). We recommend that you follow table design best practices,
such as partitioning of large tables.

**Table space ID limits**

The maximum table space ID for Aurora MySQL is 2147483647. If you frequently
create and drop tables, make sure to be aware of your table space IDs and
plan to use logical dumps. For more information, see [Logical migration from MySQL to Amazon Aurora MySQL by using mysqldump](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.mysqldump.html).
