# Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon Aurora

The `AWS/RDS` namespace includes the following metrics that apply to database entities running on
Amazon Aurora. Some metrics apply to either Aurora MySQL, Aurora PostgreSQL, or both. Furthermore, some metrics are
specific to a DB cluster, primary DB instance, replica DB instance, or all DB instances.

For Aurora global database metrics, see [Amazon CloudWatch metrics for write forwarding in Aurora MySQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-write-forwarding-ams.html#aurora-global-database-write-forwarding-cloudwatch-ams) and [Amazon CloudWatch metrics for write forwarding in Aurora PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-write-forwarding-apg.html#aurora-global-database-write-forwarding-cloudwatch-apg). For Aurora parallel query metrics, see [Monitoring parallel query for Aurora MySQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-mysql-parallel-query-monitoring.html).

## Cluster-level metrics for Amazon Aurora

The following table describes metrics that are specific to Aurora clusters.

MetricDescriptionApplies toUnits

`AuroraGlobalDBDataTransferBytes`

In an Aurora Global Database, the amount of redo log data transferred from the source AWS
Region to a secondary AWS Region.

###### Note

This metric is available only in secondary AWS Regions.

Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL

Bytes

`AuroraGlobalDBProgressLag`

In an Aurora Global Database, he measure of how far the secondary cluster's storage volume is behind the primary cluster's storage volume for both user transactions and system transactions.

###### Note

This metric is available only in secondary AWS Regions.

Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL

Milliseconds

`AuroraGlobalDBReplicatedWriteIO`

In an Aurora Global Database, the number of write I/O operations replicated from the primary
AWS Region to the cluster volume in a secondary AWS Region. The billing calculations for the
secondary AWS Regions in a global database use `VolumeWriteIOPs` to account for
writes performed within the cluster. The billing calculations for the primary AWS Region in a
global database use `VolumeWriteIOPs` to account for the write activity within that
cluster, and `AuroraGlobalDBReplicatedWriteIO` to account for cross-Region replication
within the global database.

###### Note

This metric is available only in secondary AWS Regions.

Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL

Count

`AuroraGlobalDBReplicationLag`

For an Aurora Global Database, the average time elapsed replicating updates between the primary cluster's replication server and the secondary cluster's replication server.

###### Note

This metric is available only in secondary AWS Regions.

Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL

Milliseconds

`AuroraGlobalDBRPOLag`

In an Aurora Global Database, the recovery point objective (RPO) lag time. This metric measures
how far the secondary cluster is behind the primary cluster for user transactions.

###### Note

This metric is available only in secondary AWS Regions.

Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL

Milliseconds

`AuroraVolumeBytesLeftTotal`

The remaining available space for the cluster volume. As the cluster volume grows, this value decreases. If it
reaches zero, the cluster reports an out-of-space error.

If you want to detect whether your Aurora MySQL cluster is approaching the size limit of
128 tebibytes (TiB), this value is simpler and more reliable to monitor than `VolumeBytesUsed`.
`AuroraVolumeBytesLeftTotal` takes into account storage used for internal housekeeping and other
allocations that don't affect your storage billing.

Aurora MySQL

Bytes

`BacktrackChangeRecordsCreationRate`

The number of backtrack change records created over 5 minutes for your DB cluster.

Aurora MySQL

Count per 5 minutes

`BacktrackChangeRecordsStored`

The number of backtrack change records used by your DB cluster.

Aurora MySQL

Count

`BackupRetentionPeriodStorageUsed`

The total amount of backup storage used to support the point-in-time restore feature within the
Aurora DB cluster's backup retention window. This amount is included in the total reported by the
`TotalBackupStorageBilled` metric. It is computed separately for each Aurora
cluster. For instructions, see [Understanding Amazon Aurora backup storage usage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-storage-backup.html).

Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL

Bytes

`ServerlessDatabaseCapacity`

The current capacity of an Aurora Serverless DB cluster.

Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL

Count

`SnapshotStorageUsed`

The total amount of backup storage consumed by all Aurora snapshots for an Aurora DB cluster
outside its backup retention window. This amount is included in the total reported by the
`TotalBackupStorageBilled` metric. It is computed separately for each Aurora
cluster. For instructions, see [Understanding Amazon Aurora backup storage usage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-storage-backup.html).

Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL

Bytes

`TotalBackupStorageBilled`

The total amount of backup storage in bytes for which you are billed for a given Aurora DB
cluster. The metric includes the backup storage measured by the
`BackupRetentionPeriodStorageUsed` and `SnapshotStorageUsed` metrics.
This metric is computed separately for each Aurora cluster. For instructions, see [Understanding Amazon Aurora backup storage usage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-storage-backup.html).

Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL

Bytes

`VolumeBytesUsed`

The amount of storage used by your Aurora DB cluster.

This value affects the cost of the Aurora DB cluster (for pricing information, see the [Amazon RDS pricing page](http://aws.amazon.com/rds/pricing)).

This value doesn't reflect some internal storage allocations that don't affect
storage billing. For Aurora MySQL you can anticipate out-of-space issues more accurately by testing whether
`AuroraVolumeBytesLeftTotal` is approaching zero instead of comparing
`VolumeBytesUsed` against the storage limit of 128 TiB.

For clusters that are clones, the value of this metric depends on the amount of data added
or changed on the clone. The metric can also increase or decrease when the original cluster
is deleted, or as new clones are added or deleted. For details, see [Deleting a source cluster volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Clone.html#Aurora.Managing.Clone.Deleting)

Note that it doesn't make sense to choose a `--period` value that's small,
because Amazon RDS collects this metrics at intervals, not continuously.

Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL

Bytes

`VolumeReadIOPs`

The number of billed read I/O operations from a cluster volume within a 5-minute
interval.

Billed read operations are calculated at the cluster volume level, aggregated from all
instances in the Aurora DB cluster, and then reported at 5-minute intervals. The value is
calculated by taking the value of the **Read operations** metric
over a 5-minute period. You can determine the amount of billed read operations per second by
taking the value of the **Billed read operations** metric and
dividing by 300 seconds. For example, if the **Billed read**
**operations** returns 13,686, then the billed read operations per second is 45
(13,686 / 300 = 45.62).

You accrue billed read operations for queries that request database pages that aren't in
the buffer cache and must be loaded from storage. You might see spikes in billed read operations
as query results are read from storage and then loaded into the buffer cache.

Note that it doesn't make sense to choose a `--period` value that's small,
because Amazon RDS collects this metrics at intervals, not continuously.

###### Tip

If your Aurora MySQL cluster uses parallel query, you might see an increase in
`VolumeReadIOPS` values. Parallel queries don't use the buffer pool.
Thus, although the queries are fast, this optimized processing can result in an increase in
read operations and associated charges.

Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL

Count per 5 minutes

`VolumeWriteIOPs`

The number of write disk I/O operations to the cluster volume, reported at 5-minute intervals.
For a detailed description of how billed write operations are calculated, see
`VolumeReadIOPs`.

Note that it doesn't make sense to choose a `--period` value that's small,
because Amazon RDS collects this metrics at intervals, not continuously.

Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL

Count per 5 minutes

## Instance-level metrics for Amazon Aurora

The following instance-specific Amazon CloudWatch metrics apply to all Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL instances
unless noted otherwise.

MetricDescriptionApplies toUnits

`AbortedClients`

The number of client connections that have not been closed properly.

Aurora MySQL

Count

`ActiveTransactions`

The average number of current transactions executing on an Aurora database instance per
second.

By default, Aurora doesn't enable this metric. To begin measuring this value, set
`innodb_monitor_enable='all'` in the DB parameter group for a specific DB
instance.

Aurora MySQL

Count per second

`ACUUtilization`

The value of the `ServerlessDatabaseCapacity` metric divided
by the maximum ACU value of the DB cluster.

This metric is applicable only for Aurora
Serverless v2.

Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL

Percentage

`AuroraBinlogReplicaLag`

The amount of time that a binary log replica DB cluster running on Aurora MySQL lags behind the binary log replication source. A lag
means that the source is generating records faster than the replica can apply them.

This metric reports different values depending on the engine version:

**Aurora MySQL version 2**

The `Seconds_Behind_Master` field of the MySQL `SHOW SLAVE STATUS`

**Aurora MySQL version 3**

`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`

You can use this metric to monitor errors and replica lag in a cluster that acts as a binary
log replica. The metric value indicates the following:

**A high value**

The replica is lagging the replication source.

**`0` or a value close to `0`**

The replica process is active and current.

**`-1`**

Aurora can't determine the lag, which can happen during replica setup or when the replica is in an error state.

Because binary log replication only occurs on the writer instance of the cluster, we recommend
using the version of this metric associated with the WRITER role.

For more information about administering replication, see [Replicating Amazon Aurora MySQL DB clusters across AWS Regions](auroramysql-replication-crossregion.md). For more information about
troubleshooting, see [Amazon Aurora MySQL replication issues](chap-troubleshooting.md#CHAP_Troubleshooting.MySQL).
