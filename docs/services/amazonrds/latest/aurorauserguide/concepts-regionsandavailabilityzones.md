# Regions and Availability Zones

Amazon cloud computing resources are hosted in multiple locations world-wide. These
locations are composed of AWS Regions and Availability Zones. Each _AWS Region_ is a separate geographic area. Each AWS Region
has multiple, isolated locations known as _Availability_
_Zones_.

###### Note

For information about finding the Availability Zones for an AWS Region, see [Describe \
your Availability Zones](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-regions-availability-zones.md#availability-zones-describe) in the Amazon EC2 documentation.

Amazon operates state-of-the-art, highly-available data centers. Although rare, failures can
occur that affect the availability of DB instances that are in the same location. If you
host all your DB instances in one location that is affected by such a failure, none of your
DB instances will be available.

![AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/Con-AZ.png)

It is important to remember that each AWS Region is completely independent. Any Amazon RDS
activity you initiate (for example, creating database instances or listing available
database instances) runs only in your current default AWS Region. The default AWS Region
can be changed in the console, or by setting the [`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-region) environment variable. Or it can be
overridden by using the `--region` parameter with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For more
information, see [Configuring the\
AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html), specifically the sections about environment variables and command
line options.

Amazon RDS supports special AWS Regions called AWS GovCloud (US). These are designed to allow US
government agencies and customers to move more sensitive workloads into the cloud. The
AWS GovCloud (US) Regions address the US government's specific regulatory and compliance
requirements. For more information, see [What\
is AWS GovCloud (US)?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/whatis.html)

To create or work with an Amazon RDS DB instance in a specific AWS Region, use the corresponding regional service endpoint.

###### Note

Aurora doesn't support Local Zones.

## AWS Regions

Each AWS Region is designed to be isolated from the other AWS Regions. This design
achieves the greatest possible fault tolerance and stability.

When you view your resources, you see only the resources that are tied to the AWS Region that
you specified. This is because AWS Regions are isolated from each other, and we don't
automatically replicate resources across AWS Regions.

### Region availability

When you work with an Aurora DB cluster using the command line interface or API operations, make sure that you specify its
regional endpoint.

## Availability Zones

An Availability Zone is an isolated location in a given
AWS Region. Each Region has multiple Availability Zones (AZ) designed to provide high
availability for the Region. An AZ is identified by the AWS Region code followed by a
letter identifier (for example, `us-east-1a`). If you create your
VPC and subnets rather than using the default VPC, you define each subnet in a specific
AZ. When you create an Aurora DB cluster, Aurora creates the primary instance in one of
the subnets in the VPC's DB subnet group. It thus associates that instance with a
specific AZ chosen by Aurora.

Each Aurora DB cluster hosts copies of its storage in three separate
AZs selected automatically by Aurora from the AZs in your DB subnet group. Every DB
instance in the cluster must be in one of these three AZs.

When you create a DB instance in your cluster, Aurora automatically
chooses an appropriate AZ for that instance if you don't specify an AZ.

Use the [describe-availability-zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-availability-zones.html)
Amazon EC2 command as follows to describe the Availability Zones within the specified Region that are enabled for your account.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region region-name
```

For example, to describe the Availability Zones within the US East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1) that are enabled for
your account, run the following command:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region us-east-1
```

To learn how to specify the AZ when you create a cluster or add instances to it,
see [Configure the network for the DB cluster](aurora-createinstance.md#Aurora.CreateInstance.Prerequisites.VPC).

## Local time zone for Amazon Aurora DB clusters

By default, the time zone for an Amazon Aurora DB cluster is Universal Time
Coordinated (UTC). You can set the time zone for instances in your DB cluster to the
local time zone for your application instead.

To set the local time zone for a DB cluster, set the time zone parameter to one of the supported values. You set this
parameter in the cluster parameter group for your DB cluster.

- For Aurora MySQL, the name of this parameter is `time_zone`. For information on best practices for setting
the `time_zone` parameter, see [Optimizing timestamp operations](auroramysql-bestpractices-performance.md#AuroraMySQL.BestPractices.Performance.TimeZone).

- For Aurora PostgreSQL, the name of this parameter is `timezone`.

When you set the time zone parameter for a DB cluster, all instances in the DB cluster change to use the new local time zone.
In some cases, other Aurora DB clusters might be using the same cluster parameter group. If so, all instances in those DB
clusters change to use the new local time zone also. For information on cluster-level parameters, see [Amazon Aurora DB cluster and DB instance parameters](user-workingwithdbclusterparamgroups.md#Aurora.Managing.ParameterGroups).

After you set the local time zone, all new connections to the database reflect the
change. In some cases, you might have open connections to your database when you change
the local time zone. If so, you don't see the local time zone update until after you
close the connection and open a new connection.

If you are replicating across AWS Regions, the replication source DB cluster and the replica use different parameter
groups. Parameter groups are unique to an AWS Region. To use the same local time zone for each instance, make sure to set the
time zone parameter in the parameter groups for both the replication source and the replica.

When you restore a DB cluster from a DB cluster snapshot, the local time zone is
set to UTC. You can update the time zone to your local time zone after the restore is
complete. In some cases, you might restore a DB cluster to a point in time. If so, the
local time zone for the restored DB cluster is the time zone setting from the parameter
group of the restored DB cluster.

The following table lists some of the values to which you can set your local time zone. To list all of the available time
zones, you can use the following SQL queries:

- Aurora MySQL: `select * from mysql.time_zone_name;`

- Aurora PostgreSQL: `select * from pg_timezone_names;`

###### Note

For some time zones, time values for certain date ranges can be reported incorrectly as noted in the table. For Australia
time zones, the time zone abbreviation returned is an outdated value as noted in the table.
