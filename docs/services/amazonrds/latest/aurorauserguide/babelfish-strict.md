# Managing Babelfish error handling with escape hatches

Babelfish mimics SQL behavior for control flow and transaction state whenever
possible. When Babelfish encounters an error, it returns an error code similar to
the SQL Server error code. If Babelfish can't map the error to a SQL Server code, it
returns a fixed error code ( `33557097`) and takes specific actions based on the
type of error, as follows:

- For compile time errors, Babelfish rolls back the transaction.

- For runtime errors, Babelfish ends the batch and rolls back the
transaction.

- For protocol error between client and server, the transaction isn't rolled
back.

If an error code can't be mapped to an equivalent code and the code for a similar error is available, the
error code is mapped to the alternative code. For example, the behaviors that cause SQL Server codes
`8143` and `8144` are both mapped to `8143`.

Errors that can't be mapped don't respect a `TRY... CATCH`
construct.

You can use `@@ERROR` to return a SQL Server error code, or the
`@@PGERROR` function to return a PostgreSQL error code. You can also use
the `fn_mapped_system_error_list` function to return a list of mapped error
codes. For information about PostgreSQL error codes, see [the PostgreSQL\
website](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html).

## Modifying Babelfish escape hatch settings

To handle statements that might fail, Babelfish defines certain options
called escape hatches. An _escape hatch_ is an option that specifies
Babelfish behavior when it encounters an unsupported feature or
syntax.

You can use the `sp_babelfish_configure` stored procedure to control the
settings of an escape hatch. Use the script to set the escape hatch to
`ignore` or `strict`. If it's set to
`strict`, Babelfish returns an error that you need to correct
before continuing.

To apply changes to the current session and on the cluster level, include the
`server` keyword.

The usage is as follows:

- To list all escape hatches and their status, plus usage information, run `sp_babelfish_configure`.

- To list the named escape hatches and their values, for the current session or cluster-wide,
run the command `sp_babelfish_configure
  									'hatch_name'`
where `hatch_name` is the identifier of one or more
escape hatches. `hatch_name` can use SQL wildcards, such as '%'.

- To set one or more escape hatches to the value specified, run `sp_babelfish_configure
  								['hatch_name' [, 'strict'|'ignore' [,
  							'server']]`. To make the
settings permanent on a cluster-wide level, include the `server` keyword, such as
shown in the following:

```nohighlight

EXECUTE sp_babelfish_configure 'escape_hatch_unique_constraint', 'ignore', 'server'
```

To set them for the current session only, don't use `server`.

- To reset all escape hatches to their default values, run `sp_babelfish_configure 'default'` (Babelfish 1.2.0 and higher).

The string identifying the hatch (or hatches) can include SQL wildcards. For example, the
following sets all syntax escape hatches to `ignore` for the
Aurora PostgreSQL cluster.

```nohighlight

EXECUTE sp_babelfish_configure '%', 'ignore', 'server'
```

In the following table you can find descriptions and default values for the Babelfish predefined escape hatches.

Escape hatchDescriptionDefault`escape_hatch_checkpoint`

Allows the use of CHECKPOINT statement in the procedural code, but the CHECKPOINT statement is currently not implemented.

ignore

`escape_hatch_constraint_name_for_default`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to default constraint names.

ignore

`escape_hatch_database_misc_options`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to the following options on CREATE DATABASE:
CONTAINMENT, DB\_CHAINING, TRUSTWORTHY, PERSISTENT\_LOG\_BUFFER.

ignore

`escape_hatch_for_replication`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to the \[NOT\] FOR REPLICATION clause when
creating or altering a table.

strict

`escape_hatch_fulltext`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to FULLTEXT features, such a DEFAULT\_FULLTEXT\_LANGUAGE in
CREATE/ALTER DATABASE, CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX, or sp\_fulltext\_database.

ignore

`escape_hatch_ignore_dup_key`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to CREATE/ALTER TABLE and CREATE INDEX. When IGNORE\_DUP\_KEY=ON, raises
an error when set to `strict` (the default) or ignores the error when set to `ignore`
(Babelfish version 1.2.0 and higher).

strict

`escape_hatch_index_clustering`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to the CLUSTERED or NONCLUSTERED keywords
for indexes and PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraints. When
CLUSTERED is ignored, the index or constraint is still created
as if NONCLUSTERED was specified.

ignore

`escape_hatch_index_columnstore`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to the COLUMNSTORE clause.
If you specify `ignore`, Babelfish creates a regular B-tree index.

strict

`escape_hatch_join_hints`

Controls the behavior of keywords in a JOIN operator: LOOP,
HASH, MERGE, REMOTE, REDUCE, REDISTRIBUTE, REPLICATE.

ignore

`escape_hatch_language_non_english`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to languages other than English for onscreen
messages. Babelfish currently supports only
`us_english` for onscreen messages. SET LANGUAGE
might use a variable containing the language name, so the actual
language being set can only be detected at run time.

strict

`escape_hatch_login_hashed_password`

When ignored, suppresses the error for the `HASHED` keyword for
`CREATE LOGIN` and `ALTER LOGIN`.

strict

`escape_hatch_login_misc_options`

When ignored, suppresses the error for other keywords besides
`HASHED`, `MUST_CHANGE`, `OLD_PASSWORD`,
and `UNLOCK` for `CREATE LOGIN` and `ALTER LOGIN`.

strict

`escape_hatch_login_old_password`

When ignored, suppresses the error for the `OLD_PASSWORD` keyword for
`CREATE LOGIN` and `ALTER LOGIN`.

strict

`escape_hatch_login_password_must_change`

When ignored, suppresses the error for the `MUST_CHANGE` keyword for
`CREATE LOGIN` and `ALTER LOGIN`.

strict

`escape_hatch_login_password_unlock`

When ignored, suppresses the error for the `UNLOCK` keyword for
`CREATE LOGIN` and `ALTER LOGIN`.

strict

`escape_hatch_nocheck_add_constraint`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to the WITH CHECK or NOCHECK clause for constraints.

strict

`escape_hatch_nocheck_existing_constraint`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to FOREIGN KEY or CHECK constraints.

strict

`escape_hatch_query_hints`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to query hints. When this option is set to
ignore, the server ignores hints that use the OPTION (...)
clause to specify query processing aspects. Examples include
SELECT FROM ... OPTION(MERGE JOIN HASH, MAXRECURSION
10)).

ignore

`escape_hatch_rowversion`

Controls the behavior of the ROWVERSION and TIMESTAMP datatypes. For usage information,
see [Using Babelfish features with limited implementation](babelfish-compatibility-tsql-limited-implementation.md).

strict

`escape_hatch_schemabinding_function`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to the WITH SCHEMABINDING clause. By
default, the WITH SCHEMABINDING clause is ignored when specified
with the CREATE or ALTER FUNCTION command.

ignore

`escape_hatch_schemabinding_procedure`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to the WITH SCHEMABINDING clause. By
default, the WITH SCHEMABINDING clause is ignored when specified
with the CREATE or ALTER PROCEDURE command.

ignore

`escape_hatch_rowguidcol_column`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to the ROWGUIDCOL clause when creating or
altering a table.

strict

`escape_hatch_schemabinding_trigger`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to the WITH SCHEMABINDING clause. By
default, the WITH SCHEMABINDING clause is ignored when specified
with the CREATE or ALTER TRIGGER command.

ignore

`escape_hatch_schemabinding_view`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to the WITH SCHEMABINDING clause. By
default, the WITH SCHEMABINDING clause is ignored when specified
with the CREATE or ALTER VIEW command.

ignore

`escape_hatch_session_settings`

Controls Babelfish behavior toward unsupported session-level SET
statements.

ignore

`escape_hatch_showplan_all`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to SET SHOWPLAN\_ALL and SET STATISTICS PROFILE. When set to ignore, they behave
like SET BABELFISH\_SHOWPLAN\_ALL and SET BABELFISH\_STATISTICS PROFILE; when set to strict, they are silently ignored.

strict

`escape_hatch_storage_on_partition`

Controls Babelfish behavior related to the `ON partition_scheme column
								` clause when defining partitioning. Babelfish
currently doesn't implement partitioning.

strict

`escape_hatch_storage_options`

Escape hatch on any storage option used in CREATE, ALTER DATABASE, TABLE, INDEX. This
includes clauses (LOG) ON, TEXTIMAGE\_ON, FILESTREAM\_ON that
define storage locations (partitions, file groups) for tables,
indexes, and constraints, and also for a database. This escape
hatch setting applies to all of these clauses (including ON
\[PRIMARY\] and ON "DEFAULT"). The exception is when a partition
is specified for a table or index with ON partition\_scheme
(column).

ignore

`escape_hatch_table_hints`

Controls the behavior of table hints specified using the WITH (...) clause.

ignore

`escape_hatch_unique_constraint`

When set to strict, an obscure semantic difference between SQL Server and PostgreSQL in
handling NULL values on indexed columns can raise errors. The semantic difference only
emerges in unrealistic use cases, so you can set this escape hatch to 'ignore' to
avoid seeing the error.

Deprecated from the following versions: 3.6.0 and higher versions, 4.2.0 and higher versions
