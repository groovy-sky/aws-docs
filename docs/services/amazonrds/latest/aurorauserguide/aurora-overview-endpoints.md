# Amazon Aurora endpoint connections

Amazon Aurora typically involves a cluster of DB instances instead of a single instance. Each
connection is handled by a specific DB instance. When you connect to an Aurora cluster, the
host name and port that you specify point to an intermediate handler called an _endpoint_. Aurora uses the endpoint mechanism to abstract these
connections. Thus, you don't have to hardcode all the hostnames or write your own logic for
balancing and rerouting connections when some DB instances aren't available.

For certain Aurora tasks, different instances or groups of instances perform different
roles. For example, the primary instance handles all data definition language (DDL) and data
manipulation language (DML) statements. Up to 15 Aurora Replicas handle read-only query
traffic.

## Types of Aurora endpoints

Using endpoints, you can map each connection to the appropriate instance or group of
instances based on your use case. For example, to perform DDL statements you can connect to
whichever instance is the primary instance. To perform queries, you can connect to the
reader endpoint, with Aurora automatically performing connection-balancing among all the
Aurora Replicas. For clusters with DB instances of different capacities or configurations,
you can connect to custom endpoints associated with different subsets of DB instances. For
diagnosis or tuning, you can connect to a specific instance endpoint to examine details
about a specific DB instance.

An endpoint is represented as an Aurora-specific URL that contains a host address and a
port. The following types of endpoints are available from an Aurora DB cluster.

**Cluster endpoint**

Connect to the primary instance of your cluster to develop and test applications,
and perform transformations like `INSERT` statements and DDL, DML, and ETL
operations. Find the cluster endpoint location by using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or Amazon RDS
API, as described in [Viewing the endpoints for an Aurora cluster](#Aurora.Endpoints.Viewing).

For more information about cluster endpoints, see [Cluster endpoints for Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Endpoints.Cluster.html).

**Reader endpoint**

Perform queries. Aurora automatically performs connection-balancing among all the
Aurora Replicas. Find the reader endpoint location by using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or
Amazon RDS API, as described in [Viewing the endpoints for an Aurora cluster](#Aurora.Endpoints.Viewing).

For more information about reader endpoints, see [Reader endpoints for Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Endpoints.Reader.html).

**Instance endpoint**

Examine details about a specific DB instance for diagnosis or tuning. You can find the
instance endpoint location for each of your instances in the AWS Management Console only, on the
instance detail page for your instance.

For more information about instance endpoints, see [Instance endpoints for Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Endpoints.Instance.html).

**Custom endpoint**

Connect to different subsets of DB instances on the DB cluster. This is useful when you have
different instance capacities and configurations within your DB cluster. Find the custom
endpoint locations by using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or Amazon RDS API, as described in [Viewing the endpoints for an Aurora cluster](#Aurora.Endpoints.Viewing).

For more information about custom endpoints, see [Custom endpoints for Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Endpoints.Custom.html).

**Aurora Global Database writer endpoint**

Aurora Global Database has a special kind of endpoint that serves the same purpose
as the cluster endpoint of a standalone Aurora cluster. It handles both write and read
requests. When a secondary cluster becomes the new primary cluster due to a switchover
or failover, Aurora automatically switches this endpoint to point to the cluster
endpoint of the new primary cluster, in the other AWS Region. That way, you
don't have to encode the AWS Region into the connection string for your
application, and you don't have to change the connection string when the layout
of the global database changes. Aurora creates this endpoint when you set up an Aurora
Global Database, for example by choosing **Add Region** for an Aurora
cluster in the AWS Management Console.

For information on how you can use this type of endpoint with Aurora Global
Database, see [Connecting to Amazon Aurora Global Database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-connecting.html).

## Viewing the endpoints for an Aurora cluster

While you can only find the instance endpoint location on the instance detail page in
the AWS Management Console, you can use the console, AWS CLI, or Amazon RDS API to find the locations of
cluster, reader, and custom endpoints.

Console

In the AWS Management Console, find the cluster endpoint, the reader endpoint, and any custom
endpoints in the instance details page for your cluster. You see the instance endpoint
in the detail page for each instance. When you connect, append the associated port
number, following a colon, to the endpoint name shown on the detail page.

AWS CLI

With the AWS CLI, you find the writer, reader, and any custom endpoints in the
output of the [describe-db-clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-clusters.html) command. For example, the following command shows the
endpoint attributes for all clusters in your current AWS Region.

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-clusters --query '*[].{Endpoint:Endpoint,ReaderEndpoint:ReaderEndpoint,CustomEndpoints:CustomEndpoints}'

```

Amazon RDS API

With the Amazon RDS API, you retrieve the endpoints by calling the [DescribeDBClusterEndpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBClusterEndpoints.html) operation.

## How Aurora endpoints work with high availability

For clusters where high availability is important, use the cluster endpoint for
read/write or general-purpose connections and the reader endpoint for read-only connections.
The writer and reader endpoints manage DB instance failover better than instance endpoints
do. Unlike the instance endpoints, the writer and reader endpoints automatically change
which DB instance they connect to if a DB instance in your cluster becomes unavailable. For
more information about cluster and reader endpoints, see [Cluster endpoints for Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Endpoints.Cluster.html) and [Reader endpoints for Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Endpoints.Reader.html).

If the primary DB instance of a DB cluster fails, Aurora automatically fails over to a
new primary DB instance. It does so by either promoting an existing Aurora Replica to a new
primary DB instance or creating a new primary DB instance. If a failover occurs, you can use
the cluster endpoint to reconnect to the newly promoted or created primary DB instance, or
use the reader endpoint to reconnect to one of the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster. During
a failover, the reader endpoint might direct connections to the new primary DB instance of a
DB cluster for a short time after an Aurora Replica is promoted to the new primary DB
instance.

If you design your own application logic to manage connections to instance endpoints,
you can manually or programmatically discover the resulting set of available DB instances in
the DB cluster. Use the [describe-db-clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-clusters.html) AWS CLI command or [DescribeDBClusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBClusters.html) RDS API operation to find the DB cluster and
reader endpoints, DB instances, whether DB instances are readers, and their promotion tiers.
You can then confirm their instance classes after failover and connect to an appropriate
instance endpoint.
