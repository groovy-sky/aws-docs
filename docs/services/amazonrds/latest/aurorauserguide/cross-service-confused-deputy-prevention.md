# Preventing cross-service confused deputy problems

The _confused deputy problem_ is a security issue where an entity that
doesn't have permission to perform an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform the
action. In AWS, cross-service impersonation can result in the confused deputy problem.

Cross-service impersonation can occur when one service (the _calling_
_service_) calls another service (the _called service_). The
calling service can be manipulated to use its permissions to act on another customer's resources
in a way that it shouldn't have permission to access. To prevent this, AWS provides tools that
can help you protect your data for all services with service principals that have been given
access to resources in your account. For more information, see [The confused deputy problem](../../../iam/latest/userguide/confused-deputy.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

To limit the permissions that Amazon RDS gives another service for a specific resource, we
recommend using the [`aws:SourceArn`](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-condition-keys.md#condition-keys-sourcearn) and [`aws:SourceAccount`](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-condition-keys.md#condition-keys-sourceaccount) global condition context keys in resource policies.

In some cases, the `aws:SourceArn` value doesn't contain the account ID, for
example when you use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an Amazon S3 bucket. In these cases, make
sure to use both global condition context keys to limit permissions. In some cases, you use both
global condition context keys and the `aws:SourceArn` value contains the account ID.
In these cases, make sure that the `aws:SourceAccount` value and the account in the
`aws:SourceArn` use the same account ID when they're used in the same policy
statement. If you want only one resource to be associated with the cross-service access, use
`aws:SourceArn`. If you want to allow any resource in the specified AWS account
to be associated with the cross-service use, use `aws:SourceAccount`.

Make sure that the value of `aws:SourceArn` is an ARN for an Amazon RDS resource type.
For more information, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in Amazon RDS](user-tagging-arn.md).

The most effective way to protect against the confused deputy problem is to use the
`aws:SourceArn` global condition context key with the full ARN of the resource. In
some cases, you might not know the full ARN of the resource or you might be specifying multiple
resources. In these cases, use the `aws:SourceArn` global context condition key with
wildcards ( `*`) for the unknown portions of the ARN. An example is
`arn:aws:rds:*:123456789012:*`.

The following example shows how you can use the `aws:SourceArn` and
`aws:SourceAccount` global condition context keys in Amazon RDS to prevent
the confused deputy problem.
