# Displaying volume status for an Aurora MySQL DB cluster

In Amazon Aurora, a DB cluster volume consists of a collection of logical blocks. Each of
these represents 10 gigabytes of allocated storage. These blocks are called
_protection groups_.

The data in each protection group is replicated across six physical storage devices,
called _storage nodes_. These storage nodes are allocated across
three Availability Zones (AZs) in the AWS Region where the DB cluster resides. In turn, each
storage node contains one or more logical blocks of data for the DB cluster volume. For
more information about protection groups and storage nodes, see
[Introducing the Aurora storage engine](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/introducing-the-aurora-storage-engine) on the AWS Database Blog.

You can simulate the failure of an entire storage node, or a single logical block of
data within a storage node. To do so, you use the `ALTER SYSTEM SIMULATE DISK
            FAILURE` fault injection statement. For the statement, you specify the index value of
a specific logical block of data or storage node. However, if you specify an index value
greater than the number of logical blocks of data or storage nodes used by the DB
cluster volume, the statement returns an error. For more information about fault injection
queries, see [Testing Amazon Aurora MySQL using fault injection queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Managing.FaultInjectionQueries.html).

You can avoid that error by using the `SHOW VOLUME STATUS` statement. The statement
returns two server status variables, `Disks` and `Nodes`. These
variables represent the total number of logical blocks of data and storage nodes,
respectively, for the DB cluster volume.

## Syntax

```sql

SHOW VOLUME STATUS
```

## Example

The following example illustrates a typical SHOW VOLUME STATUS result.

```sql

mysql> SHOW VOLUME STATUS;
+---------------+-------+
| Variable_name | Value |
+---------------+-------+
| Disks         | 96    |
| Nodes         | 74    |
+---------------+-------+

```
