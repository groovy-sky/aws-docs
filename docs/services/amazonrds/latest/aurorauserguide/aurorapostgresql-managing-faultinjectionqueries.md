# Testing Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL by using fault injection queries

You can test the fault tolerance of your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster by using fault
injection queries. Fault injection queries are issued as SQL commands to an Amazon Aurora
instance. Fault injection queries let you crash the instance so that you can test
failover and recovery. You can also simulate Aurora Replica failure, disk failure, and
disk congestion. Fault injection queries are supported by all available Aurora PostgreSQL
versions, as follows.

- Aurora PostgreSQL versions 12, 13, 14, and higher

- Aurora PostgreSQL version 11.7 and higher

- Aurora PostgreSQL version 10.11 and higher

- [Testing an Aurora Replica failure](#AuroraPostgreSQL.Managing.FaultInjectionQueries.ReplicaFailure)

- [Testing a disk failure](#AuroraPostgreSQL.Managing.FaultInjectionQueries.DiskFailure)

- [Testing disk congestion](#AuroraPostgreSQL.Managing.FaultInjectionQueries.DiskCongestion)

When a fault injection query specifies a crash, it forces a crash of the Aurora PostgreSQL
DB instance. The other fault injection queries result in simulations of failure events,
but don't cause the event to occur. When you submit a fault injection query, you also
specify an amount of time for the failure event simulation to occur.

You can submit a fault injection query to one of your Aurora Replica instances by
connecting to the endpoint for the Aurora Replica. For more information, see [Amazon Aurora endpoint connections](aurora-overview-endpoints.md).

## Testing an instance crash

You can force a crash of an Aurora PostgreSQL instance by using the fault injection
query function `aurora_inject_crash()`.

For this fault injection query, a failover does not occur. If you want to test a
failover, then you can choose the **Failover** instance action for
your DB cluster in the RDS console, or use the [failover-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/failover-db-cluster.md)
AWS CLI command or the [FailoverDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-failoverdbcluster.md) RDS API operation.

**Syntax**

```nohighlight

SELECT aurora_inject_crash ('instance' | 'dispatcher' | 'node');
```

###### Options

This fault injection query takes one of the following crash types. The crash
type is not case sensitive:

_'instance'_

A crash of the PostgreSQL-compatible database for the Amazon Aurora
instance is simulated.

_'dispatcher'_

A crash of the dispatcher on the primary instance for the Aurora DB
cluster is simulated. The _dispatcher_ writes updates
to the cluster volume for an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.

_'node'_

A crash of both the PostgreSQL-compatible database and the dispatcher
for the Amazon Aurora instance is simulated.

## Testing an Aurora Replica failure

You can simulate the failure of an Aurora Replica by using the fault injection
query function `aurora_inject_replica_failure()`.

An Aurora Replica failure blocks replication to the Aurora Replica or all Aurora
Replicas in the DB cluster by the specified percentage for the specified time
interval. When the time interval completes, the affected Aurora Replicas are
automatically synchronized with the primary instance.

**Syntax**

```nohighlight

SELECT aurora_inject_replica_failure(
   percentage_of_failure,
   time_interval,
   'replica_name'
);
```

###### Options

This fault injection query takes the following parameters:

_percentage\_of\_failure_

The percentage of replication to block during the failure event. This
value can be a double between 0 and 100. If you specify 0, then no
replication is blocked. If you specify 100, then all replication is
blocked.

_time\_interval_

The amount of time to simulate the Aurora Replica failure. The interval
is in seconds. For example, if the value is 20, the simulation runs for
20 seconds.

###### Note

Take care when specifying the time interval for your Aurora
Replica failure event. If you specify too long an interval, and your
writer instance writes a large amount of data during the failure
event, then your Aurora DB cluster might assume that your Aurora
Replica has crashed and replace it.

_replica\_name_

The Aurora Replica in which to inject the failure simulation. Specify
the name of an Aurora Replica to simulate a failure of the single Aurora
Replica. Specify an empty string to simulate failures for all Aurora
Replicas in the DB cluster.

To identify replica names, see the `server_id` column from
the `aurora_replica_status()` function. For example:

```nohighlight

postgres=> SELECT server_id FROM aurora_replica_status();
```

## Testing a disk failure

You can simulate a disk failure for an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster by using the fault
injection query function `aurora_inject_disk_failure()`.

During a disk failure simulation, the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster randomly marks disk
segments as faulting. Requests to those segments are blocked for the duration of the
simulation.

**Syntax**

```nohighlight

SELECT aurora_inject_disk_failure(
   percentage_of_failure,
   index,
   is_disk,
   time_interval
);
```

###### Options

This fault injection query takes the following parameters:

_percentage\_of\_failure_

The percentage of the disk to mark as faulting during the failure
event. This value can be a double between 0 and 100. If you specify 0,
then none of the disk is marked as faulting. If you specify 100, then
the entire disk is marked as faulting.

_index_

A specific logical block of data in which to simulate the failure
event. If you exceed the range of available logical blocks or storage
nodes data, you receive an error that tells you the maximum index value
that you can specify. To avoid this error, see [Displaying volume status for an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster](aurorapostgresql-managing-volumestatus.md).

_is\_disk_

Indicates whether the injection failure is to a logical block or a
storage node. Specifying true means injection failures are to a logical
block. Specifying false means injection failures are to a storage
node.

_time\_interval_

The amount of time to simulate the disk failure. The interval is in
seconds. For example, if the value is 20, the simulation runs for 20
seconds.

## Testing disk congestion

You can simulate a disk congestion for an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster by using the
fault injection query function `aurora_inject_disk_congestion()`.

During a disk congestion simulation, the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster randomly marks
disk segments as congested. Requests to those segments are delayed between the
specified minimum and maximum delay time for the duration of the simulation.

**Syntax**

```nohighlight

SELECT aurora_inject_disk_congestion(
   percentage_of_failure,
   index,
   is_disk,
   time_interval,
   minimum,
   maximum
);
```

###### Options

This fault injection query takes the following parameters:

_percentage\_of\_failure_

The percentage of the disk to mark as congested during the failure
event. This is a double value between 0 and 100. If you specify 0, then
none of the disk is marked as congested. If you specify 100, then the
entire disk is marked as congested.

_index_

A specific logical block of data or storage node to use to simulate
the failure event.

If you exceed the range of available logical blocks or storage nodes
of data, you receive an error that tells you the maximum index value
that you can specify. To avoid this error, see [Displaying volume status for an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster](aurorapostgresql-managing-volumestatus.md).

_is\_disk_

Indicates whether the injection failure is to a logical block or a
storage node. Specifying true means injection failures are to a logical
block. Specifying false means injection failures are to a storage
node.

_time\_interval_

The amount of time to simulate the disk congestion. The interval is in
seconds. For example, if the value is 20, the simulation runs for 20
seconds.

_minimum, maximum_

The minimum and maximum amount of congestion delay, in milliseconds.
Valid values range from 0.0 to 100.0 milliseconds. Disk segments marked
as congested are delayed for a random amount of time within the minimum
and maximum range for the duration of the simulation. The maximum value
must be greater than the minimum value.
