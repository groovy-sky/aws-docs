# Migrating data from an RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance to an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster using an Aurora read replica

You can use an RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance as the basis for a new Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster by using an Aurora
read replica for the migration process. The Aurora read replica option is available only for migrating within the same AWS Region and
account, and it's available only if the Region offers a compatible version of Aurora PostgreSQL for your
RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. By _compatible_, we mean that
the Aurora PostgreSQL version is the same as the RDS for PostgreSQL version, or that it is a higher minor version in the same major version
family.

For example, to use this technique to migrate an RDS for PostgreSQL 11.14 DB instance, the Region must offer Aurora PostgreSQL version 11.14
or a higher minor version in the PostgreSQL version 11 family.

## Overview of migrating data by using an Aurora read replica

Migrating from an RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance to an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster is a
multistep procedure. First, you create an Aurora read replica of your source
RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. That starts a replication process from your RDS for PostgreSQL
DB instance to a special-purpose DB cluster known as a _Replica cluster_. The Replica cluster
consists solely of an Aurora read replica (a reader instance).

###### Note

It can take several hours per terabyte of data for the migration to complete.

###### Promoting an Aurora PostgreSQL Replica

After you create an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster, follow these steps to promote the Aurora Replica:

1. Stop all database write workload on the source RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance.

2. Get the current `WAL LSN` from the source RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance:

```nohighlight

SELECT pg_current_wal_lsn();
pg_current_wal_lsn
   --------------------
0/F0000318
(1 row)

```

3. On the Aurora PostgreSQL Replica cluster, check that the replayed LSN is greater than the LSN from step 2:

```nohighlight

SELECT pg_last_wal_replay_lsn();
pg_last_wal_replay_lsn
   ------------------------
0/F0000400
(1 row)

```

Alternatively, you can use the following query on the source RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance:

```nohighlight

SELECT restart_lsn FROM pg_replication_slots;

```

4. Promote the Aurora PostgreSQL Replica cluster.

When the replication stops, the replica cluster is promoted to a standalone Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster, and the reader is promoted to
    writer instance for the cluster. At this point, you can add instances to the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to size it according to
    your use case. If you no longer need the original RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance, you can delete it.

You can't create an Aurora read replica if your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance
already has an Aurora read replica or if it has a cross-Region read replica.

## Preparing to migrate data by using an Aurora read replica

###### Note

When preparing to migrate data to Aurora PostgreSQL, it's important to identify and handle
unlogged tables appropriately. For more information, see [Handling unlogged tables during migration](aurora-postgresql-unlogged-tables.md#aurora-postgresql-unlogged-tables-migration).

During the migration process using Aurora read replica, updates made to the source RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance are
asynchronously replicated to the Aurora read replica of the Replica cluster. The process
uses PostgreSQL's native streaming replication functionality which stores write-ahead logs (WAL) segments
on the source instance. Before starting this migration process, make sure
that your instance has sufficient storage capacity by checking values for the metrics listed in the table.

MetricDescription

`FreeStorageSpace`

The available storage space.

Units: Bytes

`OldestReplicationSlotLag`

The size of the lag for WAL data in the replica that is lagging the most.

Units: Megabytes

`RDSToAuroraPostgreSQLReplicaLag`

The amount of time in seconds that an Aurora PostgreSQL DB
cluster lags behind the source RDS DB instance.

`TransactionLogsDiskUsage`

The disk space used by the transaction logs.

Units: Megabytes

For more information about monitoring your RDS instance, see
[Monitoring](../userguide/chap-monitoring.md) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_.

## Creating an Aurora read replica

You can create an Aurora read replica for an RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance by using
the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI. The option to create an Aurora read replica using the
AWS Management Console is available only if the AWS Region offers a compatible Aurora PostgreSQL version. That is, it's
available only if there's an Aurora PostgreSQL version that is the same as the
RDS for PostgreSQL version or a higher minor version in the same major version
family.

###### To create an Aurora read replica from a source PostgreSQL DB instance

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

3. Choose the RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance that you want to use as the
    source for your Aurora read replica. For **Actions**, choose **Create Aurora**
**read replica**. If this choice doesn't display, it means that
    a compatible Aurora PostgreSQL version isn't available in the Region.

![Create Aurora read replica](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/Aurorapgres-migrate.png)

4. On the Create Aurora read replica settings page, you configure
    the properties for the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster as shown in the
    following table. The Replica DB cluster
    is created from a snapshot of the source DB instance using the
    same 'master' user name and password as the source, so
    you can't change these at this time.

OptionDescription

**DB instance class**

Choose a DB instance class that meets the processing and memory requirements primary
instance in the DB cluster. For more information, see [Amazon AuroraDB instance classes](concepts-dbinstanceclass.md).

**Multi-AZ deployment**

Not available during the migration

**DB instance identifier**

Enter the name that you want to give to the DB
instance. This identifier is used in the endpoint
address for the primary instance of the new DB
cluster.

The DB instance identifier has the following
constraints:

- It must contain 1–63 alphanumeric
characters or hyphens.

- Its first character must be a letter.

- It can't end with a hyphen or contain two
consecutive hyphens.

- It must be unique for all DB instances for
each AWS account, for each AWS Region.

**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**

Choose the VPC to host the DB cluster. Choose
**Create new VPC** to have Amazon RDS
create a VPC for you. For more information, see
[DB cluster prerequisites](aurora-createinstance.md#Aurora.CreateInstance.Prerequisites).

**DB subnet group**

Choose the DB subnet group to use for the DB
cluster. Choose **Create new DB Subnet**
**Group** to have Amazon RDS create a DB subnet
group for you. For more information, see [DB cluster prerequisites](aurora-createinstance.md#Aurora.CreateInstance.Prerequisites).

**Public accessibility**

Choose **Yes** to give the DB cluster
a public IP address; otherwise, choose
**No**. The instances in your DB cluster
can be a mix of both public and private DB
instances. For more information about hiding
instances from public access, see [Hiding a DB cluster in a VPC from the internet](user-vpc-workingwithrdsinstanceinavpc.md#USER_VPC.Hiding).

**Availability zone**

Determine if you want to specify a particular
Availability Zone. For more information about
Availability Zones, see [Regions and Availability Zones](concepts-regionsandavailabilityzones.md).

**VPC security groups**

Choose one or more VPC security groups to
secure network access to the DB cluster. Choose
**Create new VPC security group**
to have Amazon RDS create a VPC security group for you.
For more information, see [DB cluster prerequisites](aurora-createinstance.md#Aurora.CreateInstance.Prerequisites).

**Database port**

Specify the port for applications and
utilities to use to access the database. Aurora
PostgreSQL DB clusters default to the default
PostgreSQL port, 5432. Firewalls at some companies
block connections to this port. If your company
firewall blocks the default port, choose another
port for the new DB cluster.

**DB parameter group**

Choose a DB parameter group for the Aurora
PostgreSQL DB cluster. Aurora has a default DB
parameter group you can use, or you can create your
own DB parameter group. For more information about
DB parameter groups, see [Parameter groups for Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups.md).

**DB cluster parameter group**

Choose a DB cluster parameter group for the
Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster. Aurora has a default DB
cluster parameter group you can use, or you can
create your own DB cluster parameter group. For more
information about DB cluster parameter groups, see
[Parameter groups for Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups.md).

**Encryption**

Choose **Enable encryption**
for your new Aurora DB cluster to be encrypted at
rest. If you choose **Enable**
**encryption**, also choose a KMS key
as the **AWS KMS key** value.

**Priority**

Choose a failover priority for the DB cluster.
If you don't choose a value, the default is
**tier-1**. This priority
determines the order in which Aurora Replicas are
promoted when recovering from a primary instance
failure. For more information, see [Fault tolerance for an Aurora DB cluster](concepts-aurorahighavailability.md#Aurora.Managing.FaultTolerance).

**Backup retention period**

Choose the length of time, 1–35 days,
for Aurora to retain backup copies of the
database. Backup copies can be used for
point-in-time restores (PITR) of your database down
to the second.

**Enhanced monitoring**

Choose **Enable enhanced**
**monitoring** to enable gathering metrics
in real time for the operating system that your DB
cluster runs on. For more information, see [Monitoring OS metrics with Enhanced Monitoring](user-monitoring-os.md).

**Monitoring**
**Role**

Only available if you chose **Enable**
**enhanced monitoring**. The AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM) role to use for Enhanced Monitoring. For
more information, see [Setting up and enabling Enhanced Monitoring](user-monitoring-os-enabling.md).

**Granularity**

Only available if you chose **Enable**
**enhanced monitoring**. Set the interval,
in seconds, between when metrics are collected for
your DB cluster.

**Auto minor version upgrade**

Choose **Yes** to enable your
Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to receive minor PostgreSQL
DB engine version upgrades automatically when they
become available.

The **Auto minor version upgrade** option only applies to upgrades
to PostgreSQL minor engine versions for your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster. It doesn't
apply to regular patches applied to maintain system stability.

**Maintenance window**

Choose the weekly time range during which
system maintenance can occur.

5. Choose **Create read replica**.

To create an Aurora read replica from a source RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance by using the AWS CLI,
you first use the [**create-db-cluster**](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster.md) CLI command to create an empty Aurora DB cluster. Once the
DB cluster exists, you then use the [**create-db-instance**](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.md) command to create the primary
instance for your DB cluster. The primary instance is the first instance that's created in an Aurora DB cluster. In this
case, it's created initially as an Aurora read replica of your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance.
When the process concludes, your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance has effectively been migrated to an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.

You don't need to specify the main user account (typically, `postgres`), its password,
or the database name. The Aurora read replica obtains these automatically from
the source RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance that you identify when you invoke the AWS CLI commands.

You do need to specify the engine version to use for the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster and the DB instance. The version you specify
should match the source RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. If the source RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance is encrypted, you need to also
specify encryption for the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster primary instance. Migrating
an encrypted instance to an unencrypted Aurora DB cluster isn't supported.

The following examples create an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster named `my-new-aurora-cluster`
that's going to use an unencrypted RDS DB source instance. You first create the Aurora PostgreSQL
DB cluster by calling the [`create-db-cluster`](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster.md) CLI command. The example shows how to use
the optional `--storage-encrypted ` parameter to specify that the DB cluster should
be encrypted. Because the source DB isn't encrypted, the `--kms-key-id` is used to specify the key to use.
For more information about required and optional parameters, see the list following the example.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster  \
    --db-cluster-identifier my-new-aurora-cluster \
    --db-subnet-group-name my-db-subnet
    --vpc-security-group-ids sg-11111111
    --engine aurora-postgresql \
    --engine-version same-as-your-rds-instance-version \
    --replication-source-identifier arn:aws:rds:aws-region:111122223333:db/rpg-source-db \
    --storage-encrypted \
    --kms-key-id arn:aws:kms:aws-region:111122223333:key/11111111-2222-3333-444444444444

```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster  ^
    --db-cluster-identifier my-new-aurora-cluster ^
    --db-subnet-group-name my-db-subnet ^
    --vpc-security-group-ids sg-11111111 ^
    --engine aurora-postgresql ^
    --engine-version same-as-your-rds-instance-version ^
    --replication-source-identifier arn:aws:rds:aws-region:111122223333:db/rpg-source-db ^
    --storage-encrypted ^
    --kms-key-id arn:aws:kms:aws-region:111122223333:key/11111111-2222-3333-444444444444
```

In the following list you can find more information about some of the options shown in the example. Unless otherwise specified,
these parameters are required.

- `--db-cluster-identifier` – You need to give your new Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster a name.

- `--db-subnet-group-name` – Create your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster in the same DB subnet as the source DB instance.

- `--vpc-security-group-ids` – Specify the security group for your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.

- `--engine-version` – Specify the version to use for the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.
This should be the same as or a higher minor version than the version used by your source RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance.

- `--replication-source-identifier` – Identify your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance using its
Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For more information about Amazon RDS ARNs, see [Amazon Relational Database Service\
(Amazon RDS)](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.md#arn-syntax-rds) in the _AWS General Reference_. of your DB cluster.

- `--storage-encrypted` – Optional. Use only when needed to specify encryption as follows:

- Use this parameter when the source DB instance has encrypted storage. The call to
[`create-db-cluster`](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster.md) fails if
you don't use this parameter with a source DB instance that has
encrypted storage. If you want to use a different key for the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster than the key
used by the source DB instance, you need to also specify the `--kms-key-id`.

- Use if the source DB instance's storage is unencrypted but you want the Aurora PostgreSQL
DB cluster to use encryption. If so, you also need to identify the encryption key to use with the
`--kms-key-id` parameter.

- `--kms-key-id` – Optional. When used, you can specify the key to use for storage encryption ( `--storage-encrypted`)
by using the key's ARN, ID, alias ARN, or its alias name. This parameter is needed only for the following situations:

- To choose a different key for the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster than that used by the source DB instance.

- To create an encrypted cluster from an unencrypted source. In this case, you need to specify the key that Aurora PostgreSQL
should use for encryption.

After creating the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster, you then create the primary instance
by using the [`create-db-instance`](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.md)
CLI command, as shown in the following:

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance \
    --db-cluster-identifier my-new-aurora-cluster \
    --db-instance-class db.x2g.16xlarge \
    --db-instance-identifier rpg-for-migration \
    --engine aurora-postgresql
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance ^
    --db-cluster-identifier my-new-aurora-cluster ^
    --db-instance-class db.x2g.16xlarge ^
    --db-instance-identifier rpg-for-migration ^
    --engine aurora-postgresql
```

In the following list, you can find more information about some of the options shown in the example.

- `--db-cluster-identifier` – Specify the name of the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster that you created with the
[`create-db-instance`](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.md) command in the previous steps.

- `--db-instance-class` – The name of the DB instance class to use for your primary
instance, such as `db.r4.xlarge`, `db.t4g.medium`,
`db.x2g.16xlarge`, and so on.
For a list of available DB instance classes, see
[DB instance class types](concepts-dbinstanceclass-types.md).

- `--db-instance-identifier` – Specify the name to give your primary instance.

- `--engine aurora-postgresql` – Specify `aurora-postgresql` for the engine.

To create an Aurora read replica from a source RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance, first use
the RDS API operation [`CreateDBCluster`](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbcluster.md) to create a new Aurora DB cluster for
the Aurora read replica that gets created from your source RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance.
When the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster is available, you then use the [`CreateDBInstance`](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbinstance.md) to create the primary instance for
the Aurora DB cluster.

You don't need to specify the main user account (typically, `postgres`), its password,
or the database name. The Aurora read replica obtains these automatically from
the source RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance specified with `ReplicationSourceIdentifier`.

You do need to specify the engine version to use for the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster and the DB instance. The version you specify
should match the source RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. If the source RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance is encrypted, you need to also
specify encryption for the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster primary instance. Migrating
an encrypted instance to an unencrypted Aurora DB cluster isn't supported.

To create the Aurora DB cluster for the Aurora read replica, use the RDS API operation [`CreateDBCluster`](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbcluster.md) with the following parameters:

- `DBClusterIdentifier` – The name of the DB cluster to create.

- `DBSubnetGroupName` – The name of the DB subnet group to associate with this DB
cluster.

- `Engine=aurora-postgresql` – The name of the engine to use.

- `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the source PostgreSQL DB
instance. For more information about Amazon RDS ARNs, see [Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.md#arn-syntax-rds) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference._ If `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` identifies
an encrypted source, Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key unless you specify a
different key using the `KmsKeyId` option.

- `VpcSecurityGroupIds` – The list of Amazon EC2 VPC security groups to associate with this DB
cluster.

- `StorageEncrypted` – Indicates that the DB cluster is encrypted. When you use this
parameter without also specifying the `ReplicationSourceIdentifier`, Amazon RDS uses
your default KMS key.

- `KmsKeyId` – The key for an encrypted cluster. When used, you can specify the key
to use for storage encryption by using the key's ARN, ID, alias ARN, or its alias name.

For more information, see [`CreateDBCluster`](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbcluster.md)
in the _Amazon RDS API Reference_.

Once the Aurora DB cluster is available, you can then create a primary instance for it by using the RDS API
operation [`CreateDBInstance`](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbinstance.md) with the following
parameters:

- `DBClusterIdentifier` – The name of your DB cluster.

- `DBInstanceClass` – The name of the DB instance class to use for your primary
instance.

- `DBInstanceIdentifier` – The name of your primary instance.

- `Engine=aurora-postgresql` – The name of the engine to use.

For more information, see [`CreateDBInstance`](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbinstance.md)
in the _Amazon RDS API Reference_.

## Promoting an Aurora read replica

The migration to Aurora PostgreSQL isn't complete until you promote the Replica cluster, so don't delete
the RDS for PostgreSQL source DB instance just yet.

Before promoting the Replica cluster, make sure that the RDS for PostgreSQL DB
instance doesn't have any in-process transactions or other activity writing to
the database. When the replica lag on the Aurora read replica reaches zero (0), you
can promote the Replica cluster. For more information about monitoring replica lag,
see [Monitoring Aurora PostgreSQL replication](aurorapostgresql-replication.md#AuroraPostgreSQL.Replication.Monitoring) and [Instance-level metrics for Amazon Aurora](aurora-auroramonitoring-metrics.md#Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Monitoring.Metrics.instances).

###### To promote an Aurora read replica to an Aurora DB cluster

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

3. Choose the Replica cluster.

![Promote a Replica cluster to full Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/Aurorapgres-migrate-2.png)

4. For **Actions**, choose **Promote**. This may take a few minutes and can cause downtime.

When the process completes, the Aurora Replica cluster is a Regional Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster, with a Writer instance containing
the data from the RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance.

To promote an Aurora read replica to a stand-alone DB cluster, use the
[**promote-read-replica-db-cluster**](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/promote-read-replica-db-cluster.md) AWS CLI
command.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds promote-read-replica-db-cluster \
    --db-cluster-identifier myreadreplicacluster
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds promote-read-replica-db-cluster ^
    --db-cluster-identifier myreadreplicacluster
```

To promote an Aurora read replica to a stand-alone DB cluster, use the
RDS API operation [PromoteReadReplicaDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-promotereadreplicadbcluster.md).

After you promote the Replica cluster, you can confirm that the promotion has
completed by checking the event log, as follows.

###### To confirm that the Aurora Replica cluster was promoted

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Events**.

3. On the **Events** page, find the name of your
    cluster in the **Source** list. Each event has a source, type,
    time, and message. You can see all events that have occurred in your
    AWS Region for your account. A successful promotion generates the following
    message.

```nohighlight

Promoted Read Replica cluster to a stand-alone database cluster.
```

After promotion is complete, the source RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance and the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster are unlinked.
You can direct your client applications to the endpoint for the Aurora read replica. For more information on the Aurora endpoints, see [Amazon Aurora endpoint connections](aurora-overview-endpoints.md).
At this point, you can safely delete the DB instance.
