# Publishing Aurora PostgreSQL logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs

You can configure your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to export log data to Amazon CloudWatch Logs on a
regular basis. When you do so, events from your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster's PostgreSQL
log are automatically _published_ to Amazon CloudWatch, as Amazon CloudWatch Logs. In CloudWatch, you
can find the exported log data in a _Log group_ for your Aurora PostgreSQL DB
cluster. The log group contains one or more _log streams_ that contain
the events from the PostgreSQL log from each instance in the cluster.

Publishing the logs to CloudWatch Logs allows you to keep your cluster's PostgreSQL log records
in highly durable storage. With the log data available in CloudWatch Logs, you can evaluate and
improve your cluster's operations. You can also use CloudWatch to create alarms and view
metrics. To learn more, see [Monitoring log events in Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.CloudWatch.Monitor.html).

###### Note

Publishing your PostgreSQL logs to CloudWatch Logs consumes storage, and
you incur charges for that storage. Be sure to delete any CloudWatch Logs
that you no longer need.

Turning the export log option off for an existing Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster doesn't
affect any data that's already held in CloudWatch Logs. Existing logs remain available in
CloudWatch Logs based on your log retention settings. To learn more about CloudWatch Logs, see [What\
is Amazon CloudWatch Logs?](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/whatiscloudwatchlogs.md)
