# Monitoring parallel query for Aurora MySQL

If your Aurora MySQL cluster uses parallel query, you might see an increase in `VolumeReadIOPS` values.
Parallel queries don't use the buffer pool. Thus, although the queries are fast, this optimized processing
can result in an increase in read operations and associated charges.

In addition to the Amazon CloudWatch metrics described in
[Viewing metrics in the Amazon RDS console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_Monitoring.html), Aurora provides other global status
variables. You can use these global status variables to help monitor parallel query execution. They can give you
insights into why the optimizer might use or not use parallel query in a given situation. To access these
variables, you can use the
`SHOW GLOBAL STATUS`
command. You can also find these variables listed following.

A parallel query session isn't necessarily a one-to-one mapping with the queries performed by the database. For example,
suppose that your query plan has two steps that use parallel query. In that case, the query involves two
parallel sessions and the counters for requests attempted and requests successful are incremented by two.

When you experiment with parallel query by issuing `EXPLAIN` statements,
expect to see increases in the counters designated as "not chosen" even though the
queries aren't actually running. When you work with parallel query in production, you can
check if the "not chosen" counters are increasing faster than you expect. At this
point, you can adjust so that parallel query runs for the queries that you expect. To do so,
you can change your cluster settings, query mix, DB instances where parallel query is turned
on, and so on.

These counters are tracked at the DB instance level. When you connect to a different endpoint, you might
see different metrics because each DB instance runs its own set of parallel queries. You might also see
different metrics when the reader endpoint connects to a different DB instance for each session.

NameDescription

`Aurora_pq_bytes_returned`

The number of bytes for the tuple data structures transmitted to the head node during parallel
queries. Divide by 16,384 to compare against `Aurora_pq_pages_pushed_down`.

`Aurora_pq_max_concurrent_requests`

The maximum number of parallel query sessions that can run concurrently on this Aurora DB instance.
This is a fixed number that depends on the AWS DB instance class.

`Aurora_pq_pages_pushed_down`

The number of data pages (each with a fixed size of 16 KiB) where parallel query avoided a network
transmission to the head node.

`Aurora_pq_request_attempted`

The number of parallel query sessions requested. This value might represent more than one session per query, depending
on SQL constructs such as subqueries and joins.

`Aurora_pq_request_executed`

The number of parallel query sessions run successfully.

`Aurora_pq_request_failed`

The number of parallel query sessions that returned an error to the client. In some cases, a request for a parallel
query might fail, for example due to a problem in the storage layer. In these cases, the query part that failed is
retried using the nonparallel query mechanism. If the retried query also fails, an error is returned to the client and
this counter is incremented.

`Aurora_pq_request_in_progress`

The number of parallel query sessions currently in progress. This number applies to the particular
Aurora DB instance that you are connected to, not the entire Aurora DB cluster. To see if a DB instance
is close to its concurrency limit, compare this value to
`Aurora_pq_max_concurrent_requests`.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen`

The number of times parallel query wasn't chosen to satisfy a query. This value is the sum of several other more
granular counters. An `EXPLAIN` statement can increment this counter even though the query isn't
actually performed.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_below_min_rows`

The number of times parallel query wasn't chosen due to the number of rows in the table. An `EXPLAIN`
statement can increment this counter even though the query isn't actually performed.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_column_bit`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because of an
unsupported data type in the list of projected columns.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_column_geometry`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the table
has columns with the `GEOMETRY` data type. For information about Aurora MySQL versions that
remove this limitation, see [Upgrading parallel query clusters to Aurora MySQL version 3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-mysql-parallel-query-optimizing.html#aurora-mysql-parallel-query-upgrade-pqv2).

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_column_lob`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the table
has columns with a `LOB` data type, or `VARCHAR` columns that are stored
externally due to the declared length. For information about Aurora MySQL versions that remove this
limitation, see [Upgrading parallel query clusters to Aurora MySQL version 3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-mysql-parallel-query-optimizing.html#aurora-mysql-parallel-query-upgrade-pqv2).

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_column_virtual`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the table
contains a virtual column.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_custom_charset`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the table
has columns with a custom character set.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_fast_ddl`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the table
is currently being altered by a fast DDL `ALTER` statement.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_few_pages_outside_buffer_pool`

The number of times parallel query wasn't chosen, even though less than 95 percent of the table
data was in the buffer pool, because there wasn't enough unbuffered table data to make parallel
query worthwhile.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_full_text_index`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the table
has full-text indexes.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_high_buffer_pool_pct`

The number of times parallel query wasn't chosen because a high percentage of the table data
(currently, greater than 95 percent) was already in the buffer pool. In these cases, the optimizer
determines that reading the data from the buffer pool is more efficient. An `EXPLAIN`
statement can increment this counter even though the query isn't actually performed.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_index_hint`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the query
includes an index hint.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_innodb_table_format`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the table
uses an unsupported InnoDB row format. Aurora parallel query only applies to the `COMPACT`,
`REDUNDANT`, and `DYNAMIC` row formats.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_long_trx`

The number of parallel query requests that used the nonparallel query processing path, due to the
query being started inside a long-running transaction. An `EXPLAIN` statement can increment
this counter even though the query isn't actually performed.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_no_where_clause`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the query
doesn't include any `WHERE` clause.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_range_scan`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the query
uses a range scan on an index.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_row_length_too_long`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the total
combined length of all the columns is too long.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_small_table`

The number of times parallel query wasn't chosen due to the overall size of the table, as determined by number of
rows and average row length. An `EXPLAIN` statement can increment this counter even though the query
isn't actually performed.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_temporary_table`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the query
refers to temporary tables that use the unsupported `MyISAM` or `memory` table
types.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_tx_isolation`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because query
uses an unsupported transaction isolation level. On reader DB instances, parallel query only applies to
the `REPEATABLE READ` and `READ COMMITTED` isolation levels.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_update_delete_stmts`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the query
is part of an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_unsupported_access`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the
`WHERE` clause doesn't meet the criteria for parallel query. This result can occur
if the query doesn't require a data-intensive scan, or if the query is a `DELETE` or
`UPDATE` statement.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_unsupported_storage_type`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the
Aurora MySQL DB cluster isn't using a supported Aurora cluster storage configuration. This parameter is
available in Aurora MySQL version 3.04 and higher. For more information, see [Limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-mysql-parallel-query.html#aurora-mysql-parallel-query-limitations).

`Aurora_pq_request_throttled`

The number of times parallel query wasn't chosen due to the maximum number of concurrent parallel queries already
running on a particular Aurora DB instance.
