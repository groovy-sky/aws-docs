# Auto migrating databases to Amazon Aurora using AWS Database Migration Service

You can use the Aurora console to migrate a database from an EC2, on-prem or other cloud provider instance to
Aurora.
AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is used for this.
For more information about it, see
[What is AWS Database Migration Service?](../../../dms/latest/userguide/welcome.md)
in the _AWS Database Migration Service User Guide_.

To begin the migration, you must create an equivalent AuroraDB cluster.
After you create your target database, you can import your source into it.
For source databases smaller than 1TiB, this migration action reduces
the time and resources required to migrate your data into Aurora
.

## Overview

The Aurora console allows you to migrate EC2, on-prem or other cloud provider database
into equivalent Aurora database. You must create an
Aurora database to enable migration from the console.

###### Note

For the databases to be equivalent, they must have the same database engine and compatible engine versions.

This approach can be used for the following database engines:

- MySQL

- PostgreSQL

The migration process involves the following steps:

- Create an equivalent database in Aurora.
Then, set up a proper network between source and target.
For EC2 instances in the same region, account, and VPC, network setup can be skipped.
For more information, see
[Setting up a network](../../../dms/latest/userguide/dm-network.md)
in the _AWS Database Migration Service User Guide_. For instructions on creating your database, see
[Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-createinstance.md).

- Choose the type of replication for your database:

- **Full load migration** – Aurora copies the complete source database
to the target database, creating new tables in the target when necessary.

###### Note

This option requires downtime. Your target Aurora database will be unavailable to applications during the migration process.

- **Full load and change data capture (CDC) migration** – Similar to full load migration,
with this option, Aurora
copies over the complete source database to the target database. However, after the full load migration,
Aurora applies any captured changes in the source
to the target database. Change data capture collects changes to the database logs by using the database engine's native API.

###### Note

This option requires downtime. Your target Aurora database will be unavailable to applications during the migration process.

- **Change data capture (CDC)** – Use this option to keep your target database available through the migration.
Aurora migrates ongoing changes in your source database to the target database.

- Aurora creates the
necessary resources to facilitate the migration.
Once Aurora
creates the required resources, it notifies you about the resources
created and allows you to initiate the data transfer.

The time required to complete the migration depends on the
type of replication and the size of the source database.

## Prerequisites

- [Setting up a network](../../../dms/latest/userguide/dm-network.md)
(for EC2s in the same region, account and VPC, it can be skipped)

- Setting up source and target databases

- **MySQL**

Please follow the following basic prerequisites for your source database:

- [Using MySQL as a source](../../../dms/latest/userguide/dm-data-providers-source-mysql.md)

Please follow the following basic prerequisites for your target database:

- [Using MySQL as a target](../../../dms/latest/userguide/dm-data-providers-target-mysql.md)

Additionally when migrating from a MySQL source database, your Aurora account must have the Replication Admin role.
You must also have the proper privileges applied for that role.

- **PostgreSQL**

Please follow the following prerequisites for your source database:

- [Using PostgreSQL as a source](../../../dms/latest/userguide/dm-data-providers-source-postgresql.md)

Please follow the following prerequisites for your target database:

- [Using PostgreSQL as a target](../../../dms/latest/userguide/dm-data-providers-target-postgresql.md)

###### Note

Some AWS DMS transactions are idle for some time before the DMS engine uses
them again. By using the parameter
`idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` in PostgreSQL versions
9.6 and higher, you can cause idle transactions to time out and fail.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply to the auto-migrate process:

- Your target database status must be **Available** to begin source database migration.

- You can migrate your source database only to a database:

- that is not any of the following:

- Aurora global database

- Aurora Limitless database

- Aurora Serverless v1

- that uses a supported version of MySQL or PostgreSQL as listed
[here](../../../dms/latest/userguide/chap-introduction-sources.md#CHAP_Introduction.Sources.HomogeneousDataMigrations)

- [Limitations of DMS](../../../dms/latest/userguide/data-migrations.md#data-migrations-limitations)

###### Note

Although underlying AWS DMS tool supports selection rules for certain migration scenarios, the auto-migrating databases to
Aurora feature does not.
