# Amazon Aurora DB clusters

An Amazon Aurora _DB cluster_ consists of one or more DB instances and a
cluster volume that manages the data for those DB instances. An Aurora _cluster_
_volume_ is a virtual database storage volume that spans multiple Availability
Zones, with each Availability Zone having a copy of the DB cluster data. Two types of DB
instances make up an Aurora DB cluster:

- **Primary (writer) DB instance** – Supports read
and write operations, and performs all of the data modifications to the cluster volume.
Each Aurora DB cluster has one primary DB instance.

- **Aurora Replica (reader DB instance)**– Connects
to the same storage volume as the primary DB instance but supports only read operations.
Each Aurora DB cluster can have up to 15 Aurora Replicas in addition to the
primary DB instance. Maintain high availability by locating Aurora Replicas in separate
Availability Zones. Aurora automatically fails over to an Aurora Replica in case the primary
DB instance becomes unavailable. You can specify the failover priority for Aurora Replicas.
Aurora Replicas can also offload read workloads from the primary DB instance.

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the cluster volume, the writer
DB instance, and reader DB instances in an Aurora DB cluster.

###### Note

The preceding information applies to all Aurora DB clusters—provisioned, parallel
query, Aurora Global Database, Aurora Serverless, Aurora MySQL-Compatible, and Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible.

The Aurora DB cluster illustrates the separation of compute capacity and storage. For example,
an Aurora configuration with only a single DB instance is still a cluster, because the
underlying storage volume involves multiple storage nodes distributed across multiple
Availability Zones (AZs).

Input/output (I/O) operations in Aurora DB clusters are counted the same way, regardless of
whether they're on a writer or reader DB instance. For more information, see [Storage configurations for Amazon Aurora DB clusters](aurora-overview-storagereliability.md#aurora-storage-type).
