# Creating an Aurora DB cluster or a global cluster with Amazon RDS Extended Support

When you create an Aurora DB cluster or a global cluster, select **Enable**
**RDS Extended Support** in the console, or use the Extended Support option in the AWS CLI or the
parameter in the RDS API. When you enroll an Aurora DB cluster or a global cluster in
Amazon RDS Extended Support, it is permanently enrolled in RDS Extended Support for the life of the Aurora DB cluster or
global cluster.

If you use the console, you must select **Enable RDS Extended Support**. The
setting isn't selected by default.

If you use the AWS CLI or the RDS API and don't specify the RDS Extended Support setting, Amazon RDS
defaults to enabling RDS Extended Support. When you automate by using [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-rds-dbinstance.html#aws-resource-rds-dbinstance-return-values:~:text=EngineLifecycleSupport) or other services, this default behavior maintains the availability of
your database past the Aurora end of standard support date.

You can prevent enrollment in RDS Extended Support by using the [AWS CLI](#extended-support-creating-db-instance-create-cli) or the [RDS API](#extended-support-creating-db-instance-create-api) to create
an Aurora DB cluster or a global cluster.

## RDS Extended Support behavior

The following table summarizes what happens when a major engine version reaches the
Aurora
end of standard support.

RDS Extended Support status\*Behavior

Enabled

Amazon RDS charges you for RDS Extended Support.

Disabled

Amazon RDS upgrades your  Aurora DB cluster or global
cluster to a supported engine version. This upgrade
takes place on or shortly after the Aurora end of
standard support date.

\\* In the RDS console, the RDS Extended Support status appears as Yes or No. In the AWS CLI or
RDS API, the RDS Extended Support status appears as `open-source-rds-extended-support`
or `open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled`.

## Considerations for RDS Extended Support

Before creating an Aurora DB cluster or a global cluster, consider the following
items:

- _After_ the Aurora end of standard
support date has passed, you can prevent the creation of a new Aurora DB cluster or a new global cluster and avoid
RDS Extended Support charges. To do this, use the AWS CLI or the RDS API. In the AWS CLI,
specify `open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled` for the
`--engine-lifecycle-support` option. In the RDS API, specify
`open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled` for the
`LifeCycleSupport` parameter. If you specify
`open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled` and the Aurora
end of standard support date has passed, creating an Aurora DB cluster or a
global cluster will always fail.

- RDS Extended Support is set at the cluster level. Members of a cluster will always have
the same setting for RDS Extended Support in the RDS console,
`--engine-lifecycle-support` in the AWS CLI, and
`EngineLifecycleSupport` in the RDS API.

## Create an Aurora DB cluster or a global cluster with RDS Extended Support

You can create an Aurora DB cluster or a global cluster with an RDS Extended Support version
using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

When you create an Aurora DB cluster or a global
cluster, in the **Engine options** section, select
**Enable RDS Extended Support**. This setting isn't selected by
default.

The following image shows the **Enable RDS Extended Support**
setting:

![The Enable RDS Extended Support setting in the Engine options section.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/extended-support-enable.png)

When you run the [create-db-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster.html) or [create-global-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-global-cluster.html) AWS CLI command,
select RDS Extended Support by specifying `open-source-rds-extended-support`
for the `--engine-lifecycle-support` option. By default, this option
is set to `open-source-rds-extended-support`.

To prevent the creation of a new Aurora DB cluster or a global
cluster after the Aurora end of standard support date, specify
`open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled` for the
`--engine-lifecycle-support` option. By doing so, you will avoid
any associated RDS Extended Support charges.

When you use the [CreateDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbcluster.md) or [CreateGlobalCluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateGlobalCluster.html)
Amazon RDS API
operation, select RDS Extended Support by setting the `EngineLifecycleSupport`
parameter to `open-source-rds-extended-support`. By default, this
parameter is set to `open-source-rds-extended-support`.

To prevent the creation of a new Aurora DB cluster or a global
cluster after the Aurora end of standard support date, specify
`open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled` for the
`EngineLifecycleSupport` parameter. By doing so, you will avoid
any associated RDS Extended Support charges.

For more information, see the following topics:

- To create an Aurora DB cluster, follow the instructions for your DB engine in [Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-createinstance.md).

- To create a global cluster, follow the instructions for your DB engine in
[Creating an Amazon Aurora global database](aurora-global-database-creating.md).
