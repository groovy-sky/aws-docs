## Amazon Aurora MySQL performance enhancements

Amazon Aurora includes performance enhancements to support the diverse needs of
high-end commercial databases.

## Amazon Aurora MySQL and spatial data

The following list summarizes the main Aurora MySQL spatial features and explains how they correspond to spatial features in
MySQL:

- Aurora MySQL version 2 supports the same spatial data types and spatial relation functions as MySQL 5.7. For more
information about these data types and functions, see [Spatial Data Types](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/spatial-types.html) and [Spatial Relation\
Functions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.html) in the MySQL 5.7 documentation.

- Aurora MySQL version 3 supports the same spatial data types and spatial relation functions as MySQL 8.0. For more
information about these data types and functions, see [Spatial Data Types](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/spatial-types.html) and [Spatial Relation\
Functions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.html) in the MySQL 8.0 documentation.

- Aurora MySQL version 8.4 supports the same spatial data types and spatial relation functions as MySQL 8.4. For more
information about these data types and functions, see [Spatial Data Types](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/spatial-types.html) and [Spatial Relation\
Functions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.html) in the MySQL 8.4 documentation.

- Aurora MySQL supports spatial indexing on InnoDB tables. Spatial indexing improves query performance on large datasets for
queries on spatial data. In MySQL, spatial indexing for InnoDB tables is available in MySQL 5.7 and 8.0.

Aurora MySQL uses a different spatial indexing strategy from MySQL for high performance with spatial queries. The
Aurora spatial index implementation uses a space-filling curve on a B-tree, which is intended to provide higher
performance for spatial range scans than an R-tree.

###### Note

In Aurora MySQL, a transaction on a table with a spatial index defined on a column with a spatial reference
identifier (SRID) can't insert into an area selected for update by another transaction.

The following data definition language (DDL) statements are supported for creating
indexes on columns that use spatial data types.

### CREATE TABLE

You can use the `SPATIAL INDEX` keywords in a `CREATE TABLE` statement to add a spatial index to a
column in a new table. Following is an example.

```sql

CREATE TABLE test (shape POLYGON NOT NULL, SPATIAL INDEX(shape));
```

### ALTER TABLE

You can use the `SPATIAL INDEX` keywords in an `ALTER TABLE` statement to add a
spatial index to a column in an existing table. Following is an example.

```sql

ALTER TABLE test ADD SPATIAL INDEX(shape);
```

### CREATE INDEX

You can use the `SPATIAL` keyword in a `CREATE INDEX` statement to add a spatial index
to a column in an existing table. Following is an example.

```sql

CREATE SPATIAL INDEX shape_index ON test (shape);
```
