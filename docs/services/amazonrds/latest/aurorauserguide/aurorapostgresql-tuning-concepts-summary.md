# Aurora PostgreSQL wait events

The following table lists the wait events for Aurora PostgreSQL that most commonly
indicate performance problems, and summarizes the most common causes and corrective
actions. The following wait events are a subset of the list in [Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL wait events](aurorapostgresql-reference-waitevents.md).

Wait eventDefinition

[Client:ClientRead](apg-waits-clientread.md)

This event occurs when Aurora PostgreSQL is waiting to receive data
from the client.

[Client:ClientWrite](apg-waits-clientwrite.md)

This event occurs when Aurora PostgreSQL is waiting to write data to
the client.

[CPU](apg-waits-cpu.md)

This event occurs when a thread is active in CPU or is waiting for CPU.

[IO:BufFileRead and IO:BufFileWrite](apg-waits-iobuffile.md)

These events occur when Aurora PostgreSQL creates temporary
files.

[IO:DataFileRead](apg-waits-iodatafileread.md)

This event occurs when a connection waits on a backend process to
read a required page from storage because the page isn't available
in shared memory.

[IO:XactSync](apg-waits-xactsync.md)

This event occurs when the database is waiting for the Aurora
storage subsystem to acknowledge the commit of a regular
transaction, or the commit or rollback of a prepared transaction.

[IPC:DamRecordTxAck](apg-waits-ipcdamrecordtxac.md)

This event occurs when Aurora PostgreSQL in a session using database
activity streams generates an activity stream event, then waits for
that event to become durable.

[IPC:parallel wait events](apg-ipc-parallel.md)

These wait events indicate that a session is waiting for
inter-process communication related to parallel query execution
operations.

[IPC:ProcArrayGroupUpdate](apg-rpg-ipcprocarraygroup.md)

This event occurs when a session is waiting for the group leader
to update the transaction status at the end of the
transaction.

[Lock:advisory](apg-waits-lockadvisory.md)

This event occurs when a PostgreSQL application uses a lock to
coordinate activity across multiple sessions.

[Lock:extend](apg-waits-lockextend.md)

This event occurs when a backend process is waiting to lock a
relation to extend it while another process has a lock on that
relation for the same purpose.

[Lock:Relation](apg-waits-lockrelation.md)

This event occurs when a query is waiting to acquire a lock on a
table or view that's currently locked by another transaction.

[Lock:transactionid](apg-waits-locktransactionid.md)

This event occurs when a transaction is waiting for a row-level lock.

[Lock:tuple](apg-waits-locktuple.md)

This event occurs when a backend process is waiting to acquire a
lock on a tuple.

[LWLock:buffer\_content (BufferContent)](apg-waits-lockbuffercontent.md)

This event occurs when a session is waiting to read or write a
data page in memory while another session has that page locked for
writing.

[LWLock:buffer\_mapping](apg-waits-lwl-buffer-mapping.md)

This event occurs when a session is waiting to associate a data
block with a buffer in the shared buffer pool.

[LWLock:BufferIO (IPC:BufferIO)](apg-waits-lwlockbufferio.md)

This event occurs when Aurora PostgreSQL or RDS for PostgreSQL is waiting
for other processes to finish their input/output (I/O) operations
when concurrently trying to access a page.

[LWLock:lock\_manager](apg-waits-lw-lock-manager.md)

This event occurs when the Aurora PostgreSQL engine maintains the shared lock's
memory area to allocate, check, and deallocate a lock when a fast path lock isn't possible.

[LWLock:MultiXact](apg-waits-lwlockmultixact.md)

This type of event occurs when Aurora PostgreSQL is keeping a session
open to complete multiple transactions that involve the same row in a
table. The wait event denotes which aspect of multiple transaction
processing is generating the wait event, that is,
LWLock:MultiXactOffsetSLRU, LWLock:MultiXactOffsetBuffer,
LWLock:MultiXactMemberSLRU, or LWLock:MultiXactMemberBuffer.

[LWLock:pg\_stat\_statements](apg-rpg-lwlockpgstat.md)

This event occurs when the `pg_stat_statements`
extension takes an exclusive lock on the hash table that tracks SQL
statements.

[Timeout:PgSleep](apg-waits-timeoutpgsleep.md)

This event occurs when a server process has called the
`pg_sleep` function and is waiting for the sleep
timeout to expire.
