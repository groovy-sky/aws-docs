# Amazon Aurora MySQL lab mode

###### Important

Lab mode was introduced in Aurora MySQL version 2 to enable the [Fast DDL](auroramysql-managing-fastddl.md) optimization, which improved
the efficiency of certain DDL operations. In Aurora MySQL version 3, lab mode has been
removed, and Fast DDL has been replaced by the MySQL 8.0 feature called [Instant DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/innodb-online-ddl-operations.html).

Aurora lab mode is used to enable Aurora features that are available in the current
Aurora database version, but are not enabled by default. While Aurora lab mode features
are not recommended for use in production DB clusters, you can use Aurora lab mode to
enable these features for DB clusters in your development and test environments. For
more information about Aurora features available when Aurora lab mode is enabled, see
[Aurora lab mode features](#AuroraMySQL.Updates.LabModeFeatures).

The `aurora_lab_mode` parameter is an instance-level parameter that is in the
default parameter group. The parameter is set to `0`
(disabled) in the default parameter group. To enable Aurora lab mode, create a custom parameter
group, set the `aurora_lab_mode` parameter to `1` (enabled) in the custom
parameter group, and modify one or more DB instances in your Aurora cluster to use the custom parameter
group. Then connect to the appropriate instance endpoint to try the lab mode features. For information
on modifying a DB parameter group, see [Modifying parameters in a DB parameter group in Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups-modifying.md). For information on
parameter groups and Amazon Aurora, see [Aurora MySQL configuration parameters](auroramysql-reference-parametergroups.md).

## Aurora lab mode features

The following Aurora feature is currently available when Aurora lab mode is enabled. You must enable Aurora lab mode before any of these features can
be used.

**Fast DDL**

This feature allows you to run an `ALTER TABLE tbl_name ADD COLUMN col_name
                            column_definition` operation nearly instantaneously. The operation completes without requiring the
table to be copied and without materially impacting other DML statements. Because it doesn't consume temporary storage for a table copy,
it makes DDL statements practical even for large tables on small instance classes.

Fast DDL is currently only supported for adding a nullable column, without a default value, at the end of a table. For more
information about using this feature, see [Altering tables in Amazon Aurora using Fast DDL](auroramysql-managing-fastddl.md).
