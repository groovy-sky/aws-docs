# Automatically connecting a Lambda function and an Aurora DB cluster

You can use the Amazon RDS console to simplify setting up a connection between a Lambda function
and an Aurora
DB cluster. Often, your DB cluster is in a private subnet within a VPC. The Lambda function
can be used by applications to access your private DB cluster.

The following image shows a direct connection between your DB cluster and your Lambda function.

![Automatically connect an Aurora DB cluster with a Lambda function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/auto-connect-aurora-lambda.png)

You can set up the connection between your Lambda function and your DB cluster through RDS Proxy to improve your database performance
and resiliency. Often, Lambda functions make frequent, short database connections that benefit from connection
pooling that RDS Proxy offers. You can take advantage of any AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication that you already have
for Lambda functions, instead of managing database credentials in your Lambda application code. For more
information, see [Amazon RDS Proxyfor Aurora](rds-proxy.md).

When you use the console to connect with an existing proxy, Amazon RDS updates the proxy security group to allow
connections from your DB cluster and
Lambda function.

You can also create a new proxy from the same console page. When you create a proxy in the console, to access
the DB cluster, you must input your
database credentials or select an AWS Secrets Manager secret.

###### Tip

To quickly connect a Lambda function to an Aurora
DB cluster, you can also use the in-console guided wizard. To open the wizard, do the following:

1. Open the [Functions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home) of the Lambda console.

2. Select the function you want to connect a database to.

3. On the **Configuration** tab, select **RDS databases**.

4. Choose **Connect to RDS database**.

After you've connected your function to a database, you can create a proxy by choosing **Add proxy**.

## Overview of automatic connectivity with a Lambda function

The following are requirements for connecting a Lambda function with an Aurora DB cluster:

- The Lambda function must exist in the same VPC as the DB cluster.

- Currently, the DB cluster can't be an Aurora Serverless DB cluster or part of an Aurora global database.

- The user who
sets up connectivity must have permissions to perform the following
Amazon RDS, Amazon EC2, Lambda, Secrets Manager, and IAM operations:

- Amazon RDS

- `rds:CreateDBProxies`

- `rds:DescribeDBClusters`

- `rds:DescribeDBProxies`

- `rds:ModifyDBCluster`

- `rds:ModifyDBProxy`

- `rds:RegisterProxyTargets`

- Amazon EC2

- `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress`

- `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress`

- `ec2:CreateSecurityGroup`

- `ec2:DeleteSecurityGroup`

- `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups`

- `ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupEgress`

- `ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupIngress`

- Lambda

- `lambda:CreateFunctions`

- `lambda:ListFunctions`

- `lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration`

- Secrets Manager

- `secretsmanager:CreateSecret`

- `secretsmanager:DescribeSecret`

- IAM

- `iam:AttachPolicy`

- `iam:CreateRole`

- `iam:CreatePolicy`

- AWS KMS

- `kms:describeKey`

###### Note

If the DB cluster and Lambda
function are in different Availability Zones, your account might incur cross-Availability Zone costs.

When you set up a connection between a Lambda function and an Aurora DB cluster, Amazon RDS configures
the VPC security group for your function and for your DB cluster. If you use RDS Proxy,
then Amazon RDS also configures the VPC security group for the proxy. Amazon RDS acts according to the
current configuration of the security groups associated with the DB cluster, Lambda function, and proxy, as described
in the following table.

Current RDS security group configurationCurrent Lambda security group configurationCurrent proxy security group configurationRDS action

There are one or more security groups associated with the DB cluster with a
name that matches the pattern `rds-lambda-n` or
if a proxy is already connected to your DB cluster, RDS checks if the
`TargetHealth` of an associated proxy is `AVAILABLE`.

A security group that matches the pattern hasn't been modified. This security
group has only one inbound rule with the VPC security group of the Lambda function or
proxy as the source.

There are one or more security groups associated with the Lambda function with a
name that matches the pattern `lambda-rds-n` or
`lambda-rdsproxy-n` (where
`n` is a number).

A security group that matches the pattern hasn't been modified. This security
group has only one outbound rule with either the VPC security group of the DB cluster or the
proxy as the destination.

There are one or more security groups associated with the proxy with a name that
matches the pattern `rdsproxy-lambda-n` (where
`n` is a number).

A security group that matches the pattern hasn't been modified. This security
group has inbound and outbound rules with the VPC security groups of the Lambda
function and the DB cluster.

Amazon RDS takes no action.

A connection was already configured automatically between the Lambda function, the
proxy (optional), and DB cluster. Because a connection already exists between the
function, proxy, and the database, the security groups aren't modified.

Either of the following conditions apply:

- There is no security group associated with the DB cluster with a name that
matches the pattern `rds-lambda-n` or if the
`TargetHealth` of an associated proxy is
`AVAILABLE`.

- There are one or more security groups associated with the DB cluster
with a name that matches the pattern
`rds-lambda-n` or if the
`TargetHealth` of an associated proxy is `AVAILABLE`.
However, none of these security groups can be used for the connection with the
Lambda function.

Amazon RDS can't use a security group that doesn't have one inbound rule with the VPC
security group of the Lambda function or proxy as the source. Amazon RDS also can't use a
security group that has been modified. Examples of modifications include adding a rule
or changing the port of an existing rule.

Either of the following conditions apply:

- There is no security group associated with the Lambda function with a name that
matches the pattern `lambda-rds-n` or
`lambda-rdsproxy-n`.

- There are one or more security groups associated with the Lambda function with
a name that matches the pattern
`lambda-rds-n` or
`lambda-rdsproxy-n`. However, Amazon RDS
can't use any of these security groups for the connection with the DB cluster.

Amazon RDS can't use a security group that doesn't have one outbound rule with the VPC
security group of the DB cluster or proxy as the destination. Amazon RDS also can't use
a security group that has been modified.

Either of the following conditions apply:

- There is no security group associated with the proxy with a name that matches
the pattern `rdsproxy-lambda-n`.

- There are one or more security groups associated with the proxy with a name

###### RDS action: create new security groups

Amazon RDS takes the following actions:

- Creates a new security group that matches the pattern `rds-lambda-n`
or `rds-rdsproxy-n` (if you choose to use RDS Proxy). This security group
has an inbound rule with the VPC security group of the Lambda function or proxy as the source. This security
group is associated with the DB cluster and allows the function or proxy to access the DB cluster.

- Creates a new security group that matches the pattern `lambda-rds-n`
or `lambda-rdsproxy-n`. This security group has an outbound rule with
the VPC security group of the DB cluster or proxy as the destination. This security group is associated with the Lambda function and
allows the function to send traffic to the DB cluster or send traffic through a proxy.

- Creates a new security group that matches the pattern
`rdsproxy-lambda-n`. This security group has inbound and outbound
rules with the VPC security group of the DB cluster and the Lambda function.

###### RDS action: associate Lambda security group

Amazon RDS associates the valid, existing Lambda security group with the Lambda function. This security group allows the
function to send traffic to the DB cluster
or send traffic through a proxy.

## Automatically connecting a Lambda function and an Aurora DB cluster

You can use the Amazon RDS console to automatically connect a Lambda function to your DB cluster. This simplifies the process of setting up a connection
between these resources.

You can also use RDS Proxy to include a proxy in your connection. Lambda functions make frequent short database
connections that benefit from the connection pooling that RDS Proxy offers. You can also use any IAM authentication
that you've already set up for your Lambda function, instead of managing database credentials in your Lambda
application code.

You can connect an existing DB cluster to new and existing Lambda functions using the **Set up Lambda connection** page.
The setup process automatically sets up the required security groups for you.

Before setting up a connection between a Lambda function and a DB cluster, make sure that:

- Your Lambda function and DB cluster are in the same VPC.

- You have the right permissions for your user account. For more information about the requirements, see [Overview of automatic connectivity with a Lambda function](#lambda-rds-connect-overview).

If you change security groups after you configure connectivity, the changes might affect the connection between the Lambda function
and the DB cluster.

###### Note

You can automatically set up a connection between a DB cluster and a Lambda function only in the AWS Management Console. To connect a Lambda function,
all instances in the DB cluster
must be in the **Available** state.

###### To automatically connect a Lambda function and a DB cluster

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then choose the DB cluster that you want to connect to a Lambda function.

3. For **Actions**, choose **Set up Lambda connection**.

4. On the **Set up Lambda connection** page, under **Select Lambda function**,
    do either of the following:
   - If you have an existing Lambda function in the same VPC as your DB cluster, choose **Choose existing**
     **function**, and then choose the function.

   - If you don't have a Lambda function in the same VPC, choose **Create new function**, and
      then enter a **Function name**. The default runtime is set to Nodejs.18. You can modify the
      settings for your new Lambda function in the Lambda console after you complete the connection setup.
5. (Optional) Under **RDS Proxy**, select **Connect using RDS Proxy**, and
    then do any of the following:
   - If you have an existing proxy that you want to use, choose **Choose existing proxy**,
      and then choose the proxy.

   - If you don't have a proxy, and you want Amazon RDS to automatically create one for you, choose
      **Create new proxy**. Then, for **Database credentials**, do either of
      the following:

     1. Choose **Database username and password**, and then enter the
         **Username** and **Password** for your DB cluster.

     2. Choose **Secrets Manager secret**. Then, for **Select secret**,
         choose an AWS Secrets Manager secret. If you don't have a Secrets Manager secret, choose **Create new Secrets**
        **Manager secret** to [create a new secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create_secret.html). After you create
         the secret, for **Select secret**, choose the new secret.

After you create the new proxy, choose **Choose existing proxy**, and then choose the
proxy. Note that it might take some time for your proxy to be available for
connection.
6. (Optional) Expand **Connection**
**summary** and verify the highlighted updates for your resources.

7. Choose **Set**
**up**.

## Viewing connected compute resources

You can use the AWS Management Console to view the Lambda functions that are connected to your DB cluster. The
resources shown include compute resource connections that Amazon RDS set up automatically.

The listed compute resources don't include those that are manually connected to the DB cluster. For example, you can allow
a compute resource to access your DB cluster manually by adding a rule to your VPC security group associated with the database.

For the console to list a Lambda function, the following conditions must apply:

- The name of the security group associated with the compute resource matches the pattern
`lambda-rds-n` or
`lambda-rdsproxy-n` (where
`n` is a number).

- The security group associated with the compute resource has an outbound rule with the port range set
to the port of the DB cluster or an
associated proxy. The destination for the outbound rule must be set to a security group associated with the
DB cluster or an associated
proxy.

- If the configuration includes a proxy, the name of the security group attached to the proxy associated with your database matches the pattern
`rdsproxy-lambda-n` (where `n` is a number).

- The security group associated with the function has an outbound rule with the port
set to the port that the DB cluster or associated proxy uses. The destination must
be set to a security group associated with the DB cluster or associated
proxy.

###### To view compute resources automatically connected to an DB cluster

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then choose the DB cluster.

3. On the **Connectivity & security** tab, view the compute resources under
    **Connected compute resources**.
