# Best practices with Amazon Aurora

Following, you can find information on general best practices and options for using or
migrating data to an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.

Some of the best practices for Amazon Aurora are specific to a particular database engine. For
more information about Aurora best practices specific to a database engine, see the
following.

## Basic operational guidelines for Amazon Aurora

The following are basic operational guidelines that everyone should follow when
working with Amazon Aurora. The Amazon RDS Service Level Agreement requires that you follow these
guidelines:

- Monitor your memory, CPU, and storage usage. You can set up Amazon CloudWatch to notify
you when usage patterns change or when you approach the capacity of your
deployment. This way, you can maintain system performance and
availability.

- If your client application is caching the Domain Name Service (DNS) data of
your DB instances, set a time-to-live (TTL) value of less than 30 seconds. The
underlying IP address of a DB instance can change after a failover. Thus,
caching the DNS data for an extended time can lead to connection failures if
your application tries to connect to an IP address that no longer is in service.
Aurora DB clusters with multiple read replicas can experience connection failures
also when connections use the reader endpoint and one of the read replica
instances is in maintenance or is deleted.

- Test failover for your DB cluster to understand how long the process takes for
your use case. Testing failover can help you ensure that the application that
accesses your DB cluster can automatically connect to the new DB cluster after
failover.

## DB instance RAM recommendations

To optimize performance, allocate enough RAM so that your working set resides almost completely in memory.
To determine whether your working set is almost all in memory, examine the following metrics in Amazon CloudWatch:

- `VolumeReadIOPS` – This metric measures the average number
of read I/O operations from a cluster volume, reported at 5-minute intervals.
The value of `VolumeReadIOPS` should be small and stable. In some
cases, you might find your read I/O is spiking or is higher than usual. If so,
investigate the DB instances in your DB cluster to see which DB instances are
causing the increased I/O.

###### Tip

If your Aurora MySQL cluster uses parallel query, you might see an increase in `VolumeReadIOPS` values.
Parallel queries don't use the buffer pool. Thus, although the queries are fast, this optimized processing
can result in an increase in read operations and associated charges.

- `BufferCacheHitRatio` – This metric measures the percentage of requests that are served by the
buffer cache of a DB instance in your DB cluster. This metric gives you an insight into the amount of data that is being
served from memory.

A high hit ratio indicates that your DB instance has enough memory available. A low hit ratio indicates that your
queries on this DB instance are frequently going to disk. Investigate your workload to see which queries are causing
this behavior.

If, after investigating your workload, you find that you need more memory, consider scaling up the DB instance class to a
class with more RAM. After doing so, you can investigate the metrics discussed preceding and continue to scale up as necessary.
If your Aurora cluster is larger than 40 TB, don't use db.t2, db.t3, or db.t4g instance classes.

For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.AuroraMonitoring.Metrics.html).

## AWS database drivers

We recommend the AWS suite of drivers for application connectivity. The drivers have
been designed to provide support for faster switchover and failover times, and
authentication with AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Federated Identity. The AWS
drivers rely on monitoring DB cluster status and being aware of the cluster topology to
determine the new writer. This approach reduces switchover and failover times to
single-digit seconds, compared to tens of seconds for open-source drivers.

As new service features are introduced, the goal of the AWS suite of drivers is to
have built-in support for these service features.

For more information, see [Connecting to Aurora DB clusters with the AWS drivers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Connecting.html#Aurora.Connecting.Drivers).

## Monitoring Amazon Aurora

Amazon Aurora provides various metrics and insights that you can monitor to determine the
health and performance of your Aurora DB cluster. You can use various tools, such as the
AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and CloudWatch API, to view Aurora metrics. You can view the combined Performance Insights and CloudWatch
metrics in the Performance Insights dashboard and monitor your DB instance. To use this monitoring view,
Performance Insights must be turned on for your DB instance. For information about this monitoring view, see
[Viewing combined metrics with the Performance Insights dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Viewing_Unifiedmetrics.html).

You can create a performance analysis report for a specific time period and
view the insights identified and the recommendations to resolve the issues. For more information see, [Creating a performance analysis report in Performance Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.UsingDashboard.AnalyzePerformanceTimePeriod.html).

## Working with DB parameter groups and DB cluster parameter groups

We recommend that you try out DB parameter group and DB cluster parameter group changes on a test DB cluster before applying parameter group
changes to your production DB cluster. Improperly setting DB engine parameters can have unintended adverse effects, including degraded performance
and system instability.

Always use caution when modifying DB engine parameters, and back up your DB cluster
before modifying a DB parameter group. For information about backing up your DB cluster,
see [Backing up and restoring an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/BackupRestoreAurora.html).

and configuring an Amazon Aurora DB cluster to be more secure and highly available.
