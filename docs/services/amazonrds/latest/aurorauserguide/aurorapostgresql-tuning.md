# Tuning with wait events for Aurora PostgreSQL

Wait events are an important tuning tool for Aurora PostgreSQL. When you can find out why
sessions are waiting for resources and what they are doing, you're better able to
reduce bottlenecks. You can use the information in this section to find possible causes and
corrective actions. Before delving into this section, we strongly recommend that you
understand basic Aurora concepts, especially the following topics:

- [Amazon Aurora storage](aurora-overview-storagereliability.md)

- [Managing performance and scaling for Aurora DB clusters](aurora-managing-performance.md)

###### Important

The wait events in this section are specific to Aurora PostgreSQL. Use the information in
this section to tune Amazon Aurora only, not RDS for PostgreSQL.

Some wait events in this section have no analogs in the open source versions of these
database engines. Other wait events have the same names as events in open source
engines, but behave differently. For example, Amazon Aurora storage works differently from
open source storage, so storage-related wait events indicate different resource
conditions.
