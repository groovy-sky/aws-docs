# Processing Amazon RDS Data API query results in JSON format

When you call the `ExecuteStatement` operation, you can choose to have the query results returned as
a string in JSON format. That way, you can use your programming language's JSON parsing capabilities to
interpret and reformat the result set. Doing so can help to avoid writing extra code to loop through the result
set and interpret each column value.

To request the result set in JSON format, you pass the optional `formatRecordsAs` parameter with a
value of `JSON`. The JSON-formatted result set is returned in the `formattedRecords` field
of the `ExecuteStatementResponse` structure.

The `BatchExecuteStatement` action doesn't return a result set. Thus, the JSON option
doesn't apply to that action.

To customize the keys in the JSON hash structure, define column aliases in the result set. You can do so by
using the `AS` clause in the column list of your SQL query.

You might use the JSON capability to make the result set easier to read and map its contents to
language-specific frameworks. Because the volume of the ASCII-encoded result set is larger than the default
representation, you might choose the default representation for queries that return large numbers of rows or
large column values that consume more memory than is available to your application.

## Retrieving query results in JSON format

To receive the result set as a JSON string, include
`.withFormatRecordsAs(RecordsFormatType.JSON)` in the
`ExecuteStatement` call. The return value comes back as a JSON string in the
`formattedRecords` field. In this case, the `columnMetadata` is
`null`. The column labels are the keys of the object that represents each row.
These column names are repeated for each row in the result set. The column values are quoted
strings, numeric values, or special values representing `true`, `false`,
or `null`. Column metadata such as length constraints and the precise type for
numbers and strings isn't preserved in the JSON response.

If you omit the `.withFormatRecordsAs()` call or specify a parameter of `NONE`, the
result set is returned in binary format using the `Records` and `columnMetadata` fields.

## Data Type Mapping

The SQL values in the result set are mapped to a smaller set of JSON types. The values are represented in JSON
as strings, numbers, and some special constants such as `true`, `false`, and
`null`. You can convert these values into variables in your application, using strong or weak
typing as appropriate for your programming language.

## Troubleshooting

The JSON response is limited to 10 megabytes. If the response is larger than this limit, your program receives
a `BadRequestException` error. In this case, you can resolve the error using one of the following
techniques:

- Reduce the number of rows in the result set. To do so, add a `LIMIT` clause. You might split a
large result set into multiple smaller ones by submitting several queries with `LIMIT` and
`OFFSET` clauses.

If the result set includes rows that are filtered out by application logic, you can remove those rows from
the result set by adding more conditions in the `WHERE` clause.

- Reduce the number of columns in the result set. To do so, remove items from the select list of the query.

- Shorten the column labels by using column aliases in the query. Each column name is repeated in the JSON
string for each row in the result set. Thus, a query result with long column names and many rows could
exceed the size limit. In particular, use column aliases for complicated expressions to avoid having the
entire expression repeated in the JSON string.

- Although with SQL you can use column aliases to produce a result set having more than one column with the
same name, duplicate key names aren't allowed in JSON. The RDS Data API returns an error if you
request the result set in JSON format and more than one column has the same name. Thus, make sure that all
the column labels have unique names.

## Examples

The following Java examples show how to call `ExecuteStatement` with the response as a
JSON-formatted string, then interpret the result set. Substitute the appropriate values for the
`databaseName`, `secretStoreArn`, and
`clusterArn` parameters.

The following Java example demonstrates a query that returns a decimal numeric value in the result set. The
`assertThat` calls test that the fields of the response have the expected properties based on the
rules for JSON result sets.

This example works with the following schema and sample data:

```java

create table test_simplified_json (a float);
insert into test_simplified_json values(10.0);
```

```java

public void JSON_result_set_demo() {
    var sql = "select * from test_simplified_json";
    var request = new ExecuteStatementRequest()
      .withDatabase(databaseName)
      .withSecretArn(secretStoreArn)
      .withResourceArn(clusterArn)
      .withSql(sql)
      .withFormatRecordsAs(RecordsFormatType.JSON);
    var result = rdsdataClient.executeStatement(request);
}
```

The value of the `formattedRecords` field from the preceding program is:

```json

[{"a":10.0}]
```

The `Records` and `ColumnMetadata` fields in the response are both null, due to the
presence of the JSON result set.

The following Java example demonstrates a query that returns an integer numeric value in the result set. The
example calls `getFormattedRecords` to return only the JSON-formatted string and ignore the other
response fields that are blank or null. The example deserializes the result into a structure representing a
list of records. Each record has fields whose names correspond to the column aliases from the result set. This
technique simplifies the code that parses the result set. Your application doesn't have to loop through
the rows and columns of the result set and convert each value to the appropriate type.

This example works with the following schema and sample data:

```sql

create table test_simplified_json (a int);
insert into test_simplified_json values(17);
```

```java

public void JSON_deserialization_demo() {
    var sql = "select * from test_simplified_json";
    var request = new ExecuteStatementRequest()
      .withDatabase(databaseName)
      .withSecretArn(secretStoreArn)
      .withResourceArn(clusterArn)
      .withSql(sql)
      .withFormatRecordsAs(RecordsFormatType.JSON);
    var result = rdsdataClient.executeStatement(request)
      .getFormattedRecords();

/* Turn the result set into a Java object, a list of records.
   Each record has a field 'a' corresponding to the column
   labelled 'a' in the result set. */
    private static class Record { public int a; }
    var recordsList = new ObjectMapper().readValue(
        response, new TypeReference<List<Record>>() {
        });
}
```

The value of the `formattedRecords` field from the preceding program is:

```json

[{"a":17}]
```

To retrieve the `a` column of result row 0, the application would refer to
`recordsList.get(0).a`.

In contrast, the following Java example shows the kind of code that's required to construct a data
structure holding the result set when you don't use the JSON format. In this case, each row of the result
set contains fields with information about a single user. Building a data structure to represent the result
set requires looping through the rows. For each row, the code retrieves the value of each field, performs an
appropriate type conversion, and assigns the result to the corresponding field in the object representing the
row. Then the code adds the object representing each user to the data structure representing the entire result
set. If the query was changed to reorder, add, or remove fields in the result set, the application code would
have to change also.

```java

/* Verbose result-parsing code that doesn't use the JSON result set format */
for (var row: response.getRecords()) {
    var user = User.builder()
      .userId(row.get(0).getLongValue())
      .firstName(row.get(1).getStringValue())
      .lastName(row.get(2).getStringValue())
      .dob(Instant.parse(row.get(3).getStringValue()))
      .build();
    result.add(user);
  }
```

The following sample values show the values of the `formattedRecords` field for result sets with
different numbers of columns, column aliases, and column data types.

If the result set includes multiple rows, each row is represented as an object that is an array element. Each
column in the result set becomes a key in the object. The keys are repeated for each row in the result set.
Thus, for result sets consisting of many rows and columns, you might need to define short column aliases to
avoid exceeding the length limit for the entire response.

This example works with the following schema and sample data:

```sql

create table sample_names (id int, name varchar(128));
insert into sample_names values (0, "Jane"), (1, "Mohan"), (2, "Maria"), (3, "Bruce"), (4, "Jasmine");
```

```json

[{"id":0,"name":"Jane"},{"id":1,"name":"Mohan"},
{"id":2,"name":"Maria"},{"id":3,"name":"Bruce"},{"id":4,"name":"Jasmine"}]
```

If a column in the result set is defined as an expression, the text of the expression becomes the JSON key.
Thus, it's typically convenient to define a descriptive column alias for each expression in the select
list of the query. For example, the following query includes expressions such as function calls and arithmetic
operations in its select list.

```sql

select count(*), max(id), 4+7 from sample_names;
```

Those expressions are passed through to the JSON result set as keys.

```json

[{"count(*)":5,"max(id)":4,"4+7":11}]
```

Adding `AS` columns with descriptive labels makes the keys simpler to interpret in the JSON result
set.

```sql

select count(*) as rows, max(id) as largest_id, 4+7 as addition_result from sample_names;
```

With the revised SQL query, the column labels defined by the `AS` clauses are used as the key
names.

```json

[{"rows":5,"largest_id":4,"addition_result":11}]
```

The value for each key-value pair in the JSON string can be a quoted string. The string might contain unicode
characters. If the string contains escape sequences or the `"` or `\` characters, those
characters are preceded by backslash escape characters. The following examples of JSON strings demonstrate
these possibilities. For example, the `string_with_escape_sequences` result contains the special
characters backspace, newline, carriage return, tab, form feed, and `\`.

```json

[{"quoted_string":"hello"}]
[{"unicode_string":"邓不利多"}]
[{"string_with_escape_sequences":"\b \n \r \t \f \\ '"}]
```

The value for each key-value pair in the JSON string can also represent a number. The number might be an
integer, a floating-point value, a negative value, or a value represented as exponential notation. The
following examples of JSON strings demonstrate these possibilities.

```json

[{"integer_value":17}]
[{"float_value":10.0}]
[{"negative_value":-9223372036854775808,"positive_value":9223372036854775807}]
[{"very_small_floating_point_value":4.9E-324,"very_large_floating_point_value":1.7976931348623157E308}]
```

Boolean and null values are represented with the unquoted special keywords `true`,
`false`, and `null`. The following examples of JSON strings demonstrate these
possibilities.

```json

[{"boolean_value_1":true,"boolean_value_2":false}]
[{"unknown_value":null}]
```

If you select a value of a BLOB type, the result is represented in the JSON string as a base64-encoded value.
To convert the value back to its original representation, you can use the appropriate decoding function in
your application's language. For example, in Java you call the function
`Base64.getDecoder().decode()`. The following sample output shows the result of selecting a BLOB
value of `hello world` and returning the result set as a JSON string.

```java

[{"blob_column":"aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ="}]
```

The following Python example shows how to access the values from the result of a call to the Python
`execute_statement` function. The result set is a string value in the field
`response['formattedRecords']`. The code turns the JSON string into a data structure by calling the
`json.loads` function. Then each row of the result set is a list element within the data structure,
and within each row you can refer to each field of the result set by name.

```python

import json

result = json.loads(response['formattedRecords'])
print (result[0]["id"])
```

The following JavaScript example shows how to access the values from the result of a call
to the JavaScript `executeStatement` function. The result set is a string value in
the field `response.formattedRecords`. The code turns the JSON string into a data
structure by calling the `JSON.parse` function. Then each row of the result set is
an array element within the data structure, and within each row you can refer to each field of
the result set by name.

```javascript

<script>
    const result = JSON.parse(response.formattedRecords);
    document.getElementById("display").innerHTML = result[0].id;
</script>
```
