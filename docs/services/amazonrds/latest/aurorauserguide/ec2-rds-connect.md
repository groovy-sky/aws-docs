# Automatically connecting an EC2 instance and an Aurora DB cluster

You can use the Amazon RDS console to simplify setting up a connection between an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance and
an Aurora DB cluster. Often, your

DB cluster is in a private subnet and your EC2 instance is in a public subnet
within a VPC. You can use a SQL client on your EC2 instance to connect to your DB cluster. The EC2 instance can also run web servers or applications that access
your private DB cluster.

If you want to connect to an EC2 instance that isn't in the same VPC as the Aurora DB cluster, see the scenarios in [Scenarios for accessing a DB cluster in a VPC](user-vpc-scenarios.md).

## Overview of automatic connectivity with an EC2 instance

When you set up a connection between an EC2 instance and an Aurora DB
cluster, Amazon RDSautomatically configures the
VPC security group for your EC2 instance and for your DB cluster.

The following are requirements for connecting an EC2 instance with an Aurora DB cluster:

- The EC2 instance must exist in the same VPC as the DB cluster.

If no EC2 instances exist in the same VPC,
then the console provides
a link to create one.

- Currently, the DB cluster can't be an Aurora Serverless DB cluster or part of an Aurora global database.

- The user who sets up connectivity must have permissions to perform the following Amazon EC2 operations:

- `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress`

- `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress`

- `ec2:CreateSecurityGroup`

- `ec2:DescribeInstances`

- `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces`

- `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups`

- `ec2:ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute`

- `ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupEgress`

If the DB instance and EC2 instance are in different Availability Zones, your
account may incur cross-Availability Zone costs.

When you set up a connection to an EC2 instance, Amazon RDS acts
according to the current configuration of the security groups associated with the DB cluster and EC2 instance, as
described in the following table.

Current RDS security group configurationCurrent EC2 security group configurationRDS action

There are one or more security groups associated with the DB cluster with a name that matches the pattern
`rds-ec2-n` (where `n` is
a number). A security group that matches the pattern hasn't been modified. This security group has only
one inbound rule with the VPC security group of the EC2 instance as the source.

There are one or more security groups associated with the EC2 instance with a name
that matches the pattern `ec2-rds-n` (where
`n` is a number). A security group that
matches the pattern hasn't been modified. This security group has only one outbound
rule with the VPC security group of the DB cluster as the
source.

RDS takes no action.

A connection was already configured automatically between the EC2 instance and DB cluster. Because a
connection already exists between the EC2 instance and the RDS database, the security groups aren't
modified.

Either of the following conditions apply:

- There is no security group associated with the DB cluster with a name that matches the pattern
`rds-ec2-n`.

- There are one or more security groups associated with the DB cluster with a name that matches the pattern
`rds-ec2-n`. However,
Amazon RDS can't use any of these security groups for the connection with the EC2 instance.
Amazon RDS can't use a security group that doesn't have one inbound rule with the VPC security group of the EC2 instance as the source.
Amazon RDS also can't use a security group that
has been modified. Examples of modifications include adding a rule or changing the port of an existing
rule.

Either of the following conditions apply:

- There is no security group associated with the EC2 instance with a name that matches the pattern
`ec2-rds-n`.

- There are one or more security groups associated with the EC2 instance with a name that matches
the pattern `ec2-rds-n`. However,
Amazon RDS can't use any of these security groups for the
connection with the DB
cluster. Amazon RDS can't use a security group that
doesn't have one outbound rule with the VPC security group of the DB cluster as the source.
Amazon RDS also can't use a security group that has been modified.

[RDS action: create new security groups](#rds-action-create-new-security-groups)

There are one or more security groups associated with the DB cluster with a name that matches the pattern
`rds-ec2-n`. A security group that matches the pattern hasn't
been modified. This security group has only one inbound rule with the VPC security group of the EC2
instance as the source.

There are one or more security groups associated with the EC2 instance with a name that matches the

doesn't have one outbound rule with the VPC security group of the DB cluster as the source.
Amazon RDS also can't use a security group that has been modified.

[RDS action: create new security groups](#rds-action-create-new-security-groups)

There are one or more security groups associated with the DB cluster with a name that matches the pattern
`rds-ec2-n`. A security group that matches the pattern hasn't
been modified. This security group has only one inbound rule with the VPC security group of the EC2
instance as the source.

A valid EC2 security group for the connection exists, but it is not associated
with the EC2 instance. This security group has a name that matches the pattern
`ec2-rds-n`. It hasn't been modified. It has
only one outbound rule with the VPC security group of the DB
cluster as the source.

[RDS action: associate EC2 security group](#rds-action-associate-ec2-security-group)

Either of the following conditions apply:

- There is no security group associated with the DB cluster with a name that matches the pattern
`rds-ec2-n`.

- There are one or more security groups associated with the DB cluster with a name that matches the pattern
`rds-ec2-n`. However,
Amazon RDS can't use any of these security groups for the
connection with the EC2 instance.
Amazon RDS can't use a security group that

Amazon RDS also can't use security group that has been modified.

There are one or more security groups associated with the EC2 instance with a name
that matches the pattern `ec2-rds-n`. A security
group that matches the pattern hasn't been modified. This security group has only one
outbound rule with the VPC security group of the DB cluster as the
source.

[RDS action: create new security groups](#rds-action-create-new-security-groups)

###### RDS action: create new security groups

Amazon RDS takes the following actions:

- Creates a new security group that matches the pattern `rds-ec2-n`.
This security group has an inbound rule with the VPC security group of the EC2 instance as the source. This
security group is associated with the DB cluster and allows the EC2 instance to access the  DB cluster.

- Creates a new security group that matches the pattern
`ec2-rds-n`. This security group has an outbound
rule with the VPC security group of the DB cluster as the target. This
security group is associated with the EC2 instance and allows the EC2 instance to send
traffic to the DB cluster.

###### RDS action: associate EC2 security group

Amazon RDS
associates the valid, existing EC2 security group with the EC2 instance. This security group allows the EC2
instance to send traffic to the DB
cluster.

## Automatically connecting an EC2 instance and an Aurora DB cluster

Before setting up a connection between an EC2 instance and an Aurora DB cluster, make sure you meet the
requirements described in [Overview of automatic connectivity with an EC2 instance](#ec2-rds-connect-overview).

If you make changes to security groups after you configure connectivity, the changes might affect
the connection between the EC2 instance and the Aurora DB cluster.

###### Note

You can only set up a connection between an EC2 instance and an Aurora DB cluster automatically by using the
AWS Management Console. You can't set up a connection automatically with the AWS CLI or RDS API.

###### To connect an EC2 instance and an Aurora DB cluster automatically

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then choose the
    DB cluster.

3. From **Actions**, choose **Set up EC2**
**connection**.

The **Set up EC2 connection** page appears.

4. On the **Set up EC2 connection** page, choose the EC2 instance.

![Set up EC2 connection page.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/auto-connect-rds-ec2-set-up.png)

If no EC2 instances exist in the same VPC, choose **Create EC2 instance**
    to create one. In this case, make sure the new EC2 instance is in the same VPC as the
    DB cluster.

5. Choose **Continue**.

The **Review and confirm** page appears.

![EC2 connection review and confirmation page.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/auto-connect-rds-ec2-confirm.png)

6. On the **Review and confirm** page, review the changes that RDS will make to
    set up connectivity with the EC2 instance.

If the changes are correct, choose **Confirm and set up**.

If the changes aren't correct, choose **Previous** or **Cancel**.

## Viewing connected compute resources

You can use the AWS Management Console to view the compute resources that are connected to an
Aurora DB cluster. The resources shown include compute resource connections that were set
up automatically. You can set up connectivity with compute resources automatically in the
following ways:

- You can select the compute resource when you create the database.

For more information, see [Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-createinstance.md).

- You can set up connectivity between an existing database and a compute resource.

For more information, see [Automatically connecting an EC2 instance and an Aurora DB cluster](#ec2-rds-connect-connecting).

The listed compute resources don't include ones that were connected to the database manually. For example,
you can allow a compute resource to access a database manually by adding a rule to the VPC security group
associated with the database.

For a compute resource to be listed, the following conditions must apply:

- The name of the security group associated with the compute resource matches the pattern
`ec2-rds-n` (where
`n` is a number).

- The security group associated with the compute resource has an outbound rule
with the port range set to the port that the DB cluster uses.

- The security group associated with the compute resource has an outbound rule with the source
set to a security group associated with the
DB cluster.

- The name of the security group associated with the DB cluster matches the
pattern `rds-ec2-n` (where
`n` is a number).

- The security group associated with the DB cluster has an inbound
rule with the port range set to the port that the DB cluster uses.

- The security group associated with the
DB cluster
has an inbound rule with the source set to a security group associated with the compute resource.

###### To view compute resources connected to an Aurora DB cluster

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then choose the name of the
    DB cluster.

3. On the **Connectivity & security** tab, view the compute resources in the
    **Connected compute resources**.
