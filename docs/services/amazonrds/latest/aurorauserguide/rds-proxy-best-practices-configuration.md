# Configuration guidelines

This section describes the settings available in RDS Proxy and provides
best practices for aligning configuration across the application stack. These are combined
guidelines for using RDS Proxy with Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora. RDS-specific and Aurora-specific notes
are called out where applicable.

Unless noted otherwise, the terms "database" or "target" refer to an Aurora cluster, an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB
cluster, or an Amazon RDS instance.

## Settings for RDS Proxy

### MaxConnectionsPercent

Minimum valueMaximum valueDefault valuelesser of (1, MaxIdleConnectionsPercent)100100

For more information, see [MaxConnectionsPercent](rds-proxy-connections.md#rds-proxy-connection-pooling-tuning.maxconnectionspercent).

This setting limits the number of connections that RDS Proxy can establish with the
target database, as a percentage of the maximum number of connections allowed by the
database. The proxy opens back-end connections as needed, so the actual number of
connections at any given time might be lower than the configured maximum.

Given that the `MaxConnectionsPercent` setting is a percentage of the
database connection limit, the proxy's connection pool size
automatically follows database configuration. This means you don't need to reconfigure
your proxies whenever you resize your database instances or make configuration changes.
It also means you need to be aware of the scenarios when the database settings might
change, whether implicitly or explicitly:

- If you did not explicitly set the connection limit (such as the `max_connections` parameter) in your
database's parameter group, Amazon RDS and Aurora calculate it automatically based on the
database instance class. As a result, the implicit connection limit can change when you scale your database instances, thus
influencing the maximum pool size in the proxy. For more information, see
[Maximum number of database connections](../userguide/chap-limits.md#RDS_Limits.MaxConnections) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_,
[Maximum connections to an Aurora MySQL DB instance](auroramysql-managing-performance.md#AuroraMySQL.Managing.MaxConnections), and
[Maximum connections to an Aurora PostgreSQL DB instance](aurorapostgresql-managing.md#AuroraPostgreSQL.Managing.MaxConnections) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Aurora Serverless v2 database instances determine their connection limit based on
the database's maximum ACU configuration. For details, see
[Maximum connections for Aurora Serverless v2](aurora-serverless-v2-setting-capacity.md#aurora-serverless-v2.max-connections) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

Best practices:

- The default setting of 100 percent is suitable for databases that receive all
of their traffic through the proxy and don't need any headroom for administrative
access or other clients.

- Reduce this setting when the database also receives traffic directly from
applications (bypassing the proxy) and you don't want the proxy to consume all the
connections, or when you want to set a certain number of connections aside for other
purposes such as direct access by database administrators.

- When using RDS Proxy with Aurora Global Database clusters and Write Forwarding
is enabled, reduce your proxy's `MaxConnectionsPercent` value by the
quota that's allotted for write forwarding. For details, see configuration
parameters for write forwarding in
[Aurora MySQL](aurora-global-database-write-forwarding-ams.md#aurora-global-database-write-forwarding-params-ams) and
[Aurora PostgreSQL](aurora-global-database-write-forwarding-apg.md#aurora-global-database-write-forwarding-params-apg) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.
This recommendation applies whether the proxy is serving a cluster in the primary
or a secondary Region of the global database. Secondary clusters can be promoted to
the primary role, so it's a good practice to keep proxy settings consistent across
the entire global topology. You _can_ use asymmetric settings for
proxies serving primary versus secondary regions, but you'll need to adjust those
settings after each global failover or switchover.

- If the target serves multiple proxies, the combined value of
`MaxConnectionsPercent` across all those proxies must not exceed 100 so
that the database doesn't become oversubscribed. We recommend using a single proxy
per target to simplify configuration and management. In particular, you
don't need to use multiple proxies per database for redundancy. For more information, see [Using multiple proxies with one target](rds-proxy-best-practices-usage-scenarios.md#rds-proxy-best-practices.multiple-proxies).

Whether you're using the default `MaxConnectionsPercent` setting or a
custom value, keep at least a 30% headroom between the number of connections allowed and
the maximum number of client connections expected during peak periods. For example:

- If you believe the proxy will need up to 50% of the connection limit
configured for the database, use a `MaxConnectionsPercent` setting of at
least `1.3 * 50% = 65%`.

- When using the default `MaxConnectionsPercent` setting of 100, make
sure the database limit itself provides enough headroom.

This additional headroom improves client experience during unexpected workload spikes
and helps RDS Proxy redistribute connections across its internal infrastructure for heat
management and other purposes.

Although you can set `MaxConnectionsPercent` to a value as
low as 1, we recommend the following minimums based on instance type:

- db.t3.small: 100

- db.t3.medium: 55

- db.t3.large: 35

- db.r3.large or above: 20

### MaxIdleConnectionsPercent

Minimum valueMaximum valueDefault value (SQL Server)Default value (other engines)(zero)MaxConnectionsPercent5% of MaxConnectionsPercent50% of MaxConnectionsPercent

For more information, see [MaxIdleConnectionsPercent](rds-proxy-connections.md#rds-proxy-connection-pooling-tuning.maxidleconnectionspercent).

This setting limits the number of idle database connections that RDS Proxy keeps in
the connection pool, as a percentage of the maximum number of connections allowed by the
database. A database (back-end) connection is considered to be idle when there's been no
activity on the connection for five minutes. This setting applies to connections between
the proxy and the back-end database.

Note the following:

- This setting limits the number of idle connections in the pool, but doesn't force
the proxy to retain a given number of idle connections. If the client activity is very
low, the actual number of back-end database connections can be lower than
`MaxIdleConnectionsPercent`.

- Connections count as idle when they are available for reuse in the proxy's
connection pool. Pinned connections are not available for reuse by other clients, and
therefore don't count as idle for the purposes of enforcing
`MaxIdleConnectionsPercent`. For more information about pinning, see
[Avoiding pinning an RDS Proxy](rds-proxy-pinning.md).

- The number of idle connections reported by database metadata is typically higher
than the number of idle connections recorded by RDS Proxy metrics. This can be due to
direct client connections bypassing the proxy as well as internal connections used by
Amazon RDS and Aurora automation.

###### Note

The connection idle time observed and enforced at the proxy layer might be
different than the idle time reported by database tools such as the MySQL process list
or the activity statistics tables in PostgreSQL. RDS Proxy pings back-end
connections occasionally, which resets the database idle timers even though the
connection remains idle in terms of client activity.

Best practices:

The default setting of 50 is suitable and recommended for most workloads. Changing
the setting has the following effect:

- When you raise `MaxIdleConnectionsPercent`, the database observes a
larger number of idle connections which can increase database resource consumption
outside of peak hours. On the other hand, connection spikes handled through the
proxy experience lower borrow latency because there are more connections readily
available in the pool.

- When you lower `MaxIdleConnectionsPercent`, the proxy closes idle
connections more aggressively, potentially reducing the contention and resource
consumption caused by those connections. However, connection spikes passing through
the proxy might experience longer borrow times. As there are fewer connections
available in the pool, the proxy needs to spend additional time opening new back-end
connections during a spike.

Resource consumption by idle connections might not be a material concern in databases
using provisioned instance types, but Aurora databases using the Serverless v2 instance
type might prefer to optimize idle resource consumption to reduce cost.

### IdleClientTimeout

Minimum valueMaximum valueDefault value1 minute8 hours30 minutes

For more information, see [IdleClientTimeout](rds-proxy-connections.md#rds-proxy-connection-pooling-tuning.idleclienttimeout).

This setting determines how long a client connection can remain idle before the proxy
closes it. Note that RDS Proxy enforces a maximum connection lifetime of 24 hours,
regardless of whether the connection is idle. For example, if you configure
`IdleClientTimeout` to 30 minutes (default) and ping the database every
minute, the connection never exceeds the idle timeout, but it doesn't remain open
indefinitely. RDS Proxy closes the connection after 24 hours even if it doesn't qualify
as idle.

The `IdleClientTimeout` setting applies to the connection between a client
(applications or interactive users) and RDS Proxy. To understand idle behavior of
back-end connections between RDS Proxy and the database, see
[MaxIdleConnectionsPercent](#rds-proxy-best-practices.configuration.maxidleconnectionspercent).

Best practices:

- The idle timeout must be long enough to accommodate normal pauses in SQL
activity inside of a client connection or transaction. It must not be so long as to
allow a client to hold on to resources that it reasonably no longer needs, but that
might be needed by other clients. This is particularly important if you observe
connection pinning because a connection pinned by one client can't be reused by
other clients.

- For RDS Proxy to correctly enforce the timeout, the client connection
must be truly idle without sending any queries (even simple health checks such as
`SELECT 1;`) or protocol pings (such as `COM_PING` in
MySQL). If you observe connections not being closed despite exceeding the timeout,
check the connection logic of your application drivers. Application-level connection
pools are particularly likely to perform their own liveness checks interfering
with `IdleClientTimeout`.

### ConnectionBorrowTimeout

Minimum valueMaximum valueDefault value(zero)5 minutes2 minutes

For more information, see [ConnectionBorrowTimeout](rds-proxy-connections.md#rds-proxy-connection-pooling-tuning.connectionborrowtimeout).

When a client connects to RDS Proxy, the proxy must either borrow an existing available
connection from the pool or open a new database connection. This setting defines how long
RDS Proxy waits for a connection to be borrowed or opened before returning an error.

Note the following:

- A `ConnectionBorrowTimeout` of zero results in timeout errors when the
connection pool doesn't already contain an available connection.
This is true even if the pool is below maximum capacity and could open a new back-end connection.

- Even with `MaxIdleConnectionsPercent` equal to
`MaxConnectionsPercent`, the actual number of connections in the pool can
be lower than the configured maximum. In other words,
`MaxIdleConnectionsPercent` limits the amount of idle connections but
doesn't force connections to remain open.

It is normal for a connection pool to run below maximum capacity. In this
situation, using a `ConnectionBorrowTimeout` setting of zero can prevent the
pool from growing because the pool isn't allowed to wait for a new connection to be
opened. As a result, you should use non-zero `ConnectionBorrowTimeout`
values for all workloads unless the previously described behavior is preferred.

###### Note

This setting also applies when the database is not ready to accept
connections, such as during offline maintenance operations and failovers. The logic for
enforcing the `ConnectionBorrowTimeout` is the same whether the database is
up or down.

### Initialization queries and pinning filters

RDS Proxy supports additional features that can reduce connection pinning and improve
multiplexing efficiency as a result.

An **initialization query** is one or more statements run
each time the proxy sets up a new back-end database connection. If your clients use
identical statements to set up session parameters, you can move those statements to the
proxy's initialization query. This helps reduce the probability of pinning and it also
improves efficiency: a particular back-end database connection runs its initialization
query once during setup but it might be reused later by many clients. Keep in mind that
putting SQL statements in the initialization query does not filter them out from
client traffic. You still need to remove those statements from the application code so
that they don't interfere with multiplexing.

**Session pinning filters** are a configuration property
that prevents the proxy from pinning certain session states. The only filter option
currently available, `EXCLUDE_VARIABLE_SETS`, instructs the proxy to ignore
all `SET` statements when determining whether a session should be pinned. The
`SET` statements are still passed on to the database and can affect session
state, which means this option is only safe in the following situations:

1. The `SET` statements are no-ops, such as setting a system variable to
    a value identical with the server default.

2. The `SET` statements and subsequent queries are part of the same
    transaction, and every transaction sets up its own state fully independently so that
    it's not affected by variables set by other transactions.

###### Note

The `EXCLUDE_VARIABLE_SETS` pinning filter is an all-or-nothing
setting and you cannot selectively choose which `SET` statements to ignore. Do
not use this filter as a blanket solution for pinning unless your use case falls under one
of the categories discussed in the preceding list.

For best results, remove unnecessary statements from application code where
possible, and only using filters if application modifications are not possible. This
promotes a less noisy and more predictable client-server environment as opposed to
applying special treatment to statements that aren't needed in the first place.

###### Important

Neither initialization queries nor pinning filters cause RDS Proxy to
alter the client-server query traffic. Statements arriving from the clients are still
passed on to the database regardless of the init query or pinning filter
configuration.

For more information, see:

- [Creating a proxy](../userguide/rds-proxy-creating.md) and
[Modifying a proxy](../userguide/rds-proxy-modifying-proxy.md) for Amazon RDS.

- [Creating a proxy](rds-proxy-creating.md) and
[Modifying a proxy](rds-proxy-modifying-proxy.md) for Amazon Aurora.

For PostgreSQL connections, you can also put supported connection parameters in
the startup message exchanged between the client driver and the proxy. This avoids sending
separate `SET` commands, both reducing round-trips and avoiding connection
pinning caused by explicit `SET` statements. For more information, see [Considerations for connecting to PostgreSQL](rds-proxy-connecting.md#rds-proxy-connecting-postgresql).

## Aligning application, proxy, and database configuration

As discussed in the preceding section, RDS Proxy supports a range of parameters to help
you align the proxy behavior with your application needs. However, choosing the right
configuration values is a task that cuts across all layers of the stack: the application,
the proxy, and the database itself. The settings of all those components must be aligned
with the following goals in mind:

1. Provide the expected level of performance and scalability during normal
    operations.

2. Promote clarity and ease of troubleshooting during workload issues.

3. Help the stack deal with unexpected events (such as workload surges) with
    minimal impact to the application.

When choosing and tuning settings in a multi-layered environment, try to align
configuration values such that the limits and timeouts at a lower layer are equal to or
higher than the corresponding limits and timeouts at a higher layer. In other words, treat
settings from one layer as an envelope that fits into the next configuration envelope
further down the stack.

For example, assume that your application is the top layer, the proxy is a middle layer,
and the database is the lower layer. If the timeouts and limits at the proxy level are lower
than the limits at the application level, proxy limits preempt application limits. The
application is unable to exercise its settings and it experiences behaviors that can't be
explained by its own configuration.

Consider the `IdleClientTimeout` proxy setting as an example. If your
application drivers or client pools enforce their own idle timeouts, the proxy's idle
timeout is a safety net on top of the application settings. This means the
`IdleClientTimeout` must be at least equal to any application-level idle
timeouts to prevent confusion:

- When the application idle timeout is lower than the proxy timeout, you expect the
application to close its connections as configured. If the application fails to close
idle connections in a timely manner, the proxy acts as a backstop.

- When the application idle timeout is longer than the proxy timeout, the application
might experience connection closures that are considered premature. This can lead to
confusion on the application side.

The same logic applies to other settings such as connection limits: each layer's
settings should fit inside of the envelope defined by the next layer's configuration.

For best results, configuration settings should include some padding between one layer and the
next. For example, you can make the proxy timeout a few seconds longer than the application
timeout to avoid sporadic errors due to client/server clock drift, or in case the client
needs additional time to gracefully close the connection.

In other words, align your settings like this:

`client timeout < proxy timeout < database timeout`

Instead of doing this:

`client timeout = proxy timeout = database timeout`

And avoid this:

`client timeout > proxy timeout > database timeout`

## Database configuration

### Connection limits

RDS Proxy uses the `MaxConnectionsPercent` setting to determine the
maximum size of its connection pool, which means the proxy's connection pool size is
relative to the database's connection limit. When you change
the database's connection limit, the proxy's pool size follows automatically. If you
want the database to reserve a portion of connection limit for non-proxy
users, you should do that by lowering the `MaxConnectionsPercent` setting in the
proxy rather than by increasing the database limit.

RDS Proxy doesn't eliminate the need for proper configuration of database
connection limits. A single proxy connection isn't inherently lighter than a single direct
client connection, so don't increase database limits solely because you're using a proxy.
A proxy doesn't reduce the amount of work the database must perform to handle queries,
but it helps the database handle the same workload using fewer connections.

### Idle timeouts

Databases can enforce their own idle timeouts, for example, using the
`wait_timeout` and `interactive_timeout` settings in MySQL or the
`transaction_timeout` and
`idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` settings in PostgreSQL. Default values
for those settings are unlikely to interfere with proxy configuration, but if you use
custom database-level timeouts, make sure they're at least as long as the corresponding
proxy timeouts or otherwise the proxy experiences connection errors due to premature
timeouts.

The same logic applies to database environments using connection killers, which are scripts or
processes that monitor session state and actively terminate connections based on certain
criteria. If your environment uses such techniques, ensure that the connection termination
logic aligns with proxy settings.

Databases that handle all their workload through the proxy can typically depend on the
proxy configuration for idle timeouts, and leave the database-level settings at their
default values.

## Application configuration

### Managing session state

Many database drivers, application frameworks, and object-relational mapping (ORM)
tools use session variables or `SET` statements to set up connections
before sending query traffic. The use of connection and transaction
initialization statements might not be obvious when looking at the application code alone,
and there can be several layers of abstraction between the database itself and the SQL
statements and application logic. You can use the RDS Proxy enhanced logging feature to
record reasons for connection pinning, and database query logs can provide further
information about all statements sent over your database connections.

Consider the following best practices:

1. Set connection parameters only when they're different from database defaults and
    the client session must deviate from those defaults. Removing unnecessary
    initialization statements not only helps with multiplexing, but it also reduces the
    number of client-server round trips for each new database connection.

2. Set variables and configuration settings consistently across all
    connections.

3. Avoid session configuration that can also be applied at query runtime.
    For example, if different clients need to see data in different time zones,
    consider using time zone conversion functions at the query level instead of setting the
    time zone at the session level.

4. If possible, move session configuration statements to the proxy layer using the
    initialization query feature. For more details, see
    [Initialization queries and pinning filters](#rds-proxy-best-practices.configuration.pinning-filters).

### Liveness checks

If your application uses connection pooling or advanced drivers, look for
configuration related to liveness checks such as protocol pings, health check
statements, or keep-alive queries. RDS Proxy treats all client requests equally, so even
though a `SELECT 1;` query or a `COM_PING` request is a no-op from
the application perspective, it prevents the proxy from enforcing idle client timeouts and
managing the connection pool size according to
`MaxIdleConnectionsPercent`.

###### Note

RDS Proxy enforces a maximum connection lifetime of 24 hours regardless of
the activity on the connection.

In most cases, it might be appropriate to disable client-side liveness checks to
reduce protocol noise and help RDS Proxy manage idle connections. There are edge cases
when you might want to run those health checks regardless:

- You deliberately want to prevent certain connections from timing out in the proxy
layer.

- You want to allow the application driver or pool to proactively detect when a
connection is dropped by the proxy. For example, pinned back-end connections might be
closed due to a database restart and client connections might exceed the 24 hour
maximum lifetime.

Consider disabling liveness checks on the application side, or only perform them for
the specific connections that you want to keep from timing out.

### Session state tracking

Some MySQL database drivers, such as the MariaDB driver, use
`session_track_*` variables to enable tracking of session state. With this
feature enabled, whenever the client makes a session state change that the server can
track, the server includes the state change information in its response packets. This
allows the driver to be advised about session state by the server.

This manner of session state tracking can be meaningful when the client interacts with
the server directly and implements its own session management features, such as session
migration in multi-server environments. RDS Proxy implements its own state tracking
mechanisms and doesn't use the information enabled by `session_track_*`
variables, however setting those variables causes session pinning.

If your database driver sets those variables, you can look for ways to disable the
tracking functionality in the driver, switch to a different driver, or use session pinning
filters to ignore the statements if it's safe to do so. For more details, see
[Initialization queries and pinning filters](#rds-proxy-best-practices.configuration.pinning-filters).
