# Avoiding pinning an RDS Proxy

Multiplexing is more efficient when database requests don't rely on state information from previous
requests. In that case, RDS Proxy can reuse a connection at the conclusion of each transaction. Examples of
such state information include most variables and configuration parameters that you can change through
`SET` or `SELECT` statements. SQL transactions on a client connection can multiplex
between underlying database connections by default.

Your connections to the proxy can enter a state known as _pinning_. When a connection is
pinned, each later transaction uses the same underlying database connection until the session ends. Other
client connections also can't reuse that database connection until the session ends. The session ends
when the client connection is dropped.

RDS Proxy automatically pins a client connection to a specific DB connection when it detects a session state
change that isn't appropriate for other sessions. Pinning reduces the effectiveness of connection
reuse. If all or almost all of your connections experience pinning, consider modifying your application code
or workload to reduce the conditions that cause the pinning.

For example, your application changes a session variable or configuration
parameter. In this case, later statements can rely on the new variable or parameter to be in
effect. Thus, when RDS Proxy processes requests to change session variables or configuration
settings, it pins that session to the DB connection. That way, the session state remains in
effect for all later transactions in the same session.

For some database engines, this rule doesn't apply to all parameters that you can set. RDS Proxy tracks certain statements and variables.
Thus, RDS Proxy doesn't pin the session when you modify them. In this case, RDS Proxy only reuses the connection for other sessions that have the
same values for those settings.
For the lists of tracked statements and variables for Aurora MySQL, see
[What RDS Proxy tracks for Aurora MySQL databases](#rds-proxy-pinning.mysql-tracked-vars).

## What RDS Proxy tracks for Aurora MySQL databases

RDS Proxy tracks the following MySQL statements:

- DROP DATABASE

- DROP SCHEMA

- USE

RDS Proxy tracks the following MySQL variables:

- `AUTOCOMMIT`

- `AUTO_INCREMENT_INCREMENT`

- `CHARACTER SET (or CHAR SET)`

- `CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT`

- `CHARACTER_SET_DATABASE`

- `CHARACTER_SET_FILESYSTEM`

- `CHARACTER_SET_CONNECTION`

- `CHARACTER_SET_RESULTS`

- `CHARACTER_SET_SERVER`

- `COLLATION_CONNECTION`

- `COLLATION_DATABASE`

- `COLLATION_SERVER`

- `INTERACTIVE_TIMEOUT`

- `NAMES`

- `NET_WRITE_TIMEOUT`

- `QUERY_CACHE_TYPE`

- `SESSION_TRACK_SCHEMA`

- `SQL_MODE`

- `TIME_ZONE`

- `TRANSACTION_ISOLATION (or TX_ISOLATION)`

- `TRANSACTION_READ_ONLY (or TX_READ_ONLY)`

- `WAIT_TIMEOUT`

###### Note

RDS Proxy tracks changes to the `TRANSACTION_ISOLATION` and
`TRANSACTION_READ_ONLY` variables when you set them at the session scope.
However, if you set them at the next transaction scope, RDS Proxy pins connections. This
behavior applies whether you use a `SET` statement or a `SET
              TRANSACTION` statement to configure these values.

## Minimizing pinning

Performance tuning for RDS Proxy involves trying to maximize transaction-level
connection reuse (multiplexing) by minimizing pinning.

You can minimize pinning by doing the following:

- Avoid unnecessary database requests that might cause pinning.

- Set variables and configuration settings consistently across all connections. That way, later sessions
are more likely to reuse connections that have those particular settings.

However, for PostgreSQL setting a variable leads to session pinning.

- For a MySQL engine family database, apply a session pinning filter to the proxy. You can exempt certain kinds of operations from pinning the
session if you know that doing so doesn't affect the correct operation of your application.

- See how frequently pinning occurs by monitoring the Amazon CloudWatch metric
`DatabaseConnectionsCurrentlySessionPinned`. For information about this and other CloudWatch
metrics, see [Monitoring RDS Proxy metrics with Amazon CloudWatch](rds-proxy-monitoring.md).

- If you use `SET` statements to perform identical initialization for each client connection,
you can do so while preserving transaction-level multiplexing. In this case, you move the statements
that set up the initial session state into the initialization query used by a proxy. This property is a
string containing one or more SQL statements, separated by semicolons.

For example, you can define an initialization query for a proxy that sets certain configuration
parameters. Then, RDS Proxy applies those settings whenever it sets up a new connection for that proxy.
You can remove the corresponding `SET` statements from your application code, so that they
don't interfere with transaction-level multiplexing.

For metrics about how often pinning occurs for a proxy, see
[Monitoring RDS Proxy metrics with Amazon CloudWatch](rds-proxy-monitoring.md).

## Conditions that cause pinning for all engine families

The proxy pins the session to the current connection in the following situations where multiplexing might
cause unexpected behavior:

- Any statement with a text size greater than 16 KB causes the proxy to pin the session.

## Conditions that cause pinning for Aurora MySQL

For MySQL, the following interactions also cause pinning:

- Explicit table lock statements `LOCK TABLE`, `LOCK
                  TABLES`, or `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK` cause the proxy to pin
the session.

- Creating named locks by using `GET_LOCK` causes the proxy to pin the
session.

- Setting a user or system variable (with some exceptions) pins the session to the
proxy. If this significantly limits connection reuse, you can configure
`SET` operations to avoid pinning. To do this, adjust the session pinning
filters property. For more information, see [Creating a proxy for Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/rds-proxy-creating.html) and [Modifying an RDS Proxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/rds-proxy-modifying-proxy.html).

- Creating a temporary table causes the proxy to pin the session. That way, the
contents of the temporary table are preserved throughout the session regardless of
transaction boundaries.

- Calling the `ROW_COUNT` and `FOUND_ROWS` functions sometimes causes pinning.

The exact circumstances where these functions cause pinning might differ among Aurora MySQL versions that
are compatible with MySQL 5.7.

- Prepared statements cause the proxy to pin the session. This rule applies whether
the prepared statement uses SQL text or the binary protocol.

- RDS Proxy does not pin connections when you use SET LOCAL.

- Calling stored procedures and stored functions doesn't cause pinning. RDS Proxy
doesn't detect any session state changes resulting from such calls. Make sure
that your application doesn't change session state inside stored routines if you
rely on that session state to persist across transactions. For example, RDS Proxy isn't
currently compatible with a stored procedure that creates a temporary table that
persists across all transactions.

- Queries with executable comments for MySQL (syntax /\*! ... \*/) or MariaDB (syntax /\*M! ... \*/)
cause pinning. RDS Proxy cannot parse SQL embedded in these comments to track session state changes.

If you have expert knowledge about your application behavior, you can skip the pinning behavior for certain
application statements. To do so, choose the **Session pinning filters** option when
creating the proxy. Currently, you can opt out of session pinning for setting session variables and
configuration settings.

## Conditions that cause pinning for Aurora PostgreSQL

For PostgreSQL, the following interactions also cause pinning:

- Using `SET` commands.

- Using `PREPARE`, `DISCARD`, `DEALLOCATE`, or
`EXECUTE` commands to manage prepared statements.

- Creating temporary sequences, tables, or views.

- Declaring cursors.

- Discarding the session state.

- Listening on a notification channel.

- Loading a library module such as `auto_explain`.

- Manipulating sequences using functions such as `nextval` and
`setval`.

- Interacting with locks using functions such as `pg_advisory_lock` and
`pg_try_advisory_lock`.

###### Note

RDS Proxy does not pin on transaction level advisory locks, specifically
`pg_advisory_xact_lock`, `pg_advisory_xact_lock_shared`,
`pg_try_advisory_xact_lock`, and
`pg_try_advisory_xact_lock_shared`.

- Setting a parameter, or resetting a parameter to its default. Specifically, using
`SET` and `set_config` commands to assign default values to
session variables.

- Calling stored procedures and stored functions doesn't cause pinning. RDS Proxy
doesn't detect any session state changes resulting from such calls. Make sure
that your application doesn't change session state inside stored routines if you
rely on that session state to persist across transactions. For example, RDS Proxy isn't
currently compatible with a stored procedure that creates a temporary table that
persists across all transactions.

- Discarding session state. If you use connection pooling libraries with `DISCARD ALL`
query configured as a reset query, RDS Proxy pins your client connection on release. This reduces the proxy's
multiplexing efficiency and might lead to unexpected results because the `DISCARD ALL`
command can interfere with session state management.
