# Using Amazon Aurora machine learning

By using Amazon Aurora machine learning, you can integrate your Aurora DB cluster with one of the following AWS machine learning services,
depending on your needs. They each support specific machine learning use cases.

**Amazon Bedrock**

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes leading foundation models from AI companies available through an API, along
with developer tooling to help build and scale generative AI applications. With Amazon Bedrock, you pay to run inference on
any of the third-party foundation models. Pricing is based on the volume of input tokens and output tokens, and on
whether you have purchased provisioned throughput for the model. For more information, see [What is Amazon Bedrock?](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.md) in the
_Amazon Bedrock User Guide_.

**Amazon Comprehend**

Amazon Comprehend is a managed natural language processing (NLP) service that's used to
extract insights from documents. With Amazon Comprehend, you can deduce sentiment based on the content of documents, by
analyzing entities, key phrases, language, and other features. To learn more,
see [What is Amazon Comprehend?](../../../comprehend/latest/dg/what-is.md) in the
_Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide_.

**SageMaker AI**

Amazon SageMaker AI is a fully managed machine
learning service. Data scientists and developers use Amazon SageMaker AI to build, train, and test machine
learning models for a variety of inference tasks, such as fraud detection and product recommendation.
When a machine learning model is ready for use in production, it can be deployed to the Amazon SageMaker AI hosted environment.
For more information, see [What Is Amazon SageMaker AI?](../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.md) in the _Amazon SageMaker AI Developer Guide_.

Using Amazon Comprehend with your Aurora DB cluster has less preliminary setup than using SageMaker AI. If you're new to AWS machine
learning, we recommend that you start by exploring Amazon Comprehend.
