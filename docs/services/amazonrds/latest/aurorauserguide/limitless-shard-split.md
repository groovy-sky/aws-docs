# Splitting a shard in a DB shard group

You can split a shard in a DB shard group manually into two smaller shards. This is called a _user-initiated_ shard
split.

Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database can also split shards when they have very large amounts of data or very high usage. This is called a
_system-initiated_ shard split.

- [Finalizing shard splits](#limitless-shard-split.finalize)

- [Canceling a shard split](#limitless-shard-split.cancel)

## Prerequisites

User-initiated shard splits have the following prerequisites:

- You must have a DB shard group.

- The DB shard group can't be empty: it must contain at least one sharded table.

- A user must have the `rds_aurora_limitless_cluster_admin` privilege. The `rds_superuser` has this privilege;
therefore the master user also has it. The `rds_superuser` can grant the privilege to other users:

```nohighlight

/* Logged in as the master user or a user with rds_superuser privileges */
CREATE USER username;
GRANT rds_aurora_limitless_cluster_admin to username;
```

- You must know the subcluster (node) ID of the shard that you want to split. You can obtain the ID by using the following query:

```nohighlight

SELECT * FROM rds_aurora.limitless_subclusters;

subcluster_id | subcluster_type
  ---------------+-----------------
1             | router
2             | router
3             | shard
4             | shard
5             | shard
6             | shard
```

To enable system-initiated shard splits, set the following DB cluster parameters in a custom DB cluster parameter group associated with your
DB cluster:

ParameterValue

`rds_aurora.limitless_enable_auto_scale`

`on`

`rds_aurora.limitless_auto_scale_options`

Either `split_shard` or `add_router,split_shard`

`rds_aurora.limitless_finalize_split_shard_mode`

This parameter determines how _system-initiated_ shard splits are finalized. The value can be one of
the following:

- `user_initiated` – You decide when to finalize the shard split. This is the default
value.

- `immediate` – Shard splits are finalized immediately.

For more information, see [Finalizing shard splits](#limitless-shard-split.finalize).

###### Note

This parameter applies only to system-initiated shard splits.

For more information, see [DB cluster parameter groups for Amazon Aurora DB clusters](user-workingwithdbclusterparamgroups.md).

## Splitting a shard

To split a shard in a DB shard group, use the `rds_aurora.limitless_split_shard` function. This function starts a shard-split job
that runs asynchronously.

```nohighlight

SELECT rds_aurora.limitless_split_shard('subcluster_id');
```

Wait for the return of a job ID upon successful submission of the job, for example:

```nohighlight

SELECT rds_aurora.limitless_split_shard('3');

    job_id
---------------
 1691300000000
(1 row)
```

###### Note

Concurrent shard split operations are not supported. Execute each operation sequentially and
complete each operation before initiating another addition operation.

## Tracking shard splits

You can use the job ID to track a shard-split job. To describe a particular job and get more details about it, run the following query:

```nohighlight

SELECT * FROM rds_aurora.limitless_list_shard_scale_jobs(job_id);
```

For example:

```nohighlight

SELECT * FROM rds_aurora.limitless_list_shard_scale_jobs(1691300000000);

    job_id     |    action   |      job_details      | status  |    submission_time     |                  message
---------------+-------------+-----------------------+---------+------------------------+-------------------------------------------
 1691300000000 | SPLIT_SHARD | Split Shard 3 by User | SUCCESS | 2023-08-06 05:33:20+00 | Scaling job succeeded.                 +
               |             |                       |         |                        | New shard instance with ID 7 was created.
(1 row)
```

The query returns an error when you pass a nonexistent job as the input.

```nohighlight

SELECT * from rds_aurora.limitless_list_shard_scale_jobs(1691300000001);

ERROR:  no job found with the job ID provided
```

You can track the status of all shard-split jobs by using the same query without a job ID, for example:

```nohighlight

SELECT * FROM rds_aurora.limitless_list_shard_scale_jobs();

    job_id     |   action    |  job_details          |   status    |    submission_time     |                  message
---------------+-------------+-----------------------+-------------+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------
 1691200000000 | SPLIT_SHARD | Split Shard 3 by User | IN_PROGRESS | 2023-08-05 01:46:40+00 |
 1691300000000 | SPLIT_SHARD | Split Shard 4 by User | SUCCESS     | 2023-08-06 05:33:20+00 | Scaling job succeeded. +
               |             |                       |             |                        | New shard instance with ID 7 was created.
 1691400000000 | SPLIT_SHARD | Split Shard 5 by User | FAILED      | 2023-08-07 09:20:00+00 | Error occurred for the add shard job 1691400000000.
               |             |                       |             |                        | Retry the command. If the issue persists, contact AWS Support.
 1691500000000 | SPLIT_SHARD | Split Shard 5 by User | CANCELED    | 2023-08-07 09:20:00+00 | Scaling job was cancelled.
(4 rows)
```

The job status can be one of the following:

- `IN_PROGRESS` – The shard-split job has been submitted and is in progress. You can have only one job in progress at
a time.

- `PENDING` – The shard-split job is waiting for you to finalize it. For more information, see [Finalizing shard splits](#limitless-shard-split.finalize).

- `CANCELLATION_IN_PROGRESS` – The shard-split job is being canceled by the user.

- `CANCELED` – The shard-split job has been successfully canceled by the user or by the system.

- `SUCCESS` – The shard-split job completed successfully. The `message` field contains the instance ID of
the new shard.

- `FAILED` – The shard-split job failed. The `message` field contains the details of the failure and any
actions that can be taken as a followup to the failed job.

## Finalizing shard splits

Finalizing is the last step of the shard-split process. It causes some downtime. If you start a shard-split
job, then finalizing happens immediately after the job completes successfully.

Sometimes the system splits shards based on workload, when you've enabled system-initiated shard splits by using the
`rds_aurora.limitless_enable_auto_scale` parameter.

In this case, you can choose whether finalizing happens immediately, or at a time that you choose. You use the
`rds_aurora.limitless_finalize_split_shard_mode` DB cluster parameter to choose when it happens:

- If you set the value to `immediate`, it happens immediately.

- If you set the value to `user_initiated`, you have to finalize the shard-split job manually.

An RDS event is sent to you, and the status of the shard-split job is set to `PENDING`.

When set to `user_initiated`, you use the `rds_aurora.limitless_finalize_split_shard` function to finalize the
shard-split job:

```nohighlight

SELECT * FROM rds_aurora.limitless_finalize_split_shard(job_id);
```

###### Note

This function applies only to shard splits that are initiated by the system, not by you.

## Canceling a shard split

You can cancel a user-initiated or system-initiated shard split that's `IN_PROGRESS` or `PENDING`. You need the job ID
to cancel it.

```nohighlight

SELECT * from rds_aurora.limitless_cancel_shard_scale_jobs(job_id);
```

No output is returned unless there's an error. You can track the cancellation using a job-tracking query.
