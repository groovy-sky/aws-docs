## Usage notes

```nohighlight

1>EXEC sp_execute_postgresql 'create extension [ IF NOT EXISTS ] <extension name> [ WITH ] [SCHEMA schema_name] [VERSION version]';
2>go

```

The following example shows how to create an extension:

```nohighlight

1>EXEC sp_execute_postgresql 'create extension pg_stat_statements with schema sys version "1.10"';
2>go
```

Use the following command to access extension objects:

```nohighlight

1>select * from pg_stat_statements;
2>go

```

###### Note

If schema name is not provided explicitly during extension creation, by default the extensions are installed in the public schema.
You must provide the schema qualifier to access the extension objects as mentioned below:

```nohighlight

2>go
```
