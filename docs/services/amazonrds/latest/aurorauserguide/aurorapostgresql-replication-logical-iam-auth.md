# Configuring IAM authentication for logical replication connections

Starting with Aurora PostgreSQL versions 11 and higher, you can use AWS Identity and
Access Management (IAM) authentication for replication connections. This feature enhances
security by allowing you to manage database access using IAM roles instead of passwords.
It works at the cluster level and follows the same security model as standard IAM
authentication.

IAM authentication for replication connections is an opt-in feature. To enable it, set the `rds.iam_auth_for_replication` parameter to `1` in your DB cluster parameter group.
As this is a dynamic parameter, your DB cluster doesn't need to restart, enabling you to leverage IAM authentication with existing workloads without downtime. Before
enabling this feature, you must meet the [Prerequisites](#AuroraPostgreSQL.Replication.Logical.IAM-auth-prerequisites) listed below.

## Prerequisites

To use IAM authentication for replication connections, you need to meet all of the
following requirements:

- Your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster must be version 11 or later.

- On your publisher Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster:

- Enable IAM database authentication.

For more information, see [Enabling and disabling IAM database authentication](usingwithrds-iamdbauth-enabling.md).

- Enable logical replication by setting the
`rds.logical_replication` parameter to
`1`.

For more information, see [Setting up logical replication for your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster](aurorapostgresql-replication-logical-configure.md).

In logical replication, the publisher is the source Aurora PostgreSQL DB
cluster that sends data to subscriber clusters. For more information, see
[Overview of PostgreSQL logical replication with Aurora](aurorapostgresql-replication-logical.md).

###### Note

Both IAM authentication and logical replication must be enabled on your
publisher Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster. If either one isn't enabled, you can't use
IAM authentication for replication connections.

## Enabling IAM authentication for replication connections

Complete the following steps to enable IAM authentication for replication
connection.

1. Verify that your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster meets all prerequisites for
    IAM authentication with replication connections. For details, see [Prerequisites](#AuroraPostgreSQL.Replication.Logical.IAM-auth-prerequisites).

2. Configure the `rds.iam_auth_for_replication` parameter by
    modifying your DB cluster parameter group:

- Set the `rds.iam_auth_for_replication` parameter to
`1`. This dynamic parameter doesn't require a
reboot.

3. Connect to your database and grant the necessary roles to your replication
    user:

The following SQL commands grant the necessary roles to enable IAM
    authentication for replication connections:

```sql

   -- Grant IAM authentication role
GRANT rds_iam TO replication_user_name;
   -- Grant replication privileges
ALTER USER replication_user_name WITH REPLICATION;
```

After you complete these steps, the specified user must use IAM authentication for
replication connections.

###### Important

When you enable the feature, users with both `rds_iam` and
`rds_replication` roles must use IAM authentication for
replication connections. This applies whether the roles are assigned directly to
the user or inherited through other roles.

## Disabling IAM authentication for replication connections

You can disable IAM authentication for replication connections by using any of the
following methods:

- Set the `rds.iam_auth_for_replication` parameter to
`0` in your DB cluster parameter group

- Alternatively, you can disable either of these features on your
Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster:

- Disable logical replication by setting the
`rds.logical_replication` parameter to
`0`

- Disable IAM authentication

When you disable the feature, replication connections can use database passwords for
authentication if configured.

###### Note

Replication connections for users without the `rds_iam` role can use password
authentication even when the feature is enabled.

## Limitations and considerations

The following limitations and considerations apply when using IAM authentication
for replication connections.

- IAM authentication for replication connections is only available for
Aurora PostgreSQL versions 11 and higher.

- The publisher must support IAM authentication for replication
connections.

- The IAM authentication token expires after 15 minutes by default. You
might need to refresh long-running replication connections before the token
expires.
