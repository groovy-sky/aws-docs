failure

RDS-EVENT-0079

Amazon RDS has been unable to create credentials for enhanced monitoring
and this feature has been disabled. This is likely due to the
rds-monitoring-role not being present and configured correctly in your
account. Please refer to the troubleshooting section in the Amazon RDS
documentation for further details.

Enhanced Monitoring can't be enabled without the Enhanced Monitoring
IAM role. For information about creating the IAM role, see [To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS enhanced monitoring](user-monitoring-os-enabling.md#USER_Monitoring.OS.IAMRole).

disabled. This is likely due to the rds-monitoring-role not being
present and configured correctly in your account. Please refer to the
troubleshooting section in the Amazon RDS documentation for further
details.

Enhanced Monitoring was disabled because an error occurred during the
configuration change. It is likely that the Enhanced Monitoring IAM role
is configured incorrectly. For information about creating the enhanced
monitoring IAM role, see [To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS enhanced monitoring](user-monitoring-os-enabling.md#USER_Monitoring.OS.IAMRole).
