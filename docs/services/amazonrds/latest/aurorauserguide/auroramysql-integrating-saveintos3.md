# Saving data from an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster into text files in an Amazon S3 bucket

You can use the `SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3` statement to query data from an
Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster and save it into text files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. In
Aurora MySQL, the files are first stored on the local disk, and then exported to S3. After the
exports are done, the local files are deleted.

You can encrypt the Amazon S3 bucket using an Amazon S3 managed key (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS key (SSE-KMS: AWS managed key or
customer managed key).

The `LOAD DATA FROM S3` statement can use files created by the `SELECT INTO
            OUTFILE S3` statement to load data into an Aurora DB cluster. For more information,
see [Loading data into an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster from text files in an Amazon S3 bucket](auroramysql-integrating-loadfroms3.md).

###### Note

This feature isn't supported for Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters. It is supported
for Aurora Serverless v2 DB clusters.

You can also save DB cluster data and DB cluster snapshot data to Amazon S3 using the
AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or Amazon RDS API. For more information, see [Exporting DB cluster data to Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/export-cluster-data.html) and [Exporting DB cluster snapshot data to Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-export-snapshot.html).

## Giving Aurora MySQL access to Amazon S3

Before you can save data into an Amazon S3 bucket, you must first give your Aurora MySQL DB
cluster permission to access Amazon S3.

###### To give Aurora MySQL access to Amazon S3

1. Create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that provides the bucket and object permissions that allow
    your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to access Amazon S3. For instructions, see
    [Creating an IAM policy to access Amazon S3 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Integrating.Authorizing.IAM.S3CreatePolicy.html).

###### Note

In Aurora MySQL version 3.05 and higher, you can encrypt objects using AWS KMS customer managed keys. To do so, include the
`kms:GenerateDataKey` permission in your IAM policy. For more information, see [Creating an IAM policy to access AWS KMS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Integrating.Authorizing.IAM.KMSCreatePolicy.html).

You don't need this permission to encrypt objects using AWS managed keys or Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).

2. Create an IAM role, and attach the IAM policy you created in [Creating an IAM policy to access Amazon S3 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Integrating.Authorizing.IAM.S3CreatePolicy.html) to the new IAM role.
    For instructions, see [Creating an IAM role to allow Amazon Aurora to access AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Integrating.Authorizing.IAM.CreateRole.html).

3. For Aurora MySQL version 2, set either the `aurora_select_into_s3_role` or
    `aws_default_s3_role` DB cluster parameter to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the new IAM role. If an
    IAM role isn't specified for `aurora_select_into_s3_role`, Aurora uses the IAM role specified in
    `aws_default_s3_role`.

For Aurora MySQL version 3, use `aws_default_s3_role`.

If the cluster is part of an Aurora global database,
    set this parameter for each Aurora cluster in the global database.

For more information about DB cluster parameters, see [Amazon Aurora DB cluster and DB instance parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_WorkingWithDBClusterParamGroups.html#Aurora.Managing.ParameterGroups).

4. To permit database users in an Aurora MySQL DB cluster to access Amazon S3, associate the role that you
    created in [Creating an IAM role to allow Amazon Aurora to access AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Integrating.Authorizing.IAM.CreateRole.html) with the DB cluster.

For an Aurora global database, associate the role with each Aurora cluster in the global database.

For information about associating an IAM role with a DB cluster, see
    [Associating an IAM role with an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Integrating.Authorizing.IAM.AddRoleToDBCluster.html).

5. Configure your Aurora MySQL DB cluster to allow outbound connections to Amazon S3. For instructions, see
    [Enabling network communication from Amazon Aurora to other AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Integrating.Authorizing.Network.html).

    For an Aurora global database, enable outbound connections for each Aurora cluster in the global database.

## Granting privileges to save data in Aurora MySQL

The database user that issues the `SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3` statement must have a specific role or privilege. In
Aurora MySQL version 3, you grant the `AWS_SELECT_S3_ACCESS` role. In Aurora MySQL version 2, you grant the `SELECT
                INTO S3` privilege. The administrative user for a DB cluster is granted the appropriate role or privilege by default.
You can grant the privilege to another user by using one of the following statements.

Use the following statement for Aurora MySQL version 3:

```sql

GRANT AWS_SELECT_S3_ACCESS TO 'user'@'domain-or-ip-address'
```

###### Tip

When you use the role technique in Aurora MySQL version 3, you can also activate the role by
using the `SET ROLE role_name` or `SET ROLE
                ALL` statement. If you aren't familiar with the MySQL 8.0 role system, you can
learn more in [Role-based privilege model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Compare-80-v3.html#AuroraMySQL.privilege-model). For more details, see [Using roles](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/roles.html) in the
_MySQL Reference Manual_.

This only applies to the current active session. When you reconnect, you must run the
`SET ROLE` statement again to grant privileges. For more information, see
[SET ROLE\
statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/set-role.html) in the _MySQL Reference Manual_.

You can use the `activate_all_roles_on_login` DB cluster parameter to
automatically activate all roles when a user connects to a DB instance. When this
parameter is set, you generally don't have to call the `SET ROLE` statement
explicitly to activate a role. For more information, see [activate\_all\_roles\_on\_login](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html) in the _MySQL Reference_
_Manual_.

However, you must call `SET ROLE ALL` explicitly at the beginning of a
stored procedure to activate the role, when the stored procedure is called by a
different user.

Use the following statement for Aurora MySQL version 2:

```sql

GRANT SELECT INTO S3 ON *.* TO 'user'@'domain-or-ip-address'
```

The `AWS_SELECT_S3_ACCESS` role and `SELECT INTO S3` privilege are specific to Amazon Aurora MySQL and
are not available for MySQL databases or RDS for MySQL DB instances. If you have set up replication between an Aurora MySQL DB
cluster as the replication source and a MySQL database as the replication client, then the `GRANT` statement for the
role or privilege causes replication to stop with an error. You can safely skip the error to resume replication. To skip the
error on an RDS for MySQL DB instance, use the [mysql\_rds\_skip\_repl\_error](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/mysql_rds_skip_repl_error.html) procedure. To skip the error on an external MySQL database, use the [slave\_skip\_errors](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-replica.html) system variable (Aurora MySQL version 2) or [replica\_skip\_errors](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-replica.html) system variable (Aurora MySQL version 3).

## Specifying a path to an Amazon S3 bucket

The syntax for specifying a path to store the data and manifest files on an Amazon S3
bucket is similar to that used in the `LOAD DATA FROM S3 PREFIX`
statement, as shown following.

```nohighlight

s3-region://bucket-name/file-prefix
```

The path includes the following values:

- `region` (optional) – The AWS Region that contains the
Amazon S3 bucket to save the data into. This value is optional. If you don't
specify a `region` value, then Aurora saves your files into Amazon S3
in the same region as your DB cluster.

- `bucket-name` – The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to save the
data into. Object prefixes that identify a virtual folder path are
supported.

- `file-prefix` – The Amazon S3 object prefix that identifies
the files to be saved in Amazon S3.

The data files created by the `SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3` statement use
the following path, in which `00000` represents a 5-digit,
zero-based integer number.

```nohighlight

s3-region://bucket-name/file-prefix.part_00000
```

For example, suppose that a `SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3` statement
specifies `s3-us-west-2://bucket/prefix` as the path in which to store
data files and creates three data files. The specified Amazon S3 bucket contains the
following data files.

- s3-us-west-2://bucket/prefix.part\_00000

- s3-us-west-2://bucket/prefix.part\_00001

- s3-us-west-2://bucket/prefix.part\_00002

## Creating a manifest to list data files

You can use the `SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3` statement with the
`MANIFEST ON` option to create a manifest file in JSON format that
lists the text files created by the statement. The `LOAD DATA FROM S3`
statement can use the manifest file to load the data files back into an Aurora MySQL DB
cluster. For more information about using a manifest to load data files from Amazon
S3 into an Aurora MySQL DB cluster, see [Using a manifest to specify data files to load](auroramysql-integrating-loadfroms3.md#AuroraMySQL.Integrating.LoadFromS3.Manifest).

The data files included in the manifest created by the `SELECT INTO OUTFILE
                    S3` statement are listed in the order that they're created by the
statement. For example, suppose that a `SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3` statement
specified `s3-us-west-2://bucket/prefix` as the path in which to store
data files and creates three data files and a manifest file. The specified Amazon S3
bucket contains a manifest file named
`s3-us-west-2://bucket/prefix.manifest`, that contains the following
information.

```json

{
  "entries": [
    {
      "url":"s3-us-west-2://bucket/prefix.part_00000"
    },
    {
      "url":"s3-us-west-2://bucket/prefix.part_00001"
    },
    {
      "url":"s3-us-west-2://bucket/prefix.part_00002"
    }
  ]
}
```

## SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3

You can use the `SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3` statement to query data from a DB cluster and save it directly into
delimited text files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

Compressed files aren't supported. Encrypted files are supported starting in Aurora MySQL version 2.09.0.

### Syntax

```sql

SELECT
    [ALL | DISTINCT | DISTINCTROW ]
        [HIGH_PRIORITY]
        [STRAIGHT_JOIN]
        [SQL_SMALL_RESULT] [SQL_BIG_RESULT] [SQL_BUFFER_RESULT]
        [SQL_CACHE | SQL_NO_CACHE] [SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS]
    select_expr [, select_expr ...]
    [FROM table_references
        [PARTITION partition_list]
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [GROUP BY {col_name | expr | position}
        [ASC | DESC], ... [WITH ROLLUP]]
    [HAVING where_condition]
    [ORDER BY {col_name | expr | position}
         [ASC | DESC], ...]
    [LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
INTO OUTFILE S3 's3_uri'
[CHARACTER SET charset_name]
    [export_options]
    [MANIFEST {ON | OFF}]
    [OVERWRITE {ON | OFF}]
    [ENCRYPTION {ON | OFF | SSE_S3 | SSE_KMS ['cmk_id']}]

export_options:
    [FORMAT {CSV|TEXT} [HEADER]]
    [{FIELDS | COLUMNS}
        [TERMINATED BY 'string']
        [[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY 'char']
        [ESCAPED BY 'char']
    ]
    [LINES
        [STARTING BY 'string']
        [TERMINATED BY 'string']
]
```

### Parameters

The `SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3` statement uses the following required and optional parameters that are
specific to Aurora.

**s3-uri**

Specifies the URI for an Amazon S3 prefix to use. Use the syntax described in [Specifying a path to an Amazon S3 bucket](#AuroraMySQL.Integrating.SaveIntoS3.URI).

**FORMAT {CSV\|TEXT} \[HEADER\]**

Optionally saves the data in CSV format.

The `TEXT` option is the default and produces the existing MySQL export format.

The `CSV` option produces comma-separated data values. The CSV format follows the specification in
[RFC-4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180). If you specify the optional keyword
`HEADER`, the output file contains one header line. The labels in the header line correspond to
the column names from the `SELECT` statement. You can use the CSV files for training data models for
use with AWS ML services. For more information about using exported Aurora data with AWS ML services, see
[Exporting data to Amazon S3 for SageMaker AI model training (Advanced)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/mysql-ml.html#exporting-data-to-s3-for-model-training).

**MANIFEST {ON \| OFF}**

Indicates whether a manifest file is created in Amazon S3. The manifest file is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
file that can be used to load data into an Aurora DB cluster with the `LOAD DATA FROM S3 MANIFEST`
statement. For more information about `LOAD DATA FROM S3 MANIFEST`, see [Loading data into an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster from text files in an Amazon S3 bucket](auroramysql-integrating-loadfroms3.md).

If `MANIFEST ON` is specified in the query, the manifest file is created in Amazon S3 after all data
files have been created and uploaded. The manifest file is created using the following path:

```nohighlight

s3-region://bucket-name/file-prefix.manifest
```

For more information about the format of the manifest file's contents, see [Creating a manifest to list data files](#AuroraMySQL.Integrating.SaveIntoS3.Manifest).

**OVERWRITE {ON \| OFF}**

Indicates whether existing files in the specified Amazon S3 bucket are overwritten. If `OVERWRITE ON` is
specified, existing files that match the file prefix in the URI specified in `s3-uri` are overwritten.
Otherwise, an error occurs.

**ENCRYPTION {ON \| OFF \| SSE\_S3 \| SSE\_KMS \[' `cmk_id`'\]}**

Indicates whether to use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS,
including AWS managed keys and customer managed keys). The `SSE_S3` and `SSE_KMS` settings are
available in Aurora MySQL version 3.05 and higher.

You can also use the `aurora_select_into_s3_encryption_default` session variable instead of the
`ENCRYPTION` clause, as shown in the following example. Use either the SQL clause or the session
variable, but not both.

```nohighlight

set session set session aurora_select_into_s3_encryption_default={ON | OFF | SSE_S3 | SSE_KMS};
```

The `SSE_S3` and `SSE_KMS` settings are available in Aurora MySQL version 3.05 and
higher.

When you set `aurora_select_into_s3_encryption_default` to the following value:

- `OFF` – The default encryption policy of the S3 bucket is followed. The default
value of `aurora_select_into_s3_encryption_default` is `OFF`.

- `ON` or `SSE_S3` – The S3 object is encrypted using Amazon S3 managed keys
(SSE-S3).

- `SSE_KMS` – The S3 object is encrypted using an AWS KMS key.

In this case, you also include the session variable `aurora_s3_default_cmk_id`, for
example:

```nohighlight

set session aurora_select_into_s3_encryption_default={SSE_KMS};
set session aurora_s3_default_cmk_id={NULL | 'cmk_id'};
```

- When `aurora_s3_default_cmk_id` is `NULL`, the S3 object is encrypted
using an AWS managed key.

- When `aurora_s3_default_cmk_id` is a nonempty string `cmk_id`, the S3
object is encrypted using a customer managed key.

The value of `cmk_id` can't be an empty string.

When you use the `SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3` command, Aurora determines the encryption as
follows:

- If the `ENCRYPTION` clause is present in the SQL command, Aurora relies only on the value of
`ENCRYPTION`, and doesn't use a session variable.

- If the `ENCRYPTION` clause isn't present, Aurora relies on the value of the session
variable.

For more information, see [Using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)](../../../s3/latest/userguide/usingserversideencryption.md) and [Using server-side encryption\
withAWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS)](../../../s3/latest/userguide/usingkmsencryption.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

You can find more details about other parameters in [SELECT statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html) and [LOAD DATA\
statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/load-data.html), in the MySQL documentation.

### Considerations

The number of files written to the Amazon S3 bucket depends on the amount of data
selected by the `SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3` statement and the file size
threshold for Aurora MySQL. The default file size threshold is 6 gigabytes (GB). If the
data selected by the statement is less than the file size threshold, a single
file is created; otherwise, multiple files are created. Other considerations for
files created by this statement include the following:

- Aurora MySQL guarantees that rows in data files are not split across file
boundaries. For multiple files, the size of every data file except the
last is typically close to the file size threshold. However,
occasionally staying under the file size threshold results in a row
being split across two data files. In this case, Aurora MySQL creates a data
file that keeps the row intact, but might be larger than the file size
threshold.

- Because each `SELECT` statement in Aurora MySQL runs as an atomic transaction,
a `SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3` statement that selects a large
data set might run for some time. If the statement fails for any reason,
you might need to start over and issue the statement again. If the
statement fails, however, files already uploaded to Amazon S3 remain in the
specified Amazon S3 bucket. You can use another statement to upload the
remaining data instead of starting over again.

- If the amount of data to be selected is large (more than 25 GB), we recommend that you use multiple
`SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3` statements to save the data to Amazon S3. Each statement should select a
different portion of the data to be saved, and also specify a different `file_prefix` in the
`s3-uri` parameter to use when saving the data files. Partitioning the data to be selected with
multiple statements makes it easier to recover from an error in one statement. If an error occurs for one statement,
only a portion of data needs to be re-selected and uploaded to Amazon S3. Using multiple statements also helps to avoid a
single long-running transaction, which can improve performance.

- If multiple `SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3` statements that use
the same `file_prefix` in the `s3-uri` parameter
run in parallel to select data into Amazon S3, the behavior is
undefined.

- Metadata, such as table schema or file metadata, is not uploaded by
Aurora MySQL to Amazon S3.

- In some cases, you might re-run a `SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3`
query, such as to recover from a failure. In these cases, you must
either remove any existing data files in the Amazon S3 bucket with the same
file prefix specified in `s3-uri`, or include `OVERWRITE
                                  ON` in the `SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3` query.

The `SELECT INTO OUTFILE S3` statement returns a typical MySQL
error number and response on success or failure. If you don't have access to the
MySQL error number and response, the easiest way to determine when it's done is
by specifying `MANIFEST ON` in the statement. The manifest file is
the last file written by the statement. In other words, if you have a manifest
file, the statement has completed.

Currently, there's no way to directly monitor the progress of the `SELECT
                        INTO OUTFILE S3` statement while it runs. However, suppose that
you're writing a large amount of data from Aurora MySQL to Amazon S3 using this statement,
and you know the size of the data selected by the statement. In this case, you
can estimate progress by monitoring the creation of data files in Amazon S3.

To do so, you can use the fact that a data file is created in the specified
Amazon S3 bucket for about every 6 GB of data selected by the statement. Divide the
size of the data selected by 6 GB to get the estimated number of data files to
create. You can then estimate the progress of the statement by monitoring the
number of files uploaded to Amazon S3 while the statement runs.

### Examples

The following statement selects all of the data in the `employees`
table and saves the data into an Amazon S3 bucket that is in a different region from
the Aurora MySQL DB cluster. The statement creates data files in which each field is
terminated by a comma ( `,`) character and each row is terminated by a
newline ( `\n`) character. The statement returns an error if files
that match the `sample_employee_data` file prefix exist in the
specified Amazon S3 bucket.

```sql

SELECT * FROM employees INTO OUTFILE S3 's3-us-west-2://aurora-select-into-s3-pdx/sample_employee_data'
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
```

The following statement selects all of the data in the `employees`
table and saves the data into an Amazon S3 bucket that is in the same region as the
Aurora MySQL DB cluster. The statement creates data files in which each field is
terminated by a comma ( `,`) character and each row is terminated by a
newline ( `\n`) character, and also a manifest file. The statement
returns an error if files that match the `sample_employee_data` file
prefix exist in the specified Amazon S3 bucket.

```sql

SELECT * FROM employees INTO OUTFILE S3 's3://aurora-select-into-s3-pdx/sample_employee_data'
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
    MANIFEST ON;
```

The following statement selects all of the data in the `employees`
table and saves the data into an Amazon S3 bucket that is in a different region from
the Aurora DB cluster. The statement creates data files in which each field is
terminated by a comma ( `,`) character and each row is terminated by a
newline ( `\n`) character. The statement overwrites any existing files
that match the `sample_employee_data` file prefix in the specified
Amazon S3 bucket.

```sql

SELECT * FROM employees INTO OUTFILE S3 's3-us-west-2://aurora-select-into-s3-pdx/sample_employee_data'
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
    OVERWRITE ON;
```

The following statement selects all of the data in the `employees`
table and saves the data into an Amazon S3 bucket that is in the same region as the
Aurora MySQL DB cluster. The statement creates data files in which each field is
terminated by a comma ( `,`) character and each row is terminated by a
newline ( `\n`) character, and also a manifest file. The statement
overwrites any existing files that match the `sample_employee_data`
file prefix in the specified Amazon S3 bucket.

```sql

SELECT * FROM employees INTO OUTFILE S3 's3://aurora-select-into-s3-pdx/sample_employee_data'
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
    MANIFEST ON
    OVERWRITE ON;
```
