# Rotating your SSL/TLS certificate

Amazon RDS Certificate Authority certificates rds-ca-2019 expired in
August, 2024. If you use or plan to use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport
Layer Security (TLS) with certificate verification to connect to your RDS DB
instances ,consider using one of the new CA certificates
rds-ca-rsa2048-g1, rds-ca-rsa4096-g1 or rds-ca-ecc384-g1.
If you currently do not use SSL/TLS with
certificate verification, you might still have an expired CA certificate and
must update them to a new CA certificate if you plan to use SSL/TLS with
certificate verification to connect to your RDS databases.

Amazon RDS provides new CA certificates as an AWS security best practice. For
information about the new certificates and the supported AWS Regions, see
[Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster](usingwithrds-ssl.md)
.

To update the CA certificate for your database, use the following methods:

- [Updating your CA certificate by modifying your DB instance](#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating)

- [Updating your CA certificate by applying maintenance](#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-maintenance-update)

Before you update your DB instances to use the new CA certificate, make sure that you update
your clients or applications connecting to your RDS databases.

## Considerations for rotating certificates

Consider the following situations before rotating your certificate:

- Amazon RDS Proxy and Aurora Serverless v1
use

certificates from the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). If you're using RDS Proxy, when
you rotate your SSL/TLS certificate, you don't need to update
applications that use RDS Proxy connections. For more information, see
[Using TLS/SSL with RDS Proxy](rds-proxy-howitworks.md#rds-proxy-security.tls)
.

- If you're using Aurora Serverless v1, downloading Amazon RDS certificates
isn't required. For more information, see [Using TLS/SSL with Aurora Serverless v1](aurora-serverless.md#aurora-serverless.tls)
.

- If you're using a Go version 1.15 application with a DB instance
that was created
or updated to the rds-ca-2019 certificate prior to July 28, 2020,
you must update the certificate again. Update the certificate to
rds-ca-rsa2048-g1, rds-ca-rsa4096-g1,
or rds-ca-ecc384-g1 depending on your engine
.

Use the `modify-db-instance` command ,
using the new CA certificate identifier. You can find the CAs that
are available for a specific DB engine and DB engine version using
the `describe-db-engine-versions` command.

If you created your database or updated its certificate after July
28, 2020, no action is required. For more information, see [Go GitHub issue\
#39568](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/39568).

## Updating your CA certificate by modifying your DB instance

The following example updates your CA certificate from
_rds-ca-2019_ to
_rds-ca-rsa2048-g1_.You can
choose a different certificate. For more information, see [Certificate authorities](usingwithrds-ssl.md#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities)
.

Update your application trust store to reduce any down time associated
with updating your CA certificate. For more information about restarts
associated with CA certificate rotation, see [Automatic server certificate rotation](#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-server-cert-rotation)
.

###### To update your CA certificate by modifying your DB instance

1. Download the new SSL/TLS certificate as described in [Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster](usingwithrds-ssl.md)
.

2. Update your applications to use the new SSL/TLS
    certificate.

The methods for updating applications for new SSL/TLS certificates
    depend on your specific applications. Work with your application
    developers to update the SSL/TLS certificates for your
    applications.

For information about checking for SSL/TLS connections and
    updating applications for each DB engine, see the following
    topics:

- [Updating applications to connect to Aurora MySQL DB clusters using new TLS certificates](ssl-certificate-rotation-aurora-mysql.md)

- [Updating applications to connect to Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters using new SSL/TLS certificates](ssl-certificate-rotation-aurora-postgresql.md)

For a sample script that updates a trust
store for a Linux operating system, see [Sample script for importing certificates into your trust store](#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-sample-script)
.

###### Note

The certificate bundle contains certificates for both the old
and new CA, so you can upgrade your application safely and
maintain connectivity during the transition period. If you are
using the AWS Database Migration Service to migrate a database to a DB
cluster, we recommend using the
certificate bundle to ensure connectivity during the
migration.

3. Modify the DB instance to change the CA from
**rds-ca-2019** to
**rds-ca-rsa2048-g1**. To check if your
    database requires a restart to update the CA certificates, use the
[describe-db-engine-versions](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-engine-versions.md) command and check the
`SupportsCertificateRotationWithoutRestart` flag.

###### Note

Reboot your Babelfish cluster after modifying to update
the CA certificate.

###### Important

If you are experiencing connectivity issues after certificate
expiry, use the apply immediately option by specifying
**Apply immediately** in the console or by
specifying the `--apply-immediately` option using the
AWS CLI. By default, this operation is scheduled to run during
your next maintenance window.

To set an override for your cluster
CA that's different from the default
RDS CA, use the [modify-certificates](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.md) CLI command.

You can use the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI to change the CA certificate from
**rds-ca-2019** to
**rds-ca-rsa2048-g1** for a DB instance .

Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
**Databases**, and then choose the
    DB instance that you want to modify.

3. Choose **Modify**.

![Modify DB instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ssl-rotate-cert-modify-aurora.png)

4. In the **Connectivity** section,
    choose **rds-ca-rsa2048-g1**.

![Choose CA certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ssl-rotate-cert-ca-rsa2048-g1.png)

5. Choose **Continue** and check the
    summary of modifications.

6. To apply the changes immediately, choose
**Apply immediately**.

7. On the confirmation page, review your changes. If they
    are correct, choose **Modify DB**
**Instance**
    to save your changes.

###### Important

When you schedule this operation, make sure that
you have updated your client-side trust store
beforehand.

Or choose **Back** to edit your
    changes or **Cancel** to cancel your
    changes.

AWS CLI

To use the AWS CLI to change the CA from
**rds-ca-2019** to
**rds-ca-rsa2048-g1** for a DB instance
, call the
[modify-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.md) or [modify-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster.md) command. Specify the DB instance
identifier
and the `--ca-certificate-identifier` option.

Use the `--apply-immediately` parameter to apply
the update immediately. By default, this operation is scheduled
to run during your next maintenance window.

###### Important

When you schedule this operation, make sure that you have
updated your client-side trust store beforehand.

###### Example

The following example modifies `mydbinstance`
by setting the CA certificate to
`rds-ca-rsa2048-g1`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
    --ca-certificate-identifier rds-ca-rsa2048-g1
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance ^
    --ca-certificate-identifier rds-ca-rsa2048-g1
```

###### Note

If your instance requires reboot, you can use the
[modify-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.md) CLI command and specify
the `--no-certificate-rotation-restart`
option.

## Updating your CA certificate by applying maintenance

Perform the following steps to update your CA certificate by applying
maintenance.

Console

###### To update your CA certificate by applying maintenance

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Certificate**
**update**.

![Certificate rotation navigation pane option](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ssl-rotate-cert-certupdate.png)

The **Databases requiring certificate**
**update** page appears.

![Update CA certificate for database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ssl-rotate-cert-update-multiple.png)

###### Note

This page only shows the DB instances for
the current AWS Region. If you have databases in
more than one AWS Region, check this page in each
AWS Region to see all DB instances with old
SSL/TLS certificates.

3. Choose the DB instance that you want to update.

You can schedule the certificate rotation for your
    next maintenance window by choosing
**Schedule**. Apply the rotation
    immediately by choosing **Apply**
**now**.

###### Important

If you experience connectivity issues after
certificate expiry, use the **Apply**
**now** option.

4. 1. If you choose **Schedule**,
          you are prompted to confirm the CA certificate
          rotation. This prompt also states the scheduled
          window for your update.

         ![Confirm certificate rotation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ssl-rotate-cert-confirm-schedule.png)

2. If you choose **Apply now**,
       you are prompted to confirm the CA certificate
       rotation.

      ![Confirm certificate rotation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ssl-rotate-cert-confirm-now.png)

###### Important

Before scheduling the CA certificate rotation on
your database, update any client applications that
use SSL/TLS and the server certificate to connect.
These updates are specific to your DB engine. After
you have updated these client applications, you can
confirm the CA certificate rotation.

To continue, choose the check box, and then choose
**Confirm**.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each DB instance that you
    want to update.

## Automatic server certificate rotation

If your root CA supports automatic server certificate rotation, RDS
automatically handles the rotation of the DB server certificate. RDS uses
the same root CA for this automatic rotation, so you don't need to download
a new CA bundle. See [Certificate authorities](usingwithrds-ssl.md#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities)
.

The rotation and validity of your DB server certificate depend on your DB
engine:

- If your DB engine supports rotation without restart, RDS
automatically rotates the DB server certificate without requiring
any action from you. RDS attempts to rotate your DB server
certificate in your preferred maintenance window at the DB server
certificate half life. The new DB server certificate is valid for 12
months.

- If your DB engine doesn't support rotation without restart, Amazon RDS
makes a `server-certificate-rotation` Pending Maintenance Action
visible via Describe-pending-maintenance-actions API, at the half life of the certificate, or at least 3 months before expiry.
You can apply the rotation using the apply-pending-maintenance-action API. The new DB server certificate is valid for 36 months.

Use the [describe-db-engine-versions](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-engine-versions.md) command and inspect the
`SupportsCertificateRotationWithoutRestart` flag to identify
whether the DB engine version supports rotating the certificate without
restart. For more information, see [Setting the CA for your database](usingwithrds-ssl.md#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities.Selection)
.

###### Important

For Amazon RDS for Oracle DB instances, you will see the `SupportsCertificateRotationWithoutRestart`
flag of the DB engine versions marked as `FALSE`. However, Amazon RDS for Oracle DB instances do NOT
require restart, but the database listener is restarted during the server certificate rotation.
Existing database connections are unaffected, but new connections will encounter errors for a
brief period while the listener is restarted. If you want to manually rotate the server certificate,
use the [apply-pending-maintenance-action](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/apply-pending-maintenance-action.md) AWS CLI command.

## Sample script for importing certificates into your trust store

The following are sample shell scripts that import the certificate bundle
into a trust store.

Each sample shell script uses keytool, which is part of the Java
Development Kit (JDK). For information about installing the JDK, see [JDK Installation Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/install/overview-jdk-installation.html).

Linux

The following is a sample shell script that imports the
certificate bundle into a trust store on a Linux operating
system.

```nohighlight

mydir=tmp/certs
if [ ! -e "${mydir}" ]
then
mkdir -p "${mydir}"
fi truststore=${mydir}/rds-truststore.jks storepassword=changeit

curl -sS "https://truststore.pki.rds.amazonaws.com/global/global-bundle.pem"> ${mydir}/global-bundle.pem
awk 'split_after == 1 {n++;split_after=0} /-----END CERTIFICATE-----/ {split_after=1}{print > "rds-ca-" n+1 ".pem"}' < ${mydir}/global-bundle.pem

for CERT in rds-ca-*; do alias=$(openssl x509 -noout -text -in $CERT | perl -ne 'next unless /Subject:/; s/.*(CN=|CN = )//; print')
  echo "Importing $alias"
  keytool -import -file ${CERT} -alias "${alias}" -storepass ${storepassword} -keystore ${truststore} -noprompt
  rm $CERT
done

rm ${mydir}/global-bundle.pem

echo "Trust store content is: "

keytool -list -v -keystore "$truststore" -storepass ${storepassword} | grep Alias | cut -d " " -f3- | while read alias
do expiry=`keytool -list -v -keystore "$truststore" -storepass ${storepassword} -alias "${alias}" | grep Valid | perl -ne 'if(/until: (.*?)\n/) { print "$1\n"; }'`
   echo " Certificate ${alias} expires in '$expiry'"
done

```

macOS

The following is a sample shell script that imports the
certificate bundle into a trust store on macOS.

```nohighlight

mydir=tmp/certs
if [ ! -e "${mydir}" ]
then
mkdir -p "${mydir}"
fi truststore=${mydir}/rds-truststore.jks storepassword=changeit

curl -sS "https://truststore.pki.rds.amazonaws.com/global/global-bundle.pem"> ${mydir}/global-bundle.pem
split -p "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" ${mydir}/global-bundle.pem rds-ca-

for CERT in rds-ca-*; do alias=$(openssl x509 -noout -text -in $CERT | perl -ne 'next unless /Subject:/; s/.*(CN=|CN = )//; print')
  echo "Importing $alias"
  keytool -import -file ${CERT} -alias "${alias}" -storepass ${storepassword} -keystore ${truststore} -noprompt
  rm $CERT
done

rm ${mydir}/global-bundle.pem

echo "Trust store content is: "

keytool -list -v -keystore "$truststore" -storepass ${storepassword} | grep Alias | cut -d " " -f3- | while read alias
do expiry=`keytool -list -v -keystore "$truststore" -storepass ${storepassword} -alias "${alias}" | grep Valid | perl -ne 'if(/until: (.*?)\n/) { print "$1\n"; }'`
   echo " Certificate ${alias} expires in '$expiry'"
done
