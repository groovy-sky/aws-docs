# Creating a cross-Region read replica DB cluster for Aurora MySQL

You can create an Aurora DB cluster that is a cross-Region read replica by using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface
(AWS CLI), or the Amazon RDS API. You can create cross-Region read replicas from both encrypted and unencrypted DB
clusters.

When you create a cross-Region read replica for Aurora MySQL by using the AWS Management Console, Amazon RDS creates a DB cluster in the target
AWS Region, and then automatically creates a DB instance that is the primary instance for that DB cluster.

When you create a cross-Region read replica using the AWS CLI or RDS API, you first create the DB cluster in the target
AWS Region and wait for it to become active. Once it is active, you then create a DB instance that is the primary instance
for that DB cluster.

Replication begins when the primary instance of the read replica DB cluster becomes available.

Use the following procedures to create a cross-Region read replica from an Aurora MySQL DB cluster. These
procedures work for creating read replicas from either encrypted or unencrypted DB clusters.

###### To create an Aurora MySQL DB cluster that is a cross-Region read replica with the AWS Management Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the top-right corner of the AWS Management Console, select the AWS Region that hosts your source DB cluster.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

4. Choose the DB cluster for which you want to create a cross-Region read replica.

5. For **Actions**, choose **Create cross-Region read replica**.

6. On the **Create cross region read replica** page, choose the option settings for your cross-Region
    read replica DB cluster, as described in the following table.

Option

Description

**Destination region**

Choose the AWS Region to host the new cross-Region read replica DB cluster.

**Destination DB subnet group**

Choose the DB subnet group to use for the cross-Region read replica DB cluster.

**Publicly accessible**

Choose **Yes** to give the cross-Region read replica DB cluster a public
IP address; otherwise, select **No**.

**Encryption**

Select **Enable Encryption** to turn on encryption at rest for this DB
cluster. For more information, see
[Encrypting Amazon Aurora resources](overview-encryption.md).

**AWS KMS key**

Only available if **Encryption** is set to **Enable**
**Encryption**. Select the AWS KMS key to use for encrypting this DB cluster. For
more information, see
[Encrypting Amazon Aurora resources](overview-encryption.md).

**DB instance class**

Choose a DB instance class that defines the processing and memory requirements for the
primary instance in the DB cluster. For more information about DB instance class options,
see
[Amazon AuroraDB instance classes](concepts-dbinstanceclass.md).

**Multi-AZ deployment**

Choose **Yes** to create a read replica of the new DB cluster in another Availability Zone
in the target AWS Region for failover support. For more information about multiple
Availability Zones, see [Regions and Availability Zones](concepts-regionsandavailabilityzones.md).

**Read replica source**

Choose the source DB cluster to create a cross-Region read replica for.

**DB instance identifier**

Type a name for the primary instance in your cross-Region read replica DB cluster. This
identifier is used in the endpoint address for the primary instance of the new DB cluster.

The DB instance identifier has the following constraints:

- It must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

- Its first character must be a letter.

- It cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

- It must be unique for all DB instances for each AWS account, for each AWS Region.

Because the cross-Region read replica DB cluster is created from a snapshot of the source
DB cluster, the master user name and master password for the read replica are the same as
the master user name and master password for the source DB cluster.

**DB cluster identifier**

Type a name for your cross-Region read replica DB cluster that is unique for your account in the target
AWS Region for your replica. This identifier is used in the cluster endpoint address
for your DB cluster. For information on the cluster endpoint, see [Amazon Aurora endpoint connections](aurora-overview-endpoints.md).

The DB cluster identifier has the following constraints:

- It must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

- Its first character must be a letter.

- It cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

- It must be unique for all DB clusters for each AWS account, for each AWS Region.

**Priority**

Choose a failover priority for the primary instance of the new DB cluster. This priority
determines the order in which Aurora Replicas are promoted when recovering from a primary
instance failure. If you don't select a value, the default is **tier-1**.
For more information, see
[Fault tolerance for an Aurora DB cluster](concepts-aurorahighavailability.md#Aurora.Managing.FaultTolerance).

**Database port**

Specify the port for applications and utilities to use to access the database. Aurora DB
clusters default to the default MySQL port, 3306. Firewalls at some companies block
connections to this port. If your company firewall blocks the default port, choose another
port for the new DB cluster.

**Enhanced monitoring**

Choose **Enable enhanced monitoring** to turn on gathering metrics in real
time for the operating system that your DB cluster runs on. For more information, see
[Monitoring OS metrics with Enhanced Monitoring](user-monitoring-os.md).

**Monitoring Role**

Only available if **Enhanced Monitoring** is set to **Enable**
**enhanced monitoring**. Choose the IAM role that you created to permit Amazon RDS to
communicate with Amazon CloudWatch Logs for you, or choose **Default** to have RDS
create a role for you named `rds-monitoring-role`. For more information, see
[Monitoring OS metrics with Enhanced Monitoring](user-monitoring-os.md).

**Granularity**

Only available if **Enhanced Monitoring** is set to **Enable**
**enhanced monitoring**. Set the interval, in seconds, between when metrics are
collected for your DB cluster.

**Auto minor version upgrade**

This setting doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL DB clusters.

For more information about engine updates for Aurora MySQL, see
[Database engine updates for Amazon Aurora MySQL](auroramysql-updates.md).

7. Choose **Create** to create your cross-Region read replica for Aurora.

###### To create an Aurora MySQL DB cluster that is a cross-Region read replica with the CLI

1. Call the AWS CLI [create-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster.md) command
    in the AWS Region where you want to create the
    read replica DB cluster. Include the `--replication-source-identifier` option and specify the
    Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source DB cluster to create a read replica for.

    For cross-Region replication where the DB cluster identified by
    `--replication-source-identifier` is encrypted, specify the
    `--kms-key-id` option and the `--storage-encrypted` option.

###### Note

You can set up cross-Region replication from an unencrypted DB cluster to an encrypted read
replica by specifying `--storage-encrypted` and providing a value for
`--kms-key-id`.

    You can't specify the `--master-username` and `--master-user-password`
    parameters. Those values are taken from the source DB cluster.

    The following code example creates a read replica in the us-east-1 Region from an unencrypted DB
    cluster snapshot in the us-west-2 Region. The command is called in the us-east-1 Region.
    This example specifies the `--manage-master-user-password` option to generate the master user password and manage it in Secrets Manager.
    For more information, see [Password management with Amazon Aurora and AWS Secrets Manager](rds-secrets-manager.md).
    Alternatively, you can use the `--master-password` option to specify and manage the password yourself.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster \
     --db-cluster-identifier sample-replica-cluster \
     --engine aurora-mysql \
     --engine-version 8.0.mysql_aurora.3.08.0 \
     --replication-source-identifier arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:sample-master-cluster

```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

     --replication-source-identifier arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:sample-master-cluster

```

    The following code example creates a read replica in the us-east-1 Region from an encrypted DB
    cluster snapshot in the us-west-2 Region. The command is called in the us-east-1 Region.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

     --replication-source-identifier arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:sample-master-cluster \
     --kms-key-id my-us-east-1-key \
     --storage-encrypted

```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

     --engine aurora-mysql ^
     --engine-version 8.0.mysql_aurora.3.08.0 ^
     --replication-source-identifier arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:sample-master-cluster ^
     --kms-key-id my-us-east-1-key ^
     --storage-encrypted

```

The `--source-region` option is required for cross-Region
    replication between the AWS GovCloud (US-East) and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions,
    where the DB cluster identified by `--replication-source-identifier` is
    encrypted. For `--source-region`, specify the AWS Region of the source
    DB cluster.

If `--source-region` isn't specified, specify a
    `--pre-signed-url` value. A _presigned_
_URL_ is a URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for
    the `create-db-cluster` command that is called in the source
    AWS Region. To learn more about the `pre-signed-url` option, see [create-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster.md) in the _AWS CLI Command Reference_.

2. Check that the DB cluster has become available to use by using the AWS CLI
    [describe-db-clusters](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-clusters.md)
    command, as shown in the following example.

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier sample-replica-cluster
```

    When the **`describe-db-clusters`** results show a status of
    `available`, create the primary instance for the DB cluster so that replication can
    begin. To do so, use the AWS CLI
    [create-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.md)
    command as shown in the following example.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance \
     --db-cluster-identifier sample-replica-cluster \
     --db-instance-class db.r5.large \
     --db-instance-identifier sample-replica-instance \
     --engine aurora-mysql
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance ^
     --db-cluster-identifier sample-replica-cluster ^
     --db-instance-class db.r5.large ^
     --db-instance-identifier sample-replica-instance ^
     --engine aurora-mysql
```

    When the DB instance is created and available, replication begins. You can determine if the DB
    instance is available by calling the AWS CLI
    [describe-db-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.md)
    command.

###### To create an Aurora MySQL DB cluster that is a cross-Region read replica with the API

1. Call the RDS API [CreateDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbcluster.md) operation in the AWS Region where you want to create
    the read replica DB cluster. Include the `ReplicationSourceIdentifier`
    parameter and specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source DB cluster to
    create a read replica for.

    For cross-Region replication where the DB cluster identified by
    `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` is encrypted, specify the
    `KmsKeyId` parameter and set the `StorageEncrypted`
    parameter to `true`.

###### Note

You can set up cross-Region replication from an unencrypted DB cluster to an encrypted read
replica by specifying `StorageEncrypted` as `true` and providing a
value for `KmsKeyId`. In this case, you don't need to specify
`PreSignedUrl`.

    You don't need to include the `MasterUsername` and `MasterUserPassword`
    parameters, because those values are taken from the source DB cluster.

    The following code example creates a read replica in the us-east-1 Region from an unencrypted DB
    cluster snapshot in the us-west-2 Region. The action is called in the us-east-1 Region.

```nohighlight

```

For cross-Region replication between the AWS GovCloud (US-East) and
    AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions, where the DB cluster identified by
    `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` is encrypted, also specify the
    `PreSignedUrl` parameter. The presigned URL must be a valid request for
    the `CreateDBCluster` API operation that can be performed in the source
    AWS Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster to be replicated. The KMS key
    identifier is used to encrypt the read replica, and must be a KMS key valid for
    the destination AWS Region. To automatically rather than manually generate a
    presigned URL, use the AWS CLI [create-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster.md) command with the `--source-region` option
    instead.

2. Check that the DB cluster has become available to use by using the RDS API
    [DescribeDBClusters](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbclusters.md)
    operation, as shown in the following example.

```nohighlight

```

    When `DescribeDBClusters` results show a status of
    `available`, create the primary instance for the DB cluster so that replication can
    begin. To do so, use the RDS API
    [CreateDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbinstance.md)
    action as shown in the following example.

```nohighlight

```

    When the DB instance is created and available, replication begins. You can determine if the DB
    instance is available by calling the AWS CLI
    [DescribeDBInstances](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbinstances.md)
    command.

## Viewing Amazon Aurora MySQL cross-Region replicas

You can view the cross-Region replication relationships for your Amazon Aurora MySQL DB
clusters by calling the [describe-db-clusters](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-clusters.md) AWS CLI command or the [DescribeDBClusters](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbclusters.md) RDS API
operation. In the response, refer to the `ReadReplicaIdentifiers` field for the
DB cluster identifiers of any cross-Region read replica DB clusters. Refer to the
`ReplicationSourceIdentifier` element for the ARN of the source DB cluster that
is the replication source.
