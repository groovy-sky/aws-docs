# Example: Using logical replication with Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters

The following procedure shows you how to start logical replication between two
Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters. Both the publisher and the subscriber must be configured for
logical replication as detailed in [Setting up logical replication for your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster](aurorapostgresql-replication-logical-configure.md).

The Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster that's the designated publisher must also allow
access to the replication slot. To do so, modify the security group associated with the
Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster 's virtual public cloud (VPC) based on the Amazon VPC service.
Allow inbound access by adding the security group associated with the subscriber's
VPC to the publisher's security group. For more information, see [Control traffic to resources using\
security groups](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-securitygroups.md) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

With these preliminary steps complete, you can use PostgreSQL commands `CREATE
                PUBLICATION` on the publisher and the `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION` on the
subscriber, as detailed in the following procedure.

###### To start the logical replication process between two Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters

These steps assume that your Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters have a writer instance with
a database in which to create the example tables.

1. On the publisher Aurora PostgreSQL DB
    cluster
1. Create a table using the following SQL statement.

      ```nohighlight

      CREATE TABLE LogicalReplicationTest (a int PRIMARY KEY);
      ```

2. Insert data into the publisher database by using the following SQL
       statement.

      ```nohighlight

      INSERT INTO LogicalReplicationTest VALUES (generate_series(1,10000));
      ```

3. Verify that data exists in the table by using the following SQL
       statement.

      ```nohighlight

      SELECT count(*) FROM LogicalReplicationTest;
      ```

4. Create a publication for this table by using the `CREATE
                                      PUBLICATION` statement, as follows.

      ```nohighlight

      CREATE PUBLICATION testpub FOR TABLE LogicalReplicationTest;
      ```
2. On the subscriber Aurora PostgreSQL DB
    cluster
1. Create the same `LogicalReplicationTest` table on the
       subscriber that you created on the publisher, as follows.

      ```nohighlight

      CREATE TABLE LogicalReplicationTest (a int PRIMARY KEY);
      ```

2. Verify that this table is empty.

      ```nohighlight

      SELECT count(*) FROM LogicalReplicationTest;
      ```

3. Create a subscription to get the changes from the publisher. You need
       to use the following details about the publisher Aurora PostgreSQL DB
       cluster.

- **host** – The publisher
Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster's writer DB instance.

- **port** – The port on
which the writer DB instance is listening. The default for
PostgreSQL is 5432.

- **dbname** – The name of
the database.

```nohighlight

CREATE SUBSCRIPTION testsub CONNECTION
   'host=publisher-cluster-writer-endpoint port=5432 dbname=db-name user=user password=password'
   PUBLICATION testpub;

```

###### Note

Specify a password other than the prompt shown here as a security
best practice.

After the subscription is created, a logical replication slot is
created at the publisher.

4. To verify for this example that the initial data is replicated on the
       subscriber, use the following SQL statement on the subscriber
       database.

      ```nohighlight

      SELECT count(*) FROM LogicalReplicationTest;
      ```

Any further changes on the publisher are replicated to the subscriber.

Logical replication affects performance. We recommend that you turn off logical
replication after your replication tasks are complete.
