# Using pglogical to synchronize data across instances

All currently available Aurora PostgreSQL versions support the `pglogical`
extension. The pglogical extension predates the functionally similar logical replication feature
that was introduced by PostgreSQL in version 10. For more
information, see [Overview of PostgreSQL logical replication with Aurora](aurorapostgresql-replication-logical.md).

The `pglogical` extension supports logical replication between two or more
Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters.
It also supports replication
between different PostgreSQL versions, and between databases running on RDS for PostgreSQL DB
instances and Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters. The `pglogical` extension uses a
publish-subscribe model to replicate changes to tables and other objects, such as sequences,
from a publisher to a subscriber. It relies on a replication slot to ensure that changes are
synchronized from a publisher node to a subscriber node, defined as follows.

- The _publisher node_ is the Aurora PostgreSQL
DB cluster
that's the source of data to be replicated to other nodes. The publisher node defines
the tables to be replicated in a publication set.

- The _subscriber node_ is the Aurora PostgreSQL
DB cluster that
receives WAL updates from the publisher. The subscriber creates a subscription to connect to
the publisher and get the decoded WAL data. When the subscriber creates the subscription,
the replication slot is created on the publisher node.

Following, you can find information about setting up the `pglogical` extension.

## Requirements and limitations for the pglogical extension

All currently available releases of Aurora PostgreSQL support the
`pglogical` extension.

Both the publisher node and the subscriber node must be set up for logical
replication.

The tables that you want to replicate from a publisher to a subscriber must have the same
names and the same schema. These tables must also contain the same columns, and the columns
must use the same data types. Both publisher and subscriber tables must have the same primary
keys. We recommend that you use only the PRIMARY KEY as the unique constraint.

The tables on the subscriber node can have more permissive constraints than those on the
publisher node for CHECK constraints and NOT NULL constraints.

The `pglogical` extension provides features such as two-way replication that
aren't supported by the logical replication feature built into PostgreSQL (version 10 and
higher). For more information, see [PostgreSQL bi-directional replication using pglogical](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/postgresql-bi-directional-replication-using-pglogical).
