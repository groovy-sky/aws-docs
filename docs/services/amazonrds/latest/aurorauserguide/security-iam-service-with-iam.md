## Aurora identity-based policies

**Supports identity-based policies:** Yes.

Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you can attach to an identity, such as an IAM user, group of users, or role. These
policies control what actions users and roles can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. To learn how to create an identity-based
policy, see [Define custom IAM permissions with customer managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

With IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and
resources as well as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. To learn about all of the elements that you can use in a
JSON policy, see [IAM JSON\
policy elements reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

### Identity-based policy examples for Aurora

To view examples of Aurora identity-based policies,
see [Identity-based policy examples for Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html).

## Resource-based policies within Aurora

**Supports resource-based policies:** No.

Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource. Examples of resource-based policies are
IAM _role trust policies_ and Amazon S3 _bucket policies_. In services that support resource-based policies, service
administrators can use them to control access to a specific resource. For the resource where the policy is attached, the policy defines what actions
a specified principal can perform on that resource and under what conditions. You must [specify a principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html) in a resource-based policy. Principals
can include accounts, users, roles, federated users, or AWS services.

To enable cross-account access, you can specify an entire account or IAM entities
in another account as the principal in a resource-based policy. For more information, see [Cross account resource access in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-cross-account-resource-access.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

## Policy actions for Aurora

**Supports policy actions:** Yes.

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which **principal** can perform
**actions** on what **resources**, and under what **conditions**.

The `Action` element of a JSON policy describes the
actions that you can use to allow or deny access in a policy. Include actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.

Policy actions in Aurora use the following prefix before the action:
`rds:`. For example, to grant someone permission to describe
DB instances with the Amazon RDS `DescribeDBInstances` API operation, you include
the `rds:DescribeDBInstances` action in their policy. Policy statements must
include either an `Action` or `NotAction` element.
Aurora defines its own set of actions that describe tasks that you can
perform with this service.

To specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas as
follows.

```nohighlight

"Action": [
      "rds:action1",
      "rds:action2"
```

You can specify multiple actions using wildcards (\*). For example, to specify all
actions that begin with the word `Describe`, include the following
action.

```nohighlight

"Action": "rds:Describe*"
```

To see a list of Aurora actions, see [Actions Defined by Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonrds.html#amazonrds-actions-as-permissions) in the
_Service Authorization Reference_.

## Policy resources for Aurora

**Supports policy resources:** Yes.

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which **principal** can perform
**actions** on what **resources**, and under what **conditions**.

The `Resource` JSON policy element specifies the object or objects to which the action applies. As a best practice, specify a resource using its [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html). For actions that don't support resource-level permissions, use a wildcard (\*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.

```nohighlight

"Resource": "*"
```

The DB instance resource has the following Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

```nohighlight

arn:${Partition}:rds:${Region}:${Account}:{ResourceType}/${Resource}
```

For more information about the format of ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS service namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).

For example, to specify the `dbtest` DB instance in your statement, use
the following ARN.

```nohighlight

"Resource": "arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:db:dbtest"
```

To specify all DB instances that belong to a specific account, use the wildcard
(\*).

```nohighlight

"Resource": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:db:*"
```

Some RDS API operations, such as those for creating resources, can't be performed on
a specific resource. In those cases, use the wildcard (\*).

```nohighlight

"Resource": "*"
```

Many Amazon RDS API operations involve multiple resources. For example, `CreateDBInstance` creates a DB instance. You can specify that an
user must use a specific security group and parameter group when creating a DB instance. To specify multiple resources in a single statement,
separate the ARNs with commas.

```nohighlight

"Resource": [
      "resource1",
      "resource2"
```

To see a list of Aurora
resource types and their ARNs, see [Resources Defined by Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonrds.html#amazonrds-resources-for-iam-policies) in the _Service Authorization Reference_.
To learn with which actions you can specify the ARN of each resource, see [Actions Defined by Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonrds.html#amazonrds-actions-as-permissions).

## Policy condition keys for Aurora

**Supports service-specific policy condition keys:** Yes.

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which **principal** can perform
**actions** on what **resources**, and under what **conditions**.

The `Condition` element specifies when statements execute based on defined criteria. You can create conditional expressions that use [condition\
operators](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html), such as equals or less than, to match the condition in the
policy with values in the request. To see all AWS global
condition keys, see [AWS global condition context keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

Aurora defines its own set of condition keys and also supports using
some global condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see [AWS global condition\
context keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

All RDS API operations support the `aws:RequestedRegion` condition key.

To see a list of Aurora condition keys, see [Condition Keys for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonrds.html#amazonrds-policy-keys)
in the _Service Authorization Reference_. To learn with which actions and
resources you can use a condition key, see [Actions Defined by Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonrds.html#amazonrds-actions-as-permissions).

## Access control lists (ACLs) in Aurora

**Supports access control lists (ACLs):** No

Access control lists (ACLs) control which principals (account members, users, or roles) have permissions to access a resource. ACLs are
similar to resource-based policies, although they do not use the JSON policy document format.

## Attribute-based access control (ABAC) in policies with Aurora tags

**Supports attribute-based access control (ABAC) tags in policies:** Yes

Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an authorization strategy that defines permissions
based on attributes called tags. You can attach tags to IAM entities and AWS resources, then design ABAC policies to allow operations when the principal's tag matches the tag on the resource.

To control access based on tags, you provide tag information in the [condition element](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html) of a policy using the `aws:ResourceTag/key-name`,
`aws:RequestTag/key-name`, or `aws:TagKeys` condition keys.

If a service supports all three condition keys for every resource type, then the value is **Yes** for the service. If a service supports all three condition keys for only some resource types, then the value is **Partial**.

For more information about ABAC, see [Define permissions with ABAC authorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html) in the _IAM User Guide_. To view a tutorial with steps for setting up ABAC, see
[Use attribute-based access control (ABAC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

For more information about tagging
Aurora resources, see
[Specifying conditions: Using custom tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAM.SpecifyingCustomTags.html).
To view an example identity-based policy for limiting access to a resource based on
the tags on that resource, see [Grant permission for actions on a resource with a specific tag with two different values](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-create-and-modify-examples.html#security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-grant-permissions-tags).

## Using temporary credentials with Aurora

**Supports temporary credentials:** Yes.

Temporary credentials provide short-term access to AWS resources and are automatically created when you use federation or switch roles. AWS recommends that you
dynamically generate temporary credentials instead of using long-term access keys. For
more information, see [Temporary\
security credentials in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) and [AWS services\
that work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

## Forward access sessions for Aurora

**Supports forward access sessions:** Yes.

Forward access sessions (FAS) use the permissions of the principal calling an AWS service, combined with the requesting AWS service to make requests to downstream services. For policy details
when making FAS requests, see [Forward access sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_forward_access_sessions.html).

## Service roles for Aurora

**Supports service roles:** Yes.

A service role is an [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) that a service assumes to perform
actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For
more information, see [Create a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

###### Warning

Changing the permissions for a service role might break
Aurora functionality.
Edit service roles only when Aurora
provides guidance to do so.

## Service-linked roles for Aurora

**Supports service-linked roles:** Yes.

A service-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS service. The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf.
Service-linked roles appear in your AWS account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view,
but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.

For details about using Aurora service-linked roles,
see [Using service-linked roles for Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAM.ServiceLinkedRoles.html).
