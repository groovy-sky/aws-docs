# Creating a custom IAM policy for Performance Insights

For users who don't have either the `AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsReadOnly` or
`AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsFullAccess` policy, you can grant access to Performance Insights
by creating or modifying a user-managed IAM policy. When you attach the policy to an IAM
permission set or role, the recipient can use Performance Insights.

###### To create a custom policy

1. Open the IAM console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Policies**.

3. Choose **Create policy**.

4. On the **Create Policy** page, choose the
    **JSON** option.

5. Copy and paste the text provided in the _JSON policy_
_document_ section in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_
_Guide_ for [AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsReadOnly](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/amazonrdsperformanceinsightsreadonly.md)
    or [AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsFullAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/amazonrdsperformanceinsightsfullaccess.md)
    policy.

6. Choose **Review policy**.

7. Provide a name for the policy and optionally a description, and then choose
    **Create policy**.

You can now attach the policy to a permission set or role. The following procedure
assumes that you already have a user available for this purpose.

###### To attach the policy to a user

1. Open the IAM console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**.

3. Choose an existing user from the list.

###### Important

To use Performance Insights, make sure that you have access to Amazon RDS in addition to the custom policy.
For example, the `AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsReadOnly`
predefined policy provides read-only access to Amazon RDS. For more information,
see [Managing access using policies](usingwithrds-iam.md#security_iam_access-manage).

4. On the **Summary** page, choose **Add**
**permissions**.

5. Choose **Attach existing policies directly**. For
    **Search**, type the first few characters of your policy
    name, as shown in the following image.
