# Analyzing PostgreSQL logs using CloudWatch Logs Insights

With the PostgreSQL logs from your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster published as CloudWatch Logs, you
can use CloudWatch Logs Insights to interactively search and analyze your log data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
CloudWatch Logs Insights includes a query language, sample queries, and other tools
for analyzing your log data so that you can identify potential issues and verify
fixes. To learn more, see [Analyzing log data with\
CloudWatch Logs Insights](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/analyzinglogdata.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide_.
