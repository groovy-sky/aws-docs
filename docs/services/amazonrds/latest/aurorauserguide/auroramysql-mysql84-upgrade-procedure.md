# Upgrading to Aurora MySQL version 8.4

You can upgrade from Aurora MySQL version 3 to version 8.4 using an in-place major version upgrade. Direct upgrades from
Aurora MySQL version 2 to version 8.4 are not supported. If you are running version 2, you must first upgrade to version 3.

For general information about the major version upgrade process, see [Upgrading the major version of an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster](auroramysql-updates-majorversionupgrade.md).

## Before upgrading to version 8.4

Before you upgrade, complete the following preparation steps:

Aurora runs upgrade prechecks automatically before the upgrade begins. These prechecks identify
compatibility issues that can block the upgrade. For details about each precheck, see
[Precheck descriptions for upgrading Aurora MySQL version 3 to version 8.4](auroramysql-upgrade-prechecks-v3-to-v84-descriptions.md).

1. **Migrate authentication plugins.** Review all database users and migrate any
    users using `mysql_native_password` to `caching_sha2_password`. In Aurora MySQL version 8.4,
    the `mysql_native_password` plugin is still supported but deprecated. The default
    `authentication_policy` is `*:caching_sha2_password`, so new users are created with
    `caching_sha2_password` by default.

```sql

   -- Find users using mysql_native_password
SELECT user, host, plugin FROM mysql.user WHERE plugin = 'mysql_native_password';

   -- Migrate a user to caching_sha2_password
ALTER USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'new_password';
```

2. **Update replication SQL statements.** If your applications or scripts use
    deprecated replication statements (such as `SHOW SLAVE STATUS` or `CHANGE MASTER TO`),
    update them to use the replacement statements. These old statements return syntax errors in version 8.4.
    For the full list, see [Comparing Aurora MySQL version 3 and Aurora MySQL version 8.4](auroramysql-compare-v3-v84.md).

3. **Check for removed parameters.** If your custom parameter groups use any
    parameters that were removed in version 8.4 (such as `expire_logs_days` or
    `default_authentication_plugin`), create new MySQL 8.4–compatible parameter groups with the
    replacement parameters. Apply any necessary custom parameter values to the new parameter groups.
    For details, see [Comparing Aurora MySQL version 3 and Aurora MySQL version 8.4](auroramysql-compare-v3-v84.md).

4. **Check for incompatible SQL syntax.** Review your application code for
    removed syntax such as `LOW_PRIORITY` with `LOCK TABLES ... WRITE`, and
    `AUTO_INCREMENT` on `FLOAT` or `DOUBLE` columns.

5. **Check foreign key constraints.** If your schema uses foreign keys that reference
    non-unique keys, note that creating new such foreign keys is blocked by default in version 8.4. Existing foreign keys
    continue to work, but new ones require setting `restrict_fk_on_non_standard_key=OFF`.

6. **Check for new reserved keywords.** Verify that your database objects
    don't use any of the new reserved keywords added in MySQL 8.4 as unquoted identifiers.

7. **Test the upgrade.** We recommend testing the upgrade on a clone of your
    production cluster before upgrading the production cluster itself.

8. **Review security considerations.** For details about authentication plugin
    changes, TLS and cipher changes, password policies and the `validate_password` component,
    new dynamic privileges, and upgrade prechecks such as `deprecatedDefaultAuth` and
    `auroraValidatePasswordPluginCheck`, see
    [Security considerations for upgrading from Aurora MySQL version 3 to version 8.4](auroramysql-upgrade-v3-v84-security.md).

## How to upgrade to version 8.4

To perform the upgrade, follow the in-place major version upgrade procedure described in [Upgrading the major version of an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster](auroramysql-updates-majorversionupgrade.md).
Select the target version 8.4 engine version when modifying your DB cluster.

Alternatively, you can use a [Using Amazon Aurora Blue/Green Deployments for database updates](blue-green-deployments.md)
to upgrade with minimal downtime. A Blue/Green deployment creates a staging environment that runs the new version
alongside your current production environment, allowing you to test and validate before switching over.

After the upgrade completes, perform the post-upgrade cleanup steps described in [Post-upgrade cleanup for Aurora MySQL version 8.4](auroramysql-mysql84-post-upgrade.md).
