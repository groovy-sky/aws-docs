# Aurora zero-ETL integrations

An Aurora
zero-ETL integration with Amazon Redshift and Amazon SageMaker AI enables near real-time
analytics and machine learning (ML) using data from Aurora. It's a fully managed solution
for making transactional data available in your analytics destination after it is written to
an Aurora DB cluster. _Extract, transform,_ and _load_ (ETL) is the process of combining data from multiple
sources into a large, central data warehouse.

A zero-ETL integration makes the data in your Aurora DB cluster available in Amazon Redshift or an
Amazon SageMaker AI lakehouse in near real-time. Once that data is in the
target data warehouse or data lake, you can power your analytics, ML, and AI workloads using
the built-in capabilities, such as machine learning, materialized views, data sharing,
federated access to multiple data stores and data lakes, and integrations with Amazon SageMaker AI,
Quick, and other AWS services.

To create a zero-ETL integration, you specify an Aurora DB cluster as the
_source_, and a supported data warehouse or lakehouse as the
_target_. The integration replicates data from the source database into
the target data warehouse or lakehouse.

The integration monitors the health of the data pipeline and recovers from issues when
possible. You can create integrations from multiple Aurora DB clusters into a single target data
warehouse or lakehouse enabling you to derive insights across multiple applications.

## Benefits

Aurora
zero-ETL integrations have the following benefits:

- Help you derive holistic insights from multiple data sources.

- Eliminate the need to build and maintain complex data pipelines that perform
extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations. Zero-ETL integrations remove the
challenges that come with building and managing pipelines by provisioning and
managing them for you.

- Reduce operational burden and cost, and let you focus on improving your
applications.

- Let you leverage the target destination's analytics and ML capabilities to
derive insights from transactional and other data, to respond effectively to
critical, time-sensitive events.

## Key concepts

As you get started with zero-ETL integrations, consider the following concepts:

**Integration**

A fully managed data pipeline that automatically replicates transactional
data and schemas from an Aurora DB cluster to a data
warehouse or catalog.

**Source DB cluster**

The Aurora DB cluster where data is replicated from.
You can specify a DB cluster that
uses provisioned DB instances or Aurora Serverless v2 DB instances as the
source.

**Target**

The data warehouse or lakehouse where the data is replicated to. There are
two types of data warehouse: a [provisioned\
cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html) data warehouse and a [serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/serverless-workgroup-namespace.html) data warehouse. A provisioned cluster data warehouse
is a collection of computing resources called nodes, which are organized
into a group called a _cluster_. A serverless data
warehouse is comprised of a workgroup that stores compute resources, and a
namespace that houses the database objects and users. Both data warehouses
run an analytics engine and contain one or more databases.

A target lakehouse consists of catalogs, databases, tables, and views. For
more information about lakehouse architecture, see [SageMaker Lakehouse components](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-unified-studio/latest/userguide/lakehouse-components.html) in the _Amazon SageMaker AI Unified Studio User_
_Guide_.

Multiple source DB clusters can write to the same target.

For more information, see [Data warehouse\
system architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_high_level_system_architecture.html) in the _Amazon Redshift Developer_
_Guide_.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply to Aurora zero-ETL integrations.

###### Topics

- [General limitations](#zero-etl.reqs-lims-general)

- [Aurora MySQL limitations](#zero-etl.reqs-lims-mysql)

- [Aurora PostgreSQL limitations](#zero-etl.reqs-lims-apg)

- [Amazon Redshift limitations](#zero-etl.reqs-lims-redshift)

- [Amazon SageMaker AI lakehouse limitations](#zero-etl.reqs-lims-sagemaker-)

### General limitations

- The source DB cluster must be in the same
Region as the target.

- You can't rename a DB cluster or any of its instances if it has
existing integrations.

- You can't create multiple integrations between the same source and target
databases.

- You can't delete a DB cluster that has existing integrations. You must
delete all associated integrations first.

- If you stop the source DB cluster, the last
few transactions might not be replicated to the target until you resume the
cluster.

- If your cluster is the source of a blue/green
deployment, the blue and green environments can't have existing
zero-ETL integrations during switchover. You must delete the integration first and
switch over, then recreate it.

- A DB cluster must contain at least one DB instance in order to be the source of an
integration.

- You can't create an integration for a source DB cluster that is a cross-account
clone, such as those shared using AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM).

- If your source cluster is the primary DB cluster in an Aurora global database
and it fails over to one of its secondary clusters, the integration becomes
inactive. You must delete and recreate the integration.

- You can't create an integration for a source database that has another
integration being actively created.

- When you initially create an integration, or when a table is being
resynchronized, data seeding from the source to the target can take 20-25
minutes or more depending on the size of the source database. This delay can
lead to increased replica lag.

- Some data types aren't supported. For more information, see [Data type differences between Aurora and Amazon Redshift databases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/zero-etl.querying.html#zero-etl.data-type-mapping).

- System tables, temporary tables, and views aren't replicated to target
warehouses.

- Performing DDL commands (for example `ALTER TABLE`) on a source
table can trigger a table resynchronization, making the table unavailable
for querying while it's resynchronizing. For more information, see [One or more of my Amazon Redshift tables requires a resync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/zero-etl.troubleshooting.html#zero-etl.troubleshooting.resync).

### Aurora MySQL limitations

- Your source DB cluster must be running a supported version of Aurora MySQL. For a
list of supported versions, see [Supported Regions and Aurora DB engines for zero-ETL integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.Zero-ETL.html).

- Zero-ETL integrations rely on MySQL binary logging (binlog) to capture ongoing
data changes. Don't use binlog-based data filtering, as it can cause data
inconsistencies between the source and target databases.

- Zero-ETL integrations are supported only for databases configured to use the
InnoDB storage engine.

- Foreign key references with predefined table updates aren't supported.
Specifically, `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` rules aren't
supported with `CASCADE`, `SET NULL`, and `SET
                              DEFAULT` actions. Attempting to create or update a table with such
references to another table will put the table into a failed state.

- [XA\
transactions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/xa.html) performed on the source DB cluster cause the integration
to enter a state of `Syncing`.

### Aurora PostgreSQL limitations

- Your source DB cluster must be running a supported version of Aurora PostgreSQL.
For a list of supported versions, see [Supported Regions and Aurora DB engines for zero-ETL integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.Zero-ETL.html).

- If you select an Aurora PostgreSQL source DB cluster, you must specify at least one
data filter pattern. At minimum, the pattern must include a single database
( `database-name.*.*`) for
replication to the target warehouse. For more information, see [Data filtering for Aurora zero-ETL integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/zero-etl.filtering.html).

- All databases created within the source Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster must use UTF-8
encoding.

- When using declarative partitioning, the table partitions will be replicated to Amazon Redshift.
However, the partitioned table itself isn't replicated to Amazon Redshift.

- [Two-phase transactions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/two-phase.html) aren't supported.

- If you delete all DB instances from a DB cluster that is the source of an integration
and then re-add a DB instance, replication breaks between the source and the
target clusters.

- The source DB cluster can't use Aurora Limitless Database.

- Primary keys are required on all tables present in the data filter.
Any tables without a primary key will be put into the failed state.

### Amazon Redshift limitations

For a list of Amazon Redshift limitations related to zero-ETL integrations, see [Considerations when using zero-ETL integrations with Amazon Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/zero-etl.reqs-lims.html) in
