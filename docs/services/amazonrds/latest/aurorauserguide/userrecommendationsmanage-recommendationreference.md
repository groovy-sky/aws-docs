Storage encryption is turned off

Amazon RDS supports encryption at rest for all the database engines by
using the keys that you manage in AWS Key Management Service
(AWS KMS). On an active DB instance with Amazon RDS encryption, the data
stored at rest in the storage is encrypted, similar to automated
backups, read replicas, and snapshots.

If encryption isn't turned on while creating an Aurora DB cluster, you
must restore a decrypted snapshot to an encrypted DB cluster.

Turn on encryption of data at rest for your DB cluster.

DB clusters with all reader instances in the same Availability
Zone

Availability Zones (AZs) are locations that are distinct from
each other to provide isolation in case of outages within each AWS
Region. We recommend that you distribute the primary instance and
reader instances in your DB cluster across multiple AZs to improve the
availability of your DB cluster. You can create a Multi-AZ cluster using
the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or Amazon RDS API when you
create the cluster. You can modify the existing Aurora cluster to a
Multi-AZ cluster by adding a new reader instance and specifying a
different AZ.

Your DB cluster has all of its read instances in the same
Availability Zone. We recommend that you distribute the reader
instances across multiple Availability Zones. Distribution increases
availability and improves response time by reducing network latency
between clients and the database.

No

[High availability for Amazon Aurora](concepts-aurorahighavailability.md)

DB memory parameters are diverging from default

The memory parameters of the DB instances are significantly different
from the default values. These settings can impact performance and
cause errors.

We recommend that you reset the custom memory parameters for the
DB instance to their default values in the DB parameter group.

Reset the memory parameters to their default
values.

No

[Parameter groups for Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups.md)

Query cache parameter is turned on

When changes require that your query cache is purged, your DB instance will appear to stall. Most
workloads don't benefit from a query cache. The query cache was
removed from MySQL 8.0 and higher versions. We recommend that you
set the query\_cache\_type parameter to 0.

Set the `query_cache_type` parameter value to
`0` in your DB parameter groups.

Yes

[Parameter groups for Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups.md)

`log_output` parameter is set to
table

When `log_output` is set to `TABLE`, more storage is used than when
`log_output` is set to `FILE`. We
recommend that you set the parameter to `FILE`, to avoid
reaching the storage size limit. Set to `FILE` by default
in MySQL 8.4 and higher versions.

Set the `log_output` parameter value to
`FILE` in your DB parameter groups.

No

`innodb_stats_persistent` parameter is turned
off

Your DB instance isn't configured to persist the InnoDB statistics to
the disk. When the statistics aren't stored, they are recalculated
each time the instance restarts and the table accessed. This leads
to variations in the query execution plan. You can modify the value
of this global parameter at the table level.

We recommend that you set the `innodb_stats_persistent`
parameter value to `ON`.

Set the `innodb_stats_persistent` parameter value to
`ON`.

No

`innodb_default_row_format` parameter setting is
unsafe

Your DB instance encounters a known issue: A table created in a MySQL
version lower than 8.0.26 with the `row_format` set to
`COMPACT` or `REDUNDANT` will be
inaccessible and unrecoverable when the index exceeds 767
bytes.

We recommend that you set the
`innodb_default_row_format` parameter value to
`DYNAMIC`.

DB cluster under-provisioned for read workload

We recommend that you add a reader DB instance to your DB cluster with the
same instance class and size as the writer DB instance in the cluster. The
current configuration has one DB instance with a continuously high
database load caused mostly by read operations. Distribute these
operations by adding another DB instance to the cluster and directing the
read workload to the DB cluster read-only endpoint.

Add a reader DB instance to the cluster.

RDS resources are not utilizing connection pooling
correctly

We recommend that you enable Amazon RDS Proxy to efficiently pool
and share existing database connections. If you are already using a
proxy for your database, configure it correctly to improve
connection pooling and load balancing across multiple DB instances.
RDS Proxy can help reduce the risk of connection exhaustion and
downtime while improving availability and
scalability.

Enable RDS Proxy or modify your existing proxy
configuration
