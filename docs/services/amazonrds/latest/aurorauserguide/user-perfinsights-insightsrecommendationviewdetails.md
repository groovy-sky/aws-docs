# Viewing Performance Insights proactive recommendations

Amazon RDS Performance Insights monitors specific metrics and automatically creates thresholds by analyzing what levels might be
potentially problematic for a specified resource. When the new metric values cross a predefined threshold over a
given period of time, Performance Insights generates a proactive recommendation. This recommendation helps to prevent future database
performance impact. To receive these proactive recommendations, you must turn on Performance Insights with a paid tier retention period.

For more information about turning on Performance Insights, see [Turning Performance Insights on and off for Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.Enabling.html). For information about pricing and data
retention for Performance Insights, see [Pricing and data retention for Performance Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.Overview.cost.html).

To find out the regions, DB engines, and instance classes supported for the proactive recommendations, see
[Amazon Aurora DB engine, Region, and instance class support for Performance Insights features](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.Overview.Engines.html#USER_PerfInsights.Overview.PIfeatureEngnRegSupport).

You can view the detailed analysis and recommended investigations of proactive recommendations in the recommendation details page.

###### To view the detailed analysis of a proactive recommendation

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, do any of the following:

- Choose **Recommendations**.

The **Recommendations** page displays a list of
recommendations sorted by the severity for all the resources in your
account.

The **Recommendations** tab displays the recommendations and its details for the selected resource.

The recommendation details page appears. The title provides the name of the affected resource with the issue detected and the severity.

the metric reported from the issue start time.
