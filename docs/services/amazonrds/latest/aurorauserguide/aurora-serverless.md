# Using Amazon Aurora Serverless v1

###### Important

AWS has [announced the end-of-life date for Aurora Serverless v1: March 31st, 2025](https://repost.aws/questions/QUhcMVoChXRm2HLi8F-yih1g/announcement-support-for-aurora-s/announcement-support-for-aurora-serverless-v1-ending-soon). All Aurora Serverless v1 clusters that are
not migrated by March 31, 2025 will be migrated to Aurora Serverless v2 during the maintenance window. If the upgrade fails, Amazon Aurora converts the Serverless v1
cluster to a provisioned cluster with the equivalent engine version during the maintenance window. If applicable, Amazon Aurora will enroll the
converted provisioned cluster in Amazon RDS Extended Support. For more information, see [Amazon RDS Extended Support with Amazon Aurora](extended-support.md).

Amazon Aurora Serverless v1 (Amazon Aurora Serverless version 1) is an on-demand autoscaling configuration for
Amazon Aurora. An _Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster_ is a DB cluster that scales compute capacity up
and down based on your application's needs. This contrasts with Aurora _provisioned DB_
_clusters_, for which you manually manage capacity. Aurora Serverless v1 provides a relatively simple,
cost-effective option for infrequent, intermittent, or unpredictable workloads. It is cost-effective because it
automatically starts up, scales compute capacity to match your application's usage, and shuts down when
it's not in use.

To learn more about pricing, see [Serverless Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/pricing)
under **MySQL-Compatible Edition** or **PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition** on the
Amazon Aurora pricing page.

Aurora Serverless v1 clusters have the same kind of high-capacity, distributed, and highly available storage
volume that is used by provisioned DB clusters.

For an Aurora Serverless v1 cluster, the cluster volume is always encrypted. You can choose the encryption key,
but you can't disable encryption. That means that you can perform the same operations on an
Aurora Serverless v1 that you can on encrypted snapshots. For more information, see
[Aurora Serverless v1 and snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v1.how-it-works.html#aurora-serverless.snapshots).

## Region and version availability for Aurora Serverless v1

Feature availability and support varies across specific versions of each Aurora database engine, and across AWS Regions.
For more information on version and Region availability with Aurora and Aurora Serverless v1, see
[Aurora Serverless v1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.ServerlessV1.html).

## Advantages of Aurora Serverless v1

Aurora Serverless v1 provides the following advantages:

- **Simpler than provisioned** – Aurora Serverless v1 removes much of the
complexity of managing DB instances and capacity.

- **Scalable** – Aurora Serverless v1 seamlessly scales compute and memory
capacity as needed, with no disruption to client connections.

- **Cost-effective** – When you use Aurora Serverless v1, you pay only for
the database resources that you consume, on a per-second basis.

- **Highly available storage** – Aurora Serverless v1 uses the same
fault-tolerant, distributed storage system with six-way replication as Aurora to protect against data loss.

## Use cases for Aurora Serverless v1

Aurora Serverless v1 is designed for the following use cases:

- **Infrequently used applications** – You have an application that is
only used for a few minutes several times per day or week, such as a low-volume blog site. With
Aurora Serverless v1, you pay for only the database resources that you consume on a per-second basis.

- **New applications** – You're deploying a new application and
you're unsure about the instance size you need. By using Aurora Serverless v1, you can create a
database endpoint and have the database autoscale to the capacity requirements of your application.

- **Variable workloads** – You're running a lightly used
application, with peaks of 30 minutes to several hours a few times each day, or several times per year.
Examples are applications for human resources, budgeting, and operational reporting applications. With
Aurora Serverless v1, you no longer need to provision for peak or average capacity.

- **Unpredictable workloads** – You're running daily workloads that
have sudden and unpredictable increases in activity. An example is a traffic site that sees a surge of
activity when it starts raining. With Aurora Serverless v1, your database autoscales capacity to meet the
needs of the application's peak load and scales back down when the surge of activity is over.

- **Development and test databases** – Your developers use databases
during work hours but don't need them on nights or weekends. With Aurora Serverless v1, your database
automatically shuts down when it's not in use.

- **Multi-tenant applications** – With Aurora Serverless v1, you
don't have to individually manage database capacity for each application in your fleet.
Aurora Serverless v1 manages individual database capacity for you.

## Limitations of Aurora Serverless v1

The following limitations apply to Aurora Serverless v1:

- ###### Important

AWS has [announced the end-of-life date for Aurora Serverless v1: March 31st, 2025](https://repost.aws/questions/QUhcMVoChXRm2HLi8F-yih1g/announcement-support-for-aurora-s/announcement-support-for-aurora-serverless-v1-ending-soon). All Aurora Serverless v1 clusters that are
not migrated by March 31, 2025 will be migrated to Aurora Serverless v2 during the maintenance window. If the upgrade fails, Amazon Aurora converts the Serverless v1
cluster to a provisioned cluster with the equivalent engine version during the maintenance window. If applicable, Amazon Aurora will enroll the
converted provisioned cluster in Amazon RDS Extended Support. For more information, see [Amazon RDS Extended Support with Amazon Aurora](extended-support.md).

- Aurora Serverless v1 doesn't support the following features:

- Aurora global databases

- Aurora Replicas

- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) database authentication

- Backtracking in Aurora

- Database activity streams

- Kerberos authentication

- Performance Insights

- RDS Proxy

- Viewing logs in the AWS Management Console

- Connections to an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster are closed automatically if held open for longer than one
day.

- All Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters have the following limitations:

- You can't export Aurora Serverless v1 snapshots to Amazon S3 buckets.

- You can't use AWS Database Migration Service and Change Data Capture (CDC) with Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters. Only
provisioned Aurora DB clusters support CDC with AWS DMS as a source.

- You can't save data to text files in Amazon S3 or load text file data to Aurora Serverless v1 from S3.

- You can't attach an IAM role to an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster. However, you can load data to
Aurora Serverless v1 from Amazon S3 by using the `aws_s3` extension with the
`aws_s3.table_import_from_s3` function and the `credentials` parameter. For more
information, see [Importing data from Amazon S3 into an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_PostgreSQL.S3Import.html).

- When using the query editor, a Secrets Manager secret is created for the DB credentials to access the database.
If you delete the credentials from the query editor, the associated secret is also deleted from Secrets Manager.
You can't recover this secret after it's deleted.

- Aurora MySQL–based DB clusters running Aurora Serverless v1 don't support the following:

- Invoking AWS Lambda functions from within your Aurora MySQL DB cluster. However, AWS Lambda functions can
make calls to your Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster.

- Restoring a snapshot from a DB instance that isn't Aurora MySQL or RDS for MySQL.

- Replicating data using replication based on binary logs (binlogs). This limitation is true regardless
of whether your Aurora MySQL-based DB cluster Aurora Serverless v1 is the source or the target of the
replication. To replicate data into an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster from a MySQL DB instance outside
Aurora, such as one running on Amazon EC2, consider using AWS Database Migration Service. For more information, see the
[AWS Database Migration Service User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide).

- Creating users with host-based access
( `'username'@'IP_address'`). This is
because Aurora Serverless v1 uses a router fleet between the client and the database host for seamless scaling.
The IP address that the Aurora Serverless DB cluster sees is that of the router host and not your client. For more
information, see [Aurora Serverless v1 architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v1.how-it-works.html#aurora-serverless.architecture).

Instead, use the wildcard ( `'username'@'%'`).

- Aurora PostgreSQL–based DB clusters running Aurora Serverless v1 have the following limitations:

- Aurora PostgreSQL query plan management ( `apg_plan_management` extension) isn't supported.

- The logical replication feature available in Amazon RDS PostgreSQL and Aurora PostgreSQL
isn't supported.

- Outbound communications such as those enabled by Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL extensions aren't
supported. For example, you can't access external data with the `postgres_fdw/dblink`
extension. For more information about RDS PostgreSQL extensions, see
[PostgreSQL\
on Amazon RDS](../userguide/chap-postgresql.md#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.FeatureSupport.Extensions.101x) in the _RDS User Guide_.

- Currently, certain SQL queries and commands aren't recommended. These include session-level
advisory locks, temporary relations, asynchronous notifications ( `LISTEN`), and cursors
with hold ( `DECLARE name ... CURSOR WITH HOLD FOR
                query`). Also, `NOTIFY` commands prevent scaling and
aren't recommended.

For more information, see
[Autoscaling for Aurora Serverless v1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v1.how-it-works.html#aurora-serverless.how-it-works.auto-scaling).

- You can't set the preferred automated backup window for an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster.

- You can set the maintenance window for an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster. For more information, see [Adjusting the preferred DB cluster maintenance window](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.html#AdjustingTheMaintenanceWindow.Aurora).

## Configuration requirements for Aurora Serverless v1

When you create an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster, pay attention to the following requirements:

- Use these specific port numbers for each DB engine:

- Aurora MySQL – `3306`

- Aurora PostgreSQL – `5432`

- Create your Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster in a virtual private cloud (VPC) based on the Amazon VPC service.
When you create an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster in your VPC, you consume two (2) of the fifty (50)
Interface and Gateway Load Balancer endpoints allotted to your VPC. These endpoints are created
automatically for you. To increase your quota, you can contact Support. For more information, see
[Amazon VPC\
quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html#vpc-limits-endpoints).

- You can't give an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster a public IP address. You can access an
Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster only from within a VPC.

- Create subnets in different Availability Zones for the DB subnet group that you use for your
Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster. In other words, you can't have more than one subnet in the same
Availability Zone.

- Changes to a subnet group used by an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster aren't applied to the cluster.

- You can access an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster from AWS Lambda. To do so, you must configure your Lambda
function to run in the same VPC as your Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster. For more information about working
with AWS Lambda, see [Configuring a Lambda function to access resources in\
an Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/vpc.html) in the _AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

## Using TLS/SSL with Aurora Serverless v1

By default, Aurora Serverless v1 uses the Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) protocol to
encrypt communications between clients and your Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster. It supports TLS/SSL versions
1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. You don't need to configure your Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster to use TLS/SSL.

However, the following limitations apply:

- TLS/SSL support for Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters isn't currently available in the
China (Beijing) AWS Region.

- When you create database users for an Aurora MySQL–based Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster, don't
use the `REQUIRE` clause for SSL permissions. Doing so prevents users from connecting to the
Aurora DB instance.

- For both MySQL Client and PostgreSQL Client utilities, session variables that you might use in other
environments have no effect when using TLS/SSL between client and Aurora Serverless v1.

- For the MySQL Client, when connecting with TLS/SSL's `VERIFY_IDENTITY` mode, currently you
need to use the MySQL 8.0-compatible `mysql` command. For more information, see
[Connecting to a\
DB instance running the MySQL database engine](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ConnectToInstance.html).

Depending on the client that you use to connect to Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster, you might not need to
specify TLS/SSL to get an encrypted connection. For example, to use the PostgreSQL Client to connect to an
Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster running Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition, connect as you normally do.

```nohighlight

psql -h endpoint -U user
```

After you enter your password, the PostgreSQL Client shows you see the connection details, including the
TLS/SSL version and cipher.

```nohighlight

psql (12.5 (Ubuntu 12.5-0ubuntu0.20.04.1), server 10.12)
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.
```

###### Important

Aurora Serverless v1 uses the Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) protocol to encrypt
connections by default unless SSL/TLS is disabled by the client application. The TLS/SSL connection
terminates at the router fleet. Communication between the router fleet and your Aurora Serverless v1 DB
cluster occurs within the service's internal network boundary.

You can check the status of the client connection to examine whether the connection to Aurora Serverless v1 is
TLS/SSL encrypted. The PostgreSQL `pg_stat_ssl` and `pg_stat_activity` tables and its
`ssl_is_used` function don't show the TLS/SSL state for the communication between the client
application and Aurora Serverless v1. Similarly, the TLS/SSL state can't be derived from the MySQL
`status` statement.

The Aurora cluster parameters `force_ssl` for PostgreSQL and
`require_secure_transport` for MySQL formerly weren't supported for
Aurora Serverless v1. These parameters are available now for Aurora
Serverless v1. For a complete list of parameters supported by Aurora Serverless
v1, call the [DescribeEngineDefaultClusterParameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEngineDefaultClusterParameters.html) API operation. For more information on
parameter groups and Aurora Serverless v1, see [Parameter groups for Aurora Serverless v1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v1.how-it-works.html#aurora-serverless.parameter-groups).

To use the MySQL Client to connect to an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster running Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition, you specify
TLS/SSL in your request. The following example includes the
[Amazon root CA 1 trust store](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem)
downloaded from Amazon Trust Services, which is necessary for this connection to succeed.

```nohighlight

mysql -h endpoint -P 3306 -u user -p --ssl-ca=amazon-root-CA-1.pem --ssl-mode=REQUIRED
```

When prompted, enter your password. Soon, the MySQL monitor opens. You can confirm that the session is
encrypted by using the `status` command.

```nohighlight

mysql> status
--------------
mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.62, for Linux (x86_64) using readline 5.1
Connection id:          19
Current database:
Current user:           ***@*******
SSL:                    Cipher in use is ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
...
```

To learn more about connecting to Aurora MySQL database with the MySQL Client, see
[Connecting to a DB\
instance running the MySQL database engine](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ConnectToInstance.html).

Aurora Serverless v1 supports all TLS/SSL modes available to the MySQL Client ( `mysql`) and
PostgreSQL Client ( `psql`), including those listed in the following table.

Description of TLS/SSL mode

mysql

psql

Connect without using TLS/SSL.

DISABLED

disable

Try the connection using TLS/SSL first, but fall back to non-SSL if necessary.

PREFERRED

prefer (default)

Enforce using TLS/SSL.

REQUIRED

require

Enforce TLS/SSL and verify the CA.

VERIFY\_CA

verify-ca

Enforce TLS/SSL, verify the CA, and verify the CA hostname.

VERIFY\_IDENTITY

verify-full

Aurora Serverless v1 uses wildcard certificates. If you specify the "verify CA" or the "verify CA and CA
hostname" option when using TLS/SSL, first download the
[Amazon root CA 1 trust store](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem)
from Amazon Trust Services. After doing so, you can identify this PEM-formatted file in your client command.
To do so using the PostgreSQL Client:

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

psql 'host=endpoint user=user sslmode=require sslrootcert=amazon-root-CA-1.pem dbname=db-name'
```

To learn more about working with the Aurora PostgreSQL database using the Postgres Client, see
[Connecting\
to a DB instance running the PostgreSQL database engine](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ConnectToPostgreSQLInstance.html).

For more information about connecting to Aurora DB clusters in general, see
[Connecting to an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-connecting.md).

### Supported cipher suites for connections to Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters

By using configurable cipher suites, you can have more control over the security of your
database connections. You can specify a list of cipher suites that you want to allow to
secure client TLS/SSL connections to your database. With configurable cipher suites, you can
control the connection encryption that your database server accepts. Doing this prevents the
use of ciphers that aren't secure or that are no longer used.

Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters that are based on Aurora MySQL support the same cipher
suites as Aurora MySQL provisioned DB clusters. For information about these cipher suites, see
[Configuring cipher suites for connections to Aurora MySQL DB clusters](auroramysql-security.md#AuroraMySQL.Security.SSL.ConfiguringCipherSuites).

Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters that are based on Aurora PostgreSQL don't support cipher
suites.
