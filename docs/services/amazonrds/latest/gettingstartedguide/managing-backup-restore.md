# Backing up and restoring your Amazon RDS DB instance

Data backups are important for recovering from accidental deletions, corruption, or
unexpected failures. Amazon RDS provides both automated backups and manual snapshots, so you have
flexibility in how you protect and restore your data. This section provides an overview of
these options and practical guidance for using them.

## Automated backups

Automated backups in Amazon RDS provide a reliable way to protect your data by creating
backups of your database at regular intervals and retaining them for a specified period.
Amazon RDS enables this feature by default when you create your DB instance. It ensure that you
can recover to almost any point within the retention period without manual
intervention.

These sections provide a brief overview of the available backup strategies. For
comprehensive documentation on automated backups, see [Managing automated\
backups](../userguide/user-managingautomatedbackups.md) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_.

### Retention periods

The retention period determines how long Amazon RDS retains automated backups before it
automatically deletes them. You can configure this period to meet your compliance or
operational requirements, with options ranging from 1 to 35 days.

To configure how long Amazon RDS retains automated backups, set the **Backup**
**retention period** setting for the DB instance:

![Backup settings interface with options for automated backups, retention period, and backup window.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/gettingstartedguide/images/automated-backups.png)

Consider the following when you configure a retention period:

- A longer retention period provides more recovery options but might increase
storage costs.

- RDS stores backups in Amazon S3, and AWS calculates the storage cost separately from
your DB instance usage.

For more information, see [Retaining automated backups](../userguide/user-workingwithautomatedbackups-retaining.md) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_.

### Point-in-time recovery

With point-in-time recovery, you can restore your database to any second within your
backup retention period. This is especially useful in scenarios such as accidental data
deletion or corruption.

To perform a point-in-time recovery, choose **Automated backups**
within the Amazon RDS console and select the DB instance that you want to restore. Then, choose
**Actions**, **Restore to point in time**. Specify the
exact time to which you want to restore your database. Amazon RDS creates a new instance from
the backups and leaves the original instance intact.

For more information, see [Restoring a DB instance to a specified time for Amazon RDS](../userguide/user-pit.md) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_.

## Manual snapshots

Manual snapshots provide more control over your backup strategy, and let you capture a
complete copy of your database at a specific point in time. Unlike automated backups, manual
snapshots are user-initiated and persist until you explicitly delete them. This provides a
long-term data retention option.

Manual snapshots have the following main benefits:

- Ideal for preserving data before significant schema changes or updates.

- Useful for duplicating a database in a different environment, such as development or
testing.

- Provide an additional layer of redundancy when paired with automated backups.

To take a manual snapshot, select the DB instance that you want to back up and choose
**Actions**, **Take snapshot**. RDS stores manual
snapshots in Amazon S3. You can share them across AWS accounts or copy them to different
AWS Regions for disaster recovery purposes.

![Form for taking a DB Snapshot, showing options for snapshot type and naming conventions.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/gettingstartedguide/images/take-snapshot.png)

Restoring from a manual snapshot involves creating a new DB instance from the stored
backup. Choose **Snapshots** within the Amazon RDS console and select the
snapshot that you want to restore. Choose **Actions**, **Restore**
**snapshot**. Specify the instance details for the new database.
