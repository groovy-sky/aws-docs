# Creating a Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshot for Amazon RDS

When you create a Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshot, make sure to identify which Multi-AZ DB cluster you are going to back up, and then give your DB cluster snapshot a name so you can
restore from it later. You can also share a Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshot. For instructions,
see [Sharing a DB snapshot for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ShareSnapshot.html).

You can create a Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshot using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

For very long-term backups, we recommend exporting snapshot data to Amazon S3. If the major
version of your DB engine is no longer supported, you can't restore to that version
from a snapshot. For more information, see [Exporting DB snapshot data to Amazon S3 for Amazon RDS](user-exportsnapshot.md).

###### To create a DB cluster snapshot

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

3. In the list, choose the Multi-AZ DB cluster for which you want to take a snapshot.

4. For **Actions**, choose **Take snapshot**.

The **Take DB snapshot** window appears.

5. For **Snapshot name**, enter the name of the snapshot.

6. Choose **Take snapshot**.

The **Snapshots** page appears, with the new Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshot's status shown as `Creating`. After
its status is `Available`, you can see its creation time.

You can create a Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshot by using the AWS CLI [create-db-cluster-snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster-snapshot.html) command with the following options:

- `--db-cluster-identifier`

- `--db-cluster-snapshot-identifier`

In this example, you create a Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshot called
`mymultiazdbclustersnapshot` for a DB cluster called `mymultiazdbcluster`.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster-snapshot \
    --db-cluster-identifier mymultiazdbcluster \
    --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier mymultiazdbclustersnapshot
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster-snapshot ^
    --db-cluster-identifier mymultiazdbcluster ^
    --db-cluster snapshot-identifier mymultiazdbclustersnapshot
```

You can create a Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshot by using the Amazon RDS API
[CreateDBClusterSnapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDBClusterSnapshot.html) operation with the following
parameters:

- `DBClusterIdentifier`

- `DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier`

## Deleting a Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshot

You can delete Multi-AZ DB snapshots managed by Amazon RDS when you no longer need them. For
instructions, see [Deleting a DB snapshot for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_DeleteSnapshot.html).
