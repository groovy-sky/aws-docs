# Viewing the enrollment of your DB instances or Multi-AZ DB clusters in Amazon RDS Extended Support

You can view the enrollment of your DB instances or
Multi-AZ DB clusters in
RDS Extended Support using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

###### Note

The **RDS Extended Support** column in the console, the
 - `-engine-lifecycle-support` option in the AWS CLI, and the
`EngineLifecycleSupport` parameter in the RDS API only indicate
enrollment in RDS Extended Support. Charges for RDS Extended Support only start when your DB engine version
has reached the RDS end of standard support. For more information, see [Major versions](mysql-concepts-versionmgmt.md#MySQL.Concepts.VersionMgmt.ReleaseCalendar) and [Release calendar for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](../postgresqlreleasenotes/postgresql-release-calendar.md) in the _Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL_
_Release Notes_.

For example, you have an RDS for MySQL 5.7 database that is enrolled in RDS Extended Support. On
March 1, 2024, Amazon RDS started charging you for RDS Extended Support for this database. On July 31,
2024, you upgraded this database to RDS for MySQL 8.0. The RDS Extended Support status for this
database remains enabled. However, the RDS Extended Support charges for this database stopped
because RDS for MySQL 8.0 hadn't reached RDS end of standard support yet. Amazon RDS won't
charge you for RDS Extended Support for this database until August 1, 2026, which is when RDS
standard support ends for RDS for MySQL 8.0.

###### To view the enrollment of your DB instances or Multi-AZ DB clusters in RDS Extended Support

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**. The value
    under **RDS Extended Support** indicates if
    a DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster is enrolled in
    RDS Extended Support. If no value appears, then RDS Extended Support isn't available for your
    database.

###### Tip

If the **RDS Extended Support** column doesn't
appear, choose the **Preferences** icon, and then turn
on **RDS Extended Support**.

3. You can also view the enrollment on the **Configuration**
    tab for each database. Choose a database under **DB**
**identifier**. On the **Configuration** tab,
    look under **Extended Support** to see if the database is enrolled or
    not.

To view the enrollment of your databases in RDS Extended Support by using the AWS CLI, run the
[describe-db-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.html) or [describe-db-clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-clusters.html) (Multi-AZ DB clusters) command.

If RDS Extended Support is available for a database, then the response includes the
parameter `EngineLifecycleSupport`. The value
`open-source-rds-extended-support` indicates that a DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster is enrolled in RDS Extended Support. The value
`open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled` indicates that enrollment
of the DB instance or Multi-AZ DB
cluster in
RDS Extended Support was disabled.

**Example**

The following command returns information for all of your DB
instances:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances
```

The following response shows that a PostgreSQL engine
running on the DB instance `database-1` is enrolled in RDS Extended Support:

```nohighlight

{
    "DBInstanceIdentifier": "database-1",
    "DBInstanceClass": "db.t3.large",
    "Engine": "postgres",
    ...
    "EngineLifecycleSupport": "open-source-rds-extended-support"
}
```

To view the enrollment of your databases in RDS Extended Support by using the Amazon RDS API, use
the [DescribeDBInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBInstances.html) or [DescribeDBClusters](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbclusters.md) operation.

If RDS Extended Support is available for a database, then the response includes the
parameter `EngineLifecycleSupport`. The value
`open-source-rds-extended-support` indicates that a DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster is enrolled in
RDS Extended Support. The value `open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled`
indicates that enrollment of the DB instance or
Multi-AZ DB cluster in RDS Extended Support was disabled.
