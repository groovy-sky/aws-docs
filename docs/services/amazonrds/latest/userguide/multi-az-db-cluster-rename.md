# Renaming a Multi-AZ DB cluster for Amazon RDS

You can rename a Multi-AZ DB cluster by using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI
`modify-db-cluster` command, or the Amazon RDS API `ModifyDBCluster`
operation. Renaming a Multi-AZ DB cluster can have significant effects. The following is a
list of considerations before you rename a Multi-AZ DB cluster.

- When you rename a Multi-AZ DB cluster, the cluster endpoints for the Multi-AZ DB cluster
change. These endpoints change because they include the name you assigned to the
Multi-AZ DB cluster. You can redirect traffic from an old endpoint to a new one. For
more information about Multi-AZ DB cluster endpoints, see [Connecting to a Multi-AZ DB cluster for Amazon RDS](multi-az-db-clusters-concepts-connection-management.md).

- When you rename a Multi-AZ DB cluster, the old DNS name that was used by the Multi-AZ DB cluster
is deleted, although it could remain cached for a few minutes. The new DNS name for the renamed
Multi-AZ DB cluster becomes effective in about two minutes. The renamed Multi-AZ DB cluster isn't
available until the new name becomes effective.

- You can't use an existing Multi-AZ DB cluster name when renaming a cluster.

- Metrics and events associated with the name of a Multi-AZ DB cluster are maintained if you reuse a DB
cluster name.

- Multi-AZ DB cluster tags remain with the Multi-AZ DB cluster, regardless of
renaming.

- DB cluster snapshots are retained for a renamed Multi-AZ DB cluster.

###### Note

A Multi-AZ DB cluster is an isolated database environment running in the cloud. A Multi-AZ DB cluster can
host multiple databases. For information about changing a database name, see the documentation
for your DB engine.

## Renaming to replace an existing Multi-AZ DB cluster

The most common scenarios for renaming a Multi-AZ DB cluster include restoring data from a
DB cluster snapshot or performing point-in-time recovery (PITR). By renaming the
Multi-AZ DB cluster, you can replace the Multi-AZ DB cluster without changing any
application code that references the Multi-AZ DB cluster. In these cases, complete the
following steps:

1. Stop all traffic going to the Multi-AZ DB cluster. You can redirect traffic from accessing
    the databases on the Multi-AZ DB cluster, or choose another way to prevent
    traffic from accessing your databases on the Multi-AZ DB cluster.

2. Rename the existing Multi-AZ DB cluster.

3. Create a new Multi-AZ DB cluster by restoring from a DB cluster snapshot or recovering to
    a point in time. Then, give the new Multi-AZ DB cluster the name of the previous
    Multi-AZ DB cluster.

If you delete the old Multi-AZ DB cluster, you are responsible for deleting any unwanted DB
cluster snapshots of the old Multi-AZ DB cluster.

###### To rename a Multi-AZ DB cluster

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

3. Choose the Multi-AZ DB cluster that you want to rename.

4. Choose **Modify**.

5. In **Settings**, enter a new name for **DB cluster**
**identifier**.

6. Choose **Continue**.

7. To apply the changes immediately, choose **Apply immediately**. Choosing
    this option can cause an outage in some cases. For more information, see
    [Applying changes immediately](modify-multi-az-db-cluster.md#modify-multi-az-db-cluster-apply-immediately).

8. On the confirmation page, review your changes. If they are correct, choose
    **Modify cluster** to save your changes.

Alternatively, choose **Back** to edit your changes, or choose
    **Cancel** to discard your changes.

To rename a Multi-AZ DB cluster, use the AWS CLI command [modify-db-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster.html).
Provide the current `--db-cluster-identifier` value and
`--new-db-cluster-identifier` parameter with the new name of the
Multi-AZ DB cluster.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster \
    --db-cluster-identifier DBClusterIdentifier \
    --new-db-cluster-identifier NewDBClusterIdentifier
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster ^
    --db-cluster-identifier DBClusterIdentifier ^
    --new-db-cluster-identifier NewDBClusterIdentifier
```

To rename a Multi-AZ DB cluster, call the Amazon RDS API operation [ModifyDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbcluster.md) with the
following parameters:

- `DBClusterIdentifier` – The existing name of the DB cluster.

- `NewDBClusterIdentifier` – The new name of the DB cluster.
