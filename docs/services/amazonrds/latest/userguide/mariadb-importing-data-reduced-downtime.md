# Importing data to an Amazon RDS for MariaDB DB instance with reduced downtime

In some cases, you might need to import data from an external MariaDB database that
supports a live application to an RDS for MariaDB DB instance. Use the following procedure to minimize the impact on availability of
applications. This procedure can also help if you are working with a very large database.
Using this procedure, you can reduce the cost of the import by reducing the amount of data
that is passed across the network to AWS.

In this procedure, you transfer a copy of your database data to an Amazon EC2 instance and
import the data into a new Amazon RDS database. You then use replication to bring the Amazon RDS
database up-to-date with your live external instance, before redirecting your application to
the Amazon RDS database. If the external instance is MariaDB 10.0.24 or higher and the target
instance is RDS for MariaDB, configure MariaDB replication based on global transaction
identifiers (GTIDs). Otherwise, configure replication based on binary log coordinates. We
recommend GTID-based replication if your external database supports it because GTID-based
replication is a more reliable method. For more information, see [Global transaction\
ID](http://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/global-transaction-id) in the MariaDB documentation.

The following diagram shows importing an external MariaDB database into a MariaDB database
on Amazon RDS.

![Workflow that shows importing an external MariaDB database into a MariaDB database on Amazon RDS.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/MigrateMariaDBToRDS_1.png)

## Task 1: Create a copy of your existing database

The first step in the process of migrating a large amount of data to an RDS for MariaDB
database with minimal downtime is to create a copy of the source data.

The following diagram shows creating a backup of the MariaDB database.

![Workflow that shows creating a backup of the MariaDB database.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/MigrateMariaDBToRDS_2.png)

You can use the `mysqldump` or `mariadb-dump` utility to create
a database backup in either SQL or delimited-text format. In MariaDB 10.5, the client is
called [mariadb-dump](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-dump).
Starting with MariaDB 11.0.1, you must use `mariadb-dump` instead of
`mysqldump`. We recommend that you do a test run with each format in a
non-production environment to see which method minimizes the amount of time that
`mysqldump` or `mariadb-dump` runs.

We also recommend that you weigh `mysqldump` or `mariadb-dump`
performance against the benefit offered by using the delimited-text format for loading.
A backup using delimited-text format creates a tab-separated text file for each table
being dumped. To reduce the amount of time required to import your database, you can
load these files in parallel using the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` command. For
more information, see [Step 5: Load the data](mariadb-importing-data-any-source.md#mariadb-importing-data-any-source-load-data) in the Importing data
from any source procedure.

Before you start the backup operation, make sure to set the replication options on the
MariaDB database that you are copying to Amazon RDS. The replication options include turning
on binary logging and setting a unique server ID. Setting these options causes your
server to start logging database transactions and prepares it to be a source replication
instance later in this process.

Make sure that you're aware of the following recommendations and
considerations:

- Use the `--single-transaction` option with `mysqldump`
or `mariadb-dump` because it dumps a consistent state of the
database. To ensure a valid dump file, don't run data definition language
(DDL) statements while `mysqldump` or `mariadb-dump` is
running. You can schedule a maintenance window for these operations.

- Exclude the following schemas from the dump file:

- `sys`

- `performance_schema`

- `information_schema`

The `mysqldump` and `mariadb-dump` utilities exclude
these schemas by default.

- If you need to migrate users and privileges, consider using a tool that
generates the data control language (DCL) for recreating them, such as the
[pt-show-grants](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/LATEST/pt-show-grants.html) utility.

### To set replication options

1. Edit the `my.cnf` file. This file is usually located under
    `/etc`.

```bash

sudo vi /etc/my.cnf
```

Add the `log_bin` and `server_id` options to the
    `[mysqld]` section. The `log_bin` option provides
    a file name identifier for binary log files. The `server_id`
    option provides a unique identifier for the server in source-replica
    relationships.

The following example shows the updated `[mariadb]` section of
    a `my.cnf` file:

```nohighlight

[mariadb]
log-bin
server-id=1
log-basename=master1
binlog-format=mixed
```

For more information, see [Setting the Replication Source Configuration](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/ha-and-performance/standard-replication/setting-up-replication) in the MariaDB
    documentation.

2. For replication with a Multi-AZ DB cluster, enable `gtid_strict_mode`. For
    more information, see [gtid\_strict\_mode](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/ha-and-performance/standard-replication/gtid) in the MariaDB documentation.

Enabling `gtid_strict_mode` isn't required for replication with
    a DB instance.

3. Restart the `mariadb` service.

```bash

sudo service mariadb restart
```

### To create a backup copy of your existing database

1. Create a backup of your data using the `mysqldump` or
    `mariadb-dump` utility, specifying either SQL or
    delimited-text format.

To improve performance and ensure data integrity, use the
    `--order-by-primary` and `--single-transaction`
    options for `mysqldump` and `mariadb-dump`.

To
    avoid including the MySQL system database in the backup, don't use the
    `--all-databases` option with `mysqldump` or
    `mariadb-dump`. For more information, see [Creating a Data Snapshot Using mysqldump](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-replication-excerpt/8.0/en/replication-howto-mysqldump.html) in the MySQL
    documentation.

Use `chmod`, if necessary, to make sure that the directory
    where the backup file is being created is writeable.

###### Important

On Windows, run the command window as an administrator.

- To produce SQL output, use the
following command. For MariaDB 10.11 versions and lower, replace
`mariadb-dump` with `mysqldump`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

sudo mariadb-dump \
      --databases database_name \
      --master-data=2  \
      --single-transaction \
      --order-by-primary \
      -r backup.sql \
      -u local_user \
      -ppassword
```

###### Note

As a security best practice, specify credentials other than
the prompts shown in the example.

For Windows:

```nohighlight

mariadb-dump ^
      --databases database_name ^
      --master-data=2  ^
      --single-transaction ^
      --order-by-primary ^
      -r backup.sql ^
      -u local_user ^
      -ppassword
```

###### Note

As a security best practice, specify credentials other than
the prompts shown in the example.

- To produce delimited-text output, use the following command. For
MariaDB 11.01 and higher versions, replace `mysqldump`
with `mariadb-dump`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

sudo mysqldump \
      --tab=target_directory \
      --fields-terminated-by ',' \
      --fields-enclosed-by '"' \
      --lines-terminated-by 0x0d0a \
      database_name \
      --master-data=2 \
      --single-transaction \
      --order-by-primary \
      -ppassword
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

mysqldump ^
      --tab=target_directory ^
      --fields-terminated-by "," ^
      --fields-enclosed-by """ ^
      --lines-terminated-by 0x0d0a ^
      database_name ^
      --master-data=2 ^
      --single-transaction ^
      --order-by-primary ^
      -ppassword
```

###### Note

As a security best practice, specify credentials other than
the prompts shown in the example.

Make sure to create any stored procedures, triggers,
functions, or events manually in your Amazon RDS database. If you
have any of these objects in the database that you are copying,
then exclude them when you run `mysqldump` or
`mariadb-dump`. To do so, include the following
arguments with your `mysqldump` or
`mariadb-dump` command:

- `--routines=0`

- `--triggers=0`

- `--events=0`

When you run `mysqldump` and specify the delimited-text
format, a `CHANGE MASTER TO` comment is returned. This
comment contains the master log file name and position. If the external instance is a MariaDB 10.0.23 or lower
version, note the values for `MASTER_LOG_FILE` and
`MASTER_LOG_POS`. You need these values when setting
up replication.

The following output is returned for MariaDB versions.

```nohighlight

-- Position to start replication or point-in-time recovery from
--
-- CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin-changelog.000031', MASTER_LOG_POS=107;
```

2. If the external instance you are using is MariaDB version 10.0.24 or
    higher, use GTID-based replication. Run `SHOW MASTER STATUS` on
    the external MariaDB instance to get the binary log file name and position,
    and then convert them to a GTID by running `BINLOG_GTID_POS` on
    the external MariaDB instance.

```sql

SELECT BINLOG_GTID_POS('binary_log_file_name', binary_log_file_position);
```

Note the GTID returned. You need the GTID to configure replication.

3. Compress the copied data to reduce the amount of network resources needed
    to copy your data to the Amazon RDS database. Note the size of the backup file.
    You need this information when determining how large an Amazon EC2 instance to
    create. When you are done, compress the backup file using GZIP or your
    preferred compression utility.

- To compress SQL output, use the following command:

```bash

gzip backup.sql
```

- To compress delimited-text output, use the following
command:

```bash

tar -zcvf backup.tar.gz target_directory
```

## Task 2: Create an Amazon EC2 instance and copy the compressed database

Copying your compressed database backup file to an Amazon EC2 instance takes fewer network
resources than doing a direct copy of uncompressed data between database instances.
After your data is in Amazon EC2, you can copy it from there directly to your MariaDB
database. For you to save on the cost of network resources, your Amazon EC2 instance must be
in the same AWS Region as your Amazon RDS DB instance. Having the Amazon EC2 instance in the
same AWS Region as your Amazon RDS database also reduces network latency during the
import.

The following diagram shows copying the database backup to an Amazon EC2 instance.

![Workflow that shows copying the database backup to an Amazon EC2 instance.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/MigrateMariaDBToRDS_3.png)

### To create an Amazon EC2 instance and copy your data

1. In the AWS Region where you plan to create the Amazon RDS database, create a
    virtual private cloud (VPC), a VPC security group, and a VPC subnet. Ensure
    that the inbound rules for your VPC security group allow the IP addresses
    required for your application to connect to AWS. You can specify a range
    of IP addresses—for example, `203.0.113.0/24`—or
    another VPC security group. You can use the [Amazon VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc) to create and manage VPCs, subnets, and security
    groups. For more information, see [Getting started with Amazon VPC](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.md#getting-started) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User_
_Guide_.

2. Open the [Amazon EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2) and choose
    the AWS Region to contain both your Amazon EC2 instance and your Amazon RDS
    database. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance using the VPC, subnet, and security group
    that you created in Step 1. Ensure that you select an instance type with
    enough storage for your database backup file when it is uncompressed. For
    details on Amazon EC2 instances, see [Getting started with\
    Amazon EC2](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-getstarted.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User_
_Guide_.

3. To connect to your Amazon RDS database from your Amazon EC2 instance, edit your VPC
    security group. Add an inbound rule specifying the private IP address of
    your EC2 instance. You can find the private IP address on the
    **Details** tab of the **Instance**
    pane in the EC2 console window. To edit the VPC security group and add an
    inbound rule, choose **Security Groups** in the EC2 console
    navigation pane, choose your security group, and then add an inbound rule
    for MySQL or Aurora specifying the private IP address of your EC2 instance.
    To learn how to add an inbound rule to a VPC security group, see [Security group\
    rules](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/security-group-rules.md) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.

4. Copy your compressed database backup file from your local system to your
    Amazon EC2 instance. Use `chmod`, if necessary, to make sure that you
    have write permission for the target directory of the Amazon EC2 instance. You
    can use `scp` or a Secure Shell (SSH) client to copy the file.
    The following command is an example `scp` command:

```bash

scp -r -i key pair.pem backup.sql.gz ec2-user@EC2 DNS:/target_directory/backup.sql.gz
```

###### Important

When copying sensitive data, be sure to use a secure network transfer
protocol.

5. Connect to your Amazon EC2 instance and install the latest updates
    and the MariaDB client tools using the following commands:

```bash

sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install mariadb1011-client-utils -y
```

For more information, see [Connect to your instance](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-getstarted.md#ec2-connect-to-instance-linux) for Linux instances in the
    _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ and [MariaDB Connectors](https://mariadb.com/docs/connectors) in
    the MariaDB documentation.

6. While connected to your Amazon EC2 instance, decompress your database backup
    file. The following commands are examples.

- To decompress SQL output, use the following command:

```bash

gzip backup.sql.gz -d
```

- To decompress delimited-text output, use the following
command:

```bash

tar xzvf backup.tar.gz
```

## Task 3: Create a MariaDB database and import data from your Amazon EC2 instance

By creating an RDS for MariaDB DB instance in the same AWS Region as your Amazon EC2 instance,
you can import the database backup file from Amazon EC2 faster than over the internet.

The following diagram shows importing the backup from an Amazon EC2 instance into a MariaDB
database.

![Workflow that shows importing the backup from the EC2 instance into the MariaDB database.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/MigrateMariaDBToRDS_4.png)

### To create a MariaDB database and import your data

1. Determine which DB instance class and what amount of storage space is
    required to support the expected workload for this Amazon RDS database. As part
    of this process, decide what is sufficient space and processing capacity for
    your data load procedures. Also, decide what is required to handle the
    production workload. You can estimate this based on the size and resources
    of the source MariaDB database. For more information, see [DB instance classes](concepts-dbinstanceclass.md).

2. Create a DB instance in the AWS Region that contains your Amazon EC2
    instance. Follow the instructions in [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md) and use the following
    guidelines:

- Specify a DB engine version that is compatible with your source DB
instance.

- Specify the same virtual private cloud (VPC) and VPC security
group as for your Amazon EC2 instance. This approach ensures that your
Amazon EC2 instance and your Amazon RDS instance are visible to each other
over the network. Make sure your DB instance is publicly accessible.
To set up replication with your source database as described in a
following section, your DB instance must be publicly
accessible.

- Don't configure multiple Availability Zones, backup retention, or
read replicas until after you have imported the database backup.
When that import is completed, you can configure Multi-AZ and backup
retention for the production instance.

3. Review the default configuration options for the Amazon RDS database. If the
    default parameter group for the database doesn't have the configuration
    options that you want, find a different one that does or create a new
    parameter group. For more information about creating a parameter group, see
    [Parameter groups for Amazon RDS](user-workingwithparamgroups.md).

4. Connect to the new Amazon RDS database as the master user. Create the users
    required to support the administrators, applications, and services that need
    to access the DB instance. The hostname for the Amazon RDS database is the
    **Endpoint** value for this DB instance without the
    port number, for example,
    `mysampledb.123456789012.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com`. You can find
    the endpoint value in the database details in the Amazon RDS console.

5. Connect to your Amazon EC2 instance. For more information, see [Connect to your instance](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-getstarted.md#ec2-connect-to-instance-linux) for Linux instances in the
    _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.

6. Connect to your Amazon RDS database as a remote host from your Amazon EC2 instance
    using the `mysql` command. The following command is an
    example:

```nohighlight

mysql -h host_name -P 3306 -u db_master_user -p
```

The `host_name` is the Amazon RDS database
    endpoint.

7. At the `mysql` prompt, run the `source` command and
    pass it the name of your database dump file. This command loads the data
    into the Amazon RDS DB instance.

- For SQL format, use the following command:

```nohighlight

MariaDB [(none)]> source backup.sql;
```

- For delimited-text format, first create the database, if it isn't
the default database that you created when setting up the Amazon RDS
database.

```sql

MariaDB [(none)]> create database database_name;
MariaDB [(none)]> use database_name;
```

Then create the tables.

```sql

MariaDB [(none)]> source table1.sql
MariaDB [(none)]> source table2.sql
etc...
```

Then import the data.

```sql

MariaDB [(none)]> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'table1.txt' INTO TABLE table1 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '0x0d0a';
MariaDB [(none)]> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'table2.txt' INTO TABLE table2 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '0x0d0a';
etc...
```

To improve performance, you can perform these operations in
parallel from multiple connections so that all of your tables are
created and then loaded at the same time.

###### Note

If you used any data-formatting options with
`mysqldump` or `mariadb-dump` when you
initially dumped the table, make sure to use the same options
with `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` to ensure proper
interpretation of the data file contents.

8. Run a simple `SELECT` query against one or two of the tables in
    the imported database to verify that the import was successful.

If you no longer need the Amazon EC2 instance used in this procedure, terminate the EC2
instance to reduce your AWS resource usage. To terminate an EC2 instance, see
[Terminate an instance](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/terminating-instances.md#terminating-instances-console) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User_
_Guide_.

## Task 4: Replicate data from your external database to your new Amazon RDS database

Your source database was likely updated during the time that it took to copy and
transfer the data to the MariaDB database. You can use replication to bring the copied
database up-to-date with the source database.

![Workflow that shows replicating data from the external MariaDB database to the database on Amazon RDS.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/MigrateMariaDBToRDS_5.png)

The permissions required to start replication on an Amazon RDS database are restricted and
aren't available to your Amazon RDS master user. Because of this, use the appropriate Amazon RDS
stored procedure:

- [mysql.rds\_set\_external\_master](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_set_external_master)

- [mysql.rds\_set\_external\_master\_gtid](mysql-rds-set-external-master-gtid.md) to configure
replication and [mysql.rds\_start\_replication](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_start_replication) to start replication

### To start replication

In Task 1, [when\
you set replication options](#mariadb-importing-data-reduced-downtime-set-replication-options), you turned on binary logging and set a
unique server ID for your source database. Now, you can set up your Amazon RDS database
as a replica with your live database as the source replication instance.

1. In the Amazon RDS console, add the IP address of the server that hosts the
    source database to the VPC security group for the Amazon RDS database. For more
    information on configuring a VPC security group, see [Configure security group rules](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/working-with-security-group-rules.md) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User_
_Guide_.

You might also need to configure your local network to permit connections
    from the IP address of your Amazon RDS database so that it can communicate with
    your source instance. To find the IP address of the Amazon RDS database, use the
    `host` command:

```nohighlight

host host_name
```

The `host_name` is the DNS name from the Amazon RDS
    database endpoint, for example
    `myinstance.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`. You
    can find the endpoint value in the DB instance details in the Amazon RDS
    console.

2. Using the client of your choice, connect to the source instance and create
    a user to be used for replication. This account is used solely for
    replication and must be restricted to your domain to improve security. The
    following command is an example:

```sql

CREATE USER 'repl_user'@'mydomain.com' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

###### Note

Specify credentials other than the prompts shown here as a security
best practice.

3. For the source instance, grant `REPLICATION CLIENT` and
    `REPLICATION SLAVE` privileges to your replication user. For
    example, to grant the `REPLICATION CLIENT` and `REPLICATION
                               SLAVE` privileges on all databases for the
    ' `repl_user`' user for your domain, issue the following
    command:

```sql

GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT, REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repl_user'@'mydomain.com';
```

4. If you used SQL format to create your backup file and the external
    instance isn't MariaDB 10.0.24 or higher, look at the contents of that file
    by running the following command:

```bash

cat backup.sql
```

The file includes a `CHANGE MASTER TO` comment that contains
    the master log file name and position. This comment is included in the
    backup file when you use the `--master-data` option with
    `mysqldump`. Note the values for `MASTER_LOG_FILE`
    and `MASTER_LOG_POS`.

```nohighlight

   --
   -- Position to start replication or point-in-time recovery from
   --

   -- CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin-changelog.000031', MASTER_LOG_POS=107;
```

If you used delimited text format to create your backup file and the
    external instance isn't MariaDB 10.0.24 or higher, you should already have
    binary log coordinates from Step 1 in Task 1 [when you\
    created a backup copy of your existing database](#mariadb-importing-data-reduced-downtime-create-backup).

If the external instance is MariaDB 10.0.24 or higher, you should already
    have the GTID from which to start replication from Step 2 in Task 1 [when you\
    created a backup copy of your existing database](#mariadb-importing-data-reduced-downtime-create-backup).

5. Make the Amazon RDS database the replica. If the external instance isn't
    MariaDB 10.0.24 or higher, connect to the Amazon RDS database as the master user
    and identify the source database as the source replication instance by using
    the [mysql.rds\_set\_external\_master](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_set_external_master) stored
    procedure.

If you have a SQL format backup file, use the master log file name and
    master log position that you determined in Step 4. If you used
    delimited-text format, use the name and position that you determined when
    creating the backup files. The following command is an example:

```sql

CALL mysql.rds_set_external_master ('myserver.mydomain.com', 3306,
       'repl_user', 'password', 'mysql-bin-changelog.000031', 107, 1);
```

###### Note

Specify credentials other than the prompts shown here as a security
best practice.

If the external instance is MariaDB 10.0.24 or higher, connect to the
    Amazon RDS database as the master user and identify the source database as the
    source replication instance by using the [mysql.rds\_set\_external\_master\_gtid](mysql-rds-set-external-master-gtid.md) stored procedure.
    Use the GTID that you determined in Step 2 in Task 1 [when you\
    created a backup copy of your existing database](#mariadb-importing-data-reduced-downtime-create-backup). The following
    command is an example:

```sql

CALL mysql.rds_set_external_master_gtid ('source_server_ip_address', 3306, 'ReplicationUser', 'password', 'GTID', 1);
```

The `source_server_ip_address` is
    the IP address of source replication instance. An EC2 private DNS address
    isn't currently supported.

###### Note

Specify credentials other than the prompts shown here as a security
best practice.

6. On the Amazon RDS database, to start replication, run the following command
    that uses the [mysql.rds\_start\_replication](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_start_replication) stored procedure:

```sql

CALL mysql.rds_start_replication;
```

7. On the Amazon RDS database, to determine when the replica is up-to-date with
    the source replication instance, run the [SHOW REPLICA STATUS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-replica-status.html) command. The results of the `SHOW
                               REPLICA STATUS` command include the
    `Seconds_Behind_Master` field. When the
    `Seconds_Behind_Master` field returns 0, then the replica is
    up-to-date with the source replication instance.

For a MariaDB 10.5, 10.6, 10.11, 11.4, or 11.8 DB instance, use the [mysql.rds\_replica\_status](mysql-rds-replica-status.md) stored procedure instead of
    running the MySQL command.

8. After the Amazon RDS database is up-to-date, turn on automated backups so you
    can restore that database if needed. You can turn on or modify automated
    backups for your Amazon RDS database by using the [Amazon RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds). For more information, see [Introduction to backups](user-workingwithautomatedbackups.md).

## Task 5: Redirect your live application to your Amazon RDS instance

After the MariaDB database is up-to-date with the source replication instance, you can
now update your live application to use the Amazon RDS instance.

![Workflow that shows stopping replication and directing the live application to the database on Amazon RDS.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/MigrateMariaDBToRDS_6.png)

### To redirect your live application to your MariaDB database and stop replication

1. To add the VPC security group for the Amazon RDS database, add the IP address
    of the server that hosts the application. For more information on modifying
    a VPC security group, see [Configure security group rules](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/working-with-security-group-rules.md) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User_
_Guide_.

2. Verify that the `Seconds_Behind_Master` field in the [SHOW REPLICA STATUS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-replica-status.html) command results is 0, which indicates that
    the replica is up-to-date with the source replication instance.

```sql

SHOW REPLICA STATUS;
```

For a MariaDB 10.5, 10.6, 10.11, 11.4, or 11.8 DB instance, use the [mysql.rds\_replica\_status](mysql-rds-replica-status.md) procedure instead of running
    the MySQL command.

3. Close all connections to the source when their transactions
    complete.

4. Update your application to use the Amazon RDS database. This update typically
    involves changing the connection settings to identify the hostname and port
    of the Amazon RDS database, the user account and password to connect with, and
    the database to use.

5. Connect to the DB instance.

6. Stop replication for the Amazon RDS instance by running the following command
    that uses the [mysql.rds\_stop\_replication](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_stop_replication) stored procedure:

```sql

CALL mysql.rds_stop_replication;
```

7. Reset the replication configuration so this instance is no longer
    identified as a replica by running the following command that uses the [mysql.rds\_reset\_external\_master](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_reset_external_master) stored procedure
    on your Amazon RDS database:

```sql

CALL mysql.rds_reset_external_master;
```

8. Turn on additional Amazon RDS features such as Multi-AZ support and read
    replicas. For more information, see [Configuring and managing a Multi-AZ deployment for Amazon RDS](concepts-multiaz.md) and [Working with DB instance read replicas](user-readrepl.md).
