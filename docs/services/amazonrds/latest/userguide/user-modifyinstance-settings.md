# Settings for DB instances

In the following table, you can find details about which settings you can and can't
modify. You can also find when changes can be applied and whether the changes cause
downtime for your DB instance. By using Amazon RDS features such as Multi-AZ, you can
minimize downtime if you later modify the DB instance. For more information, see [Configuring and managing a Multi-AZ deployment for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html).

You can modify a DB instance using the console, the [`modify-db-instance`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html) CLI command, or the [`ModifyDBInstance`](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbinstance.md) RDS API operation.

**Allocated storage**

The storage, in gibibytes, that you want to allocate for your DB
instance. You can only increase the allocated storage. You
can't reduce the allocated storage.

You can't modify the storage of some older DB instances, or
DB instances restored from older DB snapshots. The
**Allocated storage** setting is disabled in
the console if your DB instance isn't eligible. You can check
whether you can allocate more storage by using the CLI command
[describe-valid-db-instance-modifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-valid-db-instance-modifications.html). This command
returns the valid storage options for your DB instance.

You can't modify allocated storage if the DB instance status
is **storage-optimization**. You also can't modify
allocated storage for a DB instance if it's been modified in the
last six hours.

The maximum storage allowed depends on your DB engine and the
storage type. For more information, see [Amazon RDS DB instance storage](chap-storage.md).

**CLI option:**

`--allocated-storage`

**RDS API parameter:**

`AllocatedStorage`

If you choose to apply the change immediately, it occurs
immediately.

If you don't choose to apply the change immediately, it
occurs during the next maintenance window.

Downtime doesn't occur during this change. Performance might
be degraded during the change.

All DB engines

**Architecture configuration**

A configuration that allows multiple tenant databases to reside in
your DB instance. Currently, only RDS for Oracle container databases (CDBs)
support this setting.

If your CDB is in the single-tenant configuration, you can modify
it to use the **Multi-tenant configuration**. In
this configuration, you can use RDS APIs to create 1–30 tenant databases, depending on the database edition and any required option licenses. Application PDBs and
proxy PDBs aren't supported. The multi-tenant configuration is
permanent, which means that you can't later convert your CDB back to
the single-tenant configuration.

###### Note

The Amazon RDS configuration is called "multi-tenant" rather than "multitenant" because it is a
capability of Amazon RDS, not just the Oracle DB engine. Similarly, the RDS term "tenant"
refers to any tenant in an RDS configuration, not just Oracle PDBs. In the RDS documentation,
the unhyphenated term "Oracle multitenant" refers exclusively to the Oracle database CDB
architecture, which is compatible with both on-premises and RDS deployments.

For more information, see [Overview of RDS for Oracle CDBs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Oracle.Concepts.CDBs.html).

**CLI option:**

`--multi-tenant` (multi-tenant configuration of the CDB
architecture)

`--no-multi-tenant` (single-tenant configuration of the
CDB architecture)

**API parameter:**

`MultiTenant`

The change occurs immediately.

Downtime doesn't occur during this change.

Oracle

**Architecture settings**

The architecture of the Oracle database: CDB or non-CDB. If you
choose **Oracle multitenant architecture**,
RDS for Oracle converts your non-CDB into a CDB that uses the
single-tenant configuration.

This setting is supported only if your database is a non-CDB
running Oracle Database 19c with the April 2021 or higher RU. After
conversion, your CDB contains one initial pluggable database (PDB).
The architecture change is permanent, which means that you can't
convert your CDB back to a non-CDB.

###### Note

To convert a CDB in the single-tenant configuration to the
multi-tenant configuration, modify your CDB instance again and
choose **Multi-tenant configuration** for your
**Architecture configuration**.

For more information, see [Single-tenant configuration of the CDB architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Oracle.Concepts.CDBs.html#Oracle.Concepts.single-tenant).

**CLI option:**

`--engine oracle-ee-cdb` (Oracle multitenant)

`--engine oracle-se2-cdb` (Oracle multitenant)

**API parameter:**

`Engine`

If you choose to apply the change immediately, it occurs
immediately.

If you don't choose to apply the change immediately, it
occurs during the next maintenance window.

Downtime occurs during this change.
