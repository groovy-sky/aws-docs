# PostgreSQL version numbers

The version numbering sequence for the PostgreSQL database engine is as
follows:

- For PostgreSQL versions 10 and higher, the engine version
number is in the form _major.minor_. The
major version number is the integer part of the version
number. The minor version number is the fractional part of
the version number.

A major version upgrade increases the integer part of the
version number, such as upgrading from
10. _minor_ to
11. _minor_.

- For PostgreSQL versions lower than 10, the engine version
number is in the form
_major.major.minor_. The major engine
version number is both the integer and the first fractional
part of the version number. For example, 9.6 is a major
version. The minor version number is the third part of the
version number. For example, for version 9.6.12, the 12 is
the minor version number.

A major version upgrade increases the major part of the
version number. For example, an upgrade from
_9.6_.12 to 11.14 is a major
version upgrade, where _9.6_ and
_11_ are the major version
numbers.
