# Internetwork traffic privacy

Connections are protected both between Amazon RDS
and on-premises
applications and between Amazon RDS
and other AWS resources within the same
AWS Region.

## Traffic between service and on-premises clients and applications

You have two connectivity options between your private network and AWS:

- An AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. For more information, see [What is\
AWS Site-to-Site VPN?](../../../vpn/latest/s2svpn/vpc-vpn.md)

- An Direct Connect connection. For more information, see [What is Direct Connect?](../../../directconnect/latest/userguide/welcome.md)

You get access to Amazon RDS
through the network by using
AWS-published API operations. Clients must support the following:

- Transport Layer Security (TLS). We require TLS 1.2 and recommend TLS
1.3.

- Cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as DHE
(Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman) or ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Ephemeral
Diffie-Hellman). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support
these modes.

Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret
access key that is associated with an IAM principal. Or you can use the [AWS Security Token Service](../../../../reference/sts/latest/apireference/welcome.md) (AWS STS) to generate temporary security credentials to
sign requests.
