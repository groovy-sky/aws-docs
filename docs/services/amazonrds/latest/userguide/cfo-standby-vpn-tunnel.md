# Configuring a VPN tunnel between RDS Custom for Oracle primary and replica instances

###### Note

End of support notice: On March 31, 2027, AWS will end support for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. After March 31, 2027, you will no longer be able to access the RDS Custom for Oracle console or RDS Custom for Oracle resources. For more information, see [RDS Custom for Oracle end of support](rds-custom-for-oracle-end-of-support.md).

A VPN tunnel is an encrypted connection between two or more devices over a network. To
ensure the highest level of security for your Oracle Data Guard instances in RDS Custom for Oracle,
we strongly recommend that you implement a VPN tunnel to encrypt communication between
your primary and standby instances. The tunnel serves as a safeguard for sensitive data
as it travels the network between instances. While this configuration is optional, we
recommend it as a best practice to achieve data security and regulatory compliance.

Make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- You have root access to the primary and standby hosts.

- You have the technical expertise to run the `ipsec` command.

###### To configure a VPN tunnel between a primary and replica in RDS Custom for Oracle

1. Add the security groups for both the primary instance and standby instance to
    the allow list using the following rules:

```

ACTION FLOW SOURCE PROTO PORT

ALLOW ingress this-SG 50 (ESP) all (N/A)
ALLOW egress this-SG 50 (ESP) all (N/A)

ALLOW ingress this-SG 17 (UDP) 500 (IKE)
ALLOW egress this-SG 17 (UDP) 500 (IKE)
```

2. Switch to the root user.

```

$ sudo su – root
```

3. Run the following commands on both the primary instance and the standby
    instance to initialize the Network Security Services (NSS) database under the
    user `root`.

```

ipsec initnss --nssdir /etc/ipsec.d
```

4. Generate RSA keys as follows:
1. On the primary instance, generate the keys using either of the
       following `ipsec` commands, depending on your OS
       version.

      ```

      ipsec newhostkey --nssdir /etc/ipsec.d       ## for Oracle Linux Version 8
      ipsec newhostkey --output /etc/ipsec.secrets ## for Oracle Linux version 7.9
      ```

2. Obtain the public key, which you need to create the configuration. In
       the following example, the primary instance is `left` because
       in `ipsec` parlance, `left` refers to the device
       you are currently configuring, and `right` refers to the
       device at the other end of the tunnel.

      ```nohighlight

      ipsec showhostkey --left --ckaid ckaid-returned-in-last-statement
      ```

3. On the standby instance, generate keys for the standby instance.

      ```

      ipsec newhostkey --nssdir /etc/ipsec.d       ## for Oracle Linux Version 8
      ipsec newhostkey --output /etc/ipsec.secrets ## for Oracle Linux version 7.9
      ```

4. Obtain the public key for the standby instance, which you need to
       create the configuration. In the following example, the standby instance
       is `right` because it refers to the device at the other end
       of the tunnel.

      ```nohighlight

      ipsec showhostkey --right --ckaid ckaid-returned-in-last-statement
      ```
5. Based on the RSA keys that you obtained, generate the configuration. The
    configuration is identical for both the primary instance and the standby
    instance. You can find the primary instance IPv4 address and standby instance
    IPv4 address in the AWS console.

On both the primary instance and the standby instance, save the following
    configuration to the file
    `/etc/ipsec.d/custom-fb-tunnel.conf`.

```nohighlight

conn custom-db-tunnel
    type=transport
    auto=add
    authby=rsasig
    left=IPV4-for-primary
    leftrsasigkey=RSA-key-generated-on-primary
    right=IPV4-for-standby
    rightrsasigkey=RSA-key-generated-on-standby
```

6. On both the primary instance and the standby instance, start the
    `ipsec` daemon on both hosts.

```

ipsec setup start
```

7. Start the tunnel on either the primary instance or the standby instance. The
    output should look similar to the following.

```

[root@ip-172-31-6-81 ~]# ipsec auto --up custom-db-tunnel
181 "custom-db-tunnel" #1: initiating IKEv2 connection
181 "custom-db-tunnel" #1: sent IKE_SA_INIT request to 172.31.32.196:500

[root@ip-172-31-6-81 ~]#
```
