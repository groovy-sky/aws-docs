# Using Amazon RDS delegated extension support for PostgreSQL

Using Amazon RDS delegated extension support for PostgreSQL, you can delegate the extension
management to a user who need not be an `rds_superuser`. With this delegated
extension support, a new role called `rds_extension` is created and you must
assign this to a user to manage other extensions. This role can create, update, and drop
extensions.

You can specify the extensions that can be installed on your RDS DB instance, by listing them in
the `rds.allowed_extensions` parameter. For more information, see [Using PostgreSQL extensions with Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-extensions.md).

You can restrict the list of extensions available that can be managed by the user with the
`rds_extension` role using `rds.allowed_delegated_extensions`
parameter.

The delegated extension support is available in the following versions:

- All higher versions

- 16.4 and higher 16 versions

- 15.8 and higher 15 versions

- 14.13 and higher 14 versions

- 13.16 and higher 13 versions

- 12.20 and higher 12 versions

## Turning on delegate extension support to a user

You must perform the following to enable delegate extension support to a user:

1. Grant `rds_extension` role to a user
    – Connect to the database as `rds_superuser` and execute the
    following command:

```nohighlight

Postgres => grant rds_extension to user_name;
```

2. Set the list of extensions available for delegated users
    to manage – The
    `rds.allowed_delegated_extensions` allows you to specify a subset
    of the available extensions using `rds.allowed_extensions` in the DB
    cluster parameter. You can perform this at one of the following levels:

- In the cluster or the instance parameter group, through the AWS Management Console
or API. For more information, see [Parameter groups for Amazon RDS](user-workingwithparamgroups.md).

- Use the following command at the database level:

```nohighlight

alter database database_name set rds.allowed_delegated_extensions = 'extension_name_1,
                      extension_name_2,...extension_name_n';
```

- Use the following command at the user level:

```nohighlight

alter user user_name set rds.allowed_delegated_extensions = 'extension_name_1,
                      extension_name_2,...extension_name_n';
```

###### Note

You need not restart the database after changing the
`rds.allowed_delegated_extensions` dynamic parameter.

3. Allow access to the delegated user to objects created
    during the extension creation process – Certain extensions
    create objects that require additional permissions to be granted before the user
    with `rds_extension` role can access them. The
    `rds_superuser` must grant the delegated user access to those
    objects. One of the options is to use an event trigger to automatically grant
    permission to the delegated user.

Example of event trigger

If you want to allow a delegated user with `rds_extension` to use
    extensions that require setting permissions on their objects created by the
    extension creation, you can customize the below example of an event trigger and add
    only the extensions for which you want the delegated users to have access to the
    full functionality. This event trigger can be created on template1 (the default
    template), therefore all database created from template1 will have that event
    trigger. When a delegated user installs the extension, this trigger will
    automatically grant ownership on the objects created by the extension.

```

## Configuration used in RDS delegated extension support for PostgreSQL

Configuration NameDescriptionDefault ValueNotesWho can modify or grant permission

`rds.allowed_delegated_extensions`

This parameter limits the extensions a rds\_extension role can
manage in a database. It must be a subset of
rds.allowed\_extensions.

empty string

- By default, this parameter is empty string, which means
that no extensions have been delegated to users with
`rds_extension`.

- Any supported extension can be added if the user has
permission to do so. To do this, set the
`rds.allowed_delegated_extensions` parameter
to a string of comma-separated extension names. By adding a
list of extensions to this parameter, you explicitly
identify the extensions that the user with the
`rds_extension` role can install.

- When set to `*`, it means that all extensions
listed in `rds_allowed_extensions` are delegated
to users with `rds_extension` role.

To learn more about setting up this parameter, see [Turning on delegate extension support to a user](#RDSPostgreSQL.delegated_ext_mgmt).

rds\_superuser

`rds.allowed_extensions`

This parameter lets the customer limit the extensions that can
be installed in the RDS DB instance. For more information, see [Restricting installation of PostgreSQL extensions](chap-postgresql.md#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.FeatureSupport.Extensions.Restriction)

"\*"

By default, this parameter is set to "\*", which means that all
extensions supported on RDS for PostgreSQL and Aurora PostgreSQL are allowed
to be created by users with necessary privileges.

Empty means no extensions can be installed in the
RDS DB instance.

administrator

`rds-delegated_extension_allow_drop_cascade`

This parameter controls the ability for user with
`rds_extension` to drop the extension using a cascade
option.

off

By default,
`rds-delegated_extension_allow_drop_cascade` is set
to `off`. This means that users with
`rds_extension` are not allowed to drop an extension
using the cascade option.

To grant that ability, the
`rds.delegated_extension_allow_drop_cascade`
parameter should be set to `on`.

rds\_superuser

## Turning off the support for the delegated extension

###### Turning off partially

The delegated users can’t create new extensions but can still update existing
extensions.

- Reset `rds.allowed_delegated_extensions` to the default value in
the DB cluster parameter group.

- Use the following command at the database level:

```nohighlight

alter database database_name reset rds.allowed_delegated_extensions;
```

- Use the following command at the user level:

```nohighlight

alter user user_name reset rds.allowed_delegated_extensions;
```

###### Turning off fully

Revoking `rds_extension` role from a user will revert the user to
standard permissions. The user can no longer create, update, or drop extensions.

```nohighlight

postgres => revoke rds_extension from user_name;
```

## Benefits of using Amazon RDS delegated extension support

By using Amazon RDS delegated extension support for PostgreSQL, you securely delegate the
extension management to users who do not have the `rds_superuser` role. This
feature provides the following benefits:

- You can easily delegate extension management to users of your choice.

- This doesn’t require `rds_superuser` role.

- Provides ability to support different set of extensions for different
databases in the same DB cluster.

## Limitation of Amazon RDS delegated extension support for PostgreSQL

- Objects created during the extension creation process may require additional
privileges for the extension to function properly.

- Some extensions can't be managed by the delegated extension user by
default, including the following: `log_fdw`, `pg_cron`, `pg_tle`, `pgactive`, `pglogical`,
`postgis_raster`, `postgis_tiger_geocoder`, `postgis_topology`.

## Permissions required for certain extensions

In order to create, use, or update the following extensions, the delegated user should
have the necessary privileges on the following functions, tables, and schema.

## Security Considerations

Keep in mind that a user with `rds_extension` role will be able to manage
extensions on all databases they have the connect privilege on. If the intention is to
have a delegated user manage extension on a single database, a good practice is to
revoke all privileges from public on each database, then explicitly grant the connect
privilege for that specific database to the delegate user.

There are several extensions that can allow a user to access information from
multiple database. Ensure the users you grant `rds_extension` has cross
database capabilities before adding these extensions to
`rds.allowed_delegated_extensions`. For example,
`postgres_fdw` and `dblink` provide functionality to query
across databases on the same instance or remote instances. `log_fdw` reads
the postgres engine log files, which are for all databases in the instance, potentially
containing slow queries or error messages from multiple databases. `pg_cron`
enables running scheduled background jobs on the DB instance and can configure jobs to run in
a different database.

## Drop extension cascade disabled

The ability to drop the extension with cascade option by a user with the
`rds_extension` role is controlled by
`rds.delegated_extension_allow_drop_cascade` parameter. By default,
`rds-delegated_extension_allow_drop_cascade` is set to `off`.
This means that users with the `rds_extension` role are not allowed to drop
an extension using the cascade option as shown in the below query.

```

DROP EXTENSION CASCADE;
```

As this will automatically drop objects that depend on the extension, and in turn all
objects that depend on those objects. Attempting to use the cascade option will result
in an error.

To grant that ability, the `rds.delegated_extension_allow_drop_cascade`
parameter should be set to `on`.

Changing the `rds.delegated_extension_allow_drop_cascade` dynamic
parameter doesn't require a database restart. You can do this at one of the following
levels:

- In the cluster or the instance parameter group, through the AWS Management Console or
API.

- Using the following command at the database level:

```nohighlight

alter database database_name set rds.delegated_extension_allow_drop_cascade = 'on';
```

- Using the following command at the user level:

```

alter role tenant_user set rds.delegated_extension_allow_drop_cascade = 'on';
```
