# Initial troubleshooting for common PostgreSQL performance issues in RDS for PostgreSQL

This guide covers the four most common performance issues that affect RDS for PostgreSQL databases: table and index bloat, parallel query resource exhaustion,
high connection and authentication pressure, and autovacuum tuning. Use this guide as a
first-pass diagnostic checklist when you experience performance degradation, before you begin
deeper investigation.

Each section describes the symptoms you might observe, provides diagnostic queries to
confirm the root cause, and recommends specific remediation steps.

###### Understanding "nothing changed" performance regressions

PostgreSQL workloads often run without issues for weeks or months, then experience sudden
performance degradation even though the application code and query patterns appear unchanged.
This happens because the database environment is never truly static — several invisible factors
shift over time and can trigger plan changes or resource contention:

- **Bloat accumulation is a workload change.** PostgreSQL's
multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) retains old row versions until autovacuum reclaims
them. When dead tuples accumulate faster than autovacuum can process them, tables and
indexes grow physically larger. The query planner may then switch from efficient index
scans to sequential scans because the cost estimates shift as the table size increases.
Your SQL hasn't changed, but the data the planner sees has.

- **New parameter values are a workload change.** A
parameterized query that performs well for one range of values can perform poorly when the
application begins using a different range. PostgreSQL may reuse a generic execution plan
that doesn't account for data skew in the new range, or the planner's statistics may not
accurately reflect the distribution for those values. When bloat is also present, the
impact compounds — a suboptimal plan now scans significantly more dead data.

- **Statistics can be stale even when autovacuum runs.**
Autovacuum triggers `ANALYZE` based on the number of rows inserted or updated,
not on whether the data distribution has meaningfully changed. If your application shifts
to querying a different value range or time window, the planner's cost estimates may be
inaccurate even though autovacuum has run recently.

- **Overall database growth is a workload change.** As
tables grow over time, the volume of data pages that queries must scan increases. Queries
that performed well on smaller tables may develop latency as the table size grows, even
when the query logic and indexes remain unchanged. Monitor `FreeStorageSpace` to track storage growth
trends.

When you investigate performance regressions where "nothing changed," treat bloat
accumulation, new parameter value ranges, overall database growth, and stale statistics as the most likely root
causes. Use the diagnostic steps in this guide to confirm which factor applies.

## Quick diagnostic checklist

Use the following ordered triage steps when you first investigate a performance
issue:

1. **Check `pg_stat_activity`.** Look at
    connection count, idle-in-transaction sessions, and long-running queries. For more
    information, see [Essential concepts for RDS for PostgreSQL tuning](postgresql-tuning-concepts.md).

2. **Check for bloat.** Look for high
    `n_dead_tup` in `pg_stat_user_tables` and consider using
    `pgstattuple` for precise measurement. For more information, see [Removing bloat from tables with pg\_repack](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-pg-repack.md).

3. **Check `pg_stat_user_tables`.** Look for
    high `n_dead_tup` values and stale `last_autovacuum`
    timestamps. For more information, see [Working with PostgreSQL autovacuum on Amazon RDS](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-autovacuum.md).

4. **Review `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on slow**
**queries.** Look for parallel plans and sequential scans on large tables. For
    more information, see [Best practices for parallel queries in RDS for PostgreSQL](postgresql-parallelqueries.md).

5. **Check CloudWatch and Performance Insights metrics.** Review
    CPU utilization, connection count, IOPS, and freeable memory. For more information, see
    [Monitoring Amazon RDS](monitoringoverview.md). For common wait events and corrective actions, see [RDS for PostgreSQL wait events](postgresql-tuning-concepts-summary.md).

6. **Review your DB parameter group.** Check
    `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` and autovacuum settings. For more
    information, see [Tuning PostgreSQL parameters in Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora](../../../prescriptive-guidance/latest/tuning-postgresql-parameters/introduction.md).

## Table and index bloat

Table and index bloat occurs when dead tuples accumulate in your tables faster than
autovacuum can reclaim them. Over time, this causes gradual query performance degradation,
increased storage usage, and suboptimal query plans.

### Symptoms

- Gradual query performance degradation over weeks or months

- Storage usage growing despite stable data volume

- The query planner chooses sequential scans over index scans due to stale
statistics

- High `dead_tuple_count` in table statistics

### Diagnosis

You can estimate bloat across all tables by querying the system catalog. This approach
does not require any extensions:

```

SELECT schemaname, relname,
       n_dead_tup,
       n_live_tup,
       ROUND(n_dead_tup::numeric / GREATEST(n_live_tup, 1) * 100, 2) AS dead_pct,
       last_autovacuum,
       last_autoanalyze
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE n_dead_tup > 10000
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

To address bloat, you can use the `pg_repack` extension to reorganize tables
and indexes with minimal locking. For more information, see [Removing bloat from tables with pg\_repack](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-pg-repack.md) and [Remove bloat from Amazon Aurora and RDS for PostgreSQL with pg\_repack](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/remove-bloat-from-amazon-aurora-and-rds-for-postgresql-with-pg_repack).

###### Important

Rather than relying on manual maintenance, ensure that autovacuum is enabled and
properly tuned for your workload. See [Autovacuum tuning](#PostgreSQL.InitialTroubleshooting.Autovacuum) for tuning
recommendations.

## Parallel query resource exhaustion

PostgreSQL can execute queries in parallel to improve performance for large sequential
scans and aggregations. However, each parallel worker is a full backend process that counts
against `max_worker_processes` (and the sub-limit
`max_parallel_workers`) and allocates its own `work_mem`. A single
query with 4 parallel workers can consume hundreds of megabytes of memory and significant CPU.
Under high concurrency, excessive parallelism can exhaust CPU and memory rapidly.

Common symptoms include sudden CPU spikes, high memory usage per query, and elevated
`DatabaseConnections` in CloudWatch
without application changes. You may also observe wait events such as
`IPC:BgWorkerStartup`, `IPC:ExecuteGather`, and
`IPC:ParallelFinish`. For more information about these wait events, see
[IPC:parallel wait events](rpg-ipc-parallel.md).

For most OLTP and high-concurrency production workloads, disable automatic parallelism by
setting `max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 0` in your DB parameter group. You can
then selectively enable parallelism for specific analytics or reporting sessions by setting the
parameter per session or per role.

For detailed guidance on diagnosing and controlling parallel query behavior, see [Best practices for parallel queries in RDS for PostgreSQL](postgresql-parallelqueries.md).

## High connection and authentication pressure

Connection churn — frequent opening and closing of database connections without pooling —
creates authentication overhead and can exhaust available connection slots. Idle connections
that remain open also consume slots without performing useful work.

### Symptoms

- Elevated `total_auth_attempts` in Performance Insights monitoring. For more information, see [Non-native counters for RDS for PostgreSQL](user-perfinsights-counters.md#USER_PerfInsights_Counters.PostgreSQL.NonNative).

- Slow connection establishment times

- `FATAL: too many connections for role` or `remaining connection
                slots are reserved` errors

- CPU spikes correlated with connection churn

### Diagnosis

Run the following query to check your current connection state:

```

SELECT
  setting::int AS max_connections,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity) AS current_connections,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'idle') AS idle_connections,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'idle in transaction') AS idle_in_txn
FROM pg_settings
WHERE name = 'max_connections';
```

A high number of `idle` or `idle in transaction` connections
relative to `max_connections` indicates that connections are not being released
properly. Idle-in-transaction connections are especially problematic because they hold locks
and prevent autovacuum from reclaiming dead tuples.

### Remediation

- **Deploy connection pooling.** Use PgBouncer or
Amazon RDS Proxy to reduce the number of direct connections to your database.
Connection pooling reuses existing connections rather than creating new ones for each
request.

- **Set**
**`idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`.** This parameter
automatically terminates sessions that remain idle in a transaction beyond the specified
duration. This prevents long-running idle transactions from holding locks and blocking
autovacuum.

- **Review application connection handling.** Ensure your
application closes connections promptly and does not hold transactions open longer than
necessary.

###### Note

Parallel query workers consume CPU and memory. If you observe resource
exhaustion alongside parallel query activity, see [Parallel query resource exhaustion](#PostgreSQL.InitialTroubleshooting.ParallelQuery) for guidance on controlling
parallel worker usage.

## Using Performance Insights wait events for troubleshooting

Performance Insights captures wait events that show where your database is spending time.
When you investigate performance issues, wait events help you identify whether the bottleneck
is CPU, I/O, locking, network, or inter-process communication. Common wait event categories
that appear during the issues described in this guide include:

- **CPU** — The session is active on CPU or waiting for
CPU. High CPU wait events often correlate with excessive parallelism or inefficient query
plans scanning bloated tables.

- **IPC (inter-process communication)** — Wait events such
as `IPC:BgWorkerStartup`, `IPC:ExecuteGather`, and
`IPC:ParallelFinish` indicate parallel query coordination overhead.

- **IO** — Wait events such as
`IO:DataFileRead` indicate that queries are reading data from storage because
the required pages are not in shared memory. This is common when bloated tables exceed the
buffer cache.

- **Lock** — Wait events such as
`Lock:transactionid` and `Lock:tuple` indicate contention between
sessions. Idle-in-transaction connections can hold locks that block other queries and
autovacuum.

- **Client** — Wait events such as
`Client:ClientRead` indicate the database is waiting for the application to
send data. High client wait events can indicate connection churn or network latency.

For a complete reference of wait events that commonly indicate performance problems and
their recommended corrective actions, see [RDS for PostgreSQL wait events](postgresql-tuning-concepts-summary.md).

## Autovacuum tuning

Autovacuum is the background process that reclaims dead tuples, prevents table and index
bloat, updates planner statistics, and protects against transaction ID wraparound. The default
autovacuum settings are conservative and designed for small databases. High-write production
workloads almost always require tuning.

When autovacuum cannot keep up with your write workload, bloat accumulates, planner
statistics become stale, and the risk of transaction ID wraparound increases. If
`age(relfrozenxid)` approaches 2 billion, the database shuts down to prevent data
corruption.

For detailed guidance on tuning autovacuum parameters, monitoring vacuum activity, and
configuring per-table overrides, see [Working with PostgreSQL autovacuum on Amazon RDS](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-autovacuum.md).
