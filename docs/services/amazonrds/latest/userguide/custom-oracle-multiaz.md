# Managing a Multi-AZ deployment for RDS Custom for Oracle

###### Note

End of support notice: On March 31, 2027, AWS will end support for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. After March 31, 2027, you will no longer be able to access the RDS Custom for Oracle console or RDS Custom for Oracle resources. For more information, see [RDS Custom for Oracle end of support](rds-custom-for-oracle-end-of-support.md).

In a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment for RDS Custom for Oracle, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and
maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone (AZ). The primary
DB instance is synchronously replicated across Availability Zones to a standby replica to
provide data redundancy.

A Multi-AZ DB instance deployment enhances availability during planned system maintenance. If
planned database maintenance or unplanned service disruption occurs, Amazon RDS automatically
fails over to the up-to-date standby DB instance. Database operations can resume quickly without
manual intervention. The primary and standby instances use the same endpoint, whose physical
network address transitions to the standby replica as part of the failover process. You
don't need to reconfigure your application when a failover occurs.

The following diagram shows the Multi-AZ architecture for RDS Custom for Oracle:

![Amazon RDS architecture with primary DB instance and standby replica in separate availability zones.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/custom-oracle-multiaz-architecture.png)

The Amazon RDS console shows the Availability Zone of the standby replica (the secondary AZ).
You can also use the `describe-db-instances` CLI command or the
`DescribeDBInstances` API operation to find the secondary AZ.

## Region and version availability for a Multi-AZ deployment for RDS Custom for Oracle

Multi-AZ deployments for RDS Custom for Oracle are supported for the following releases for both Enterprise
Edition (EE) and Standard Edition 2 (SE2):

- Oracle Database 19c

- Oracle Database 12c Release 2 (12.2)

- Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1)

###### Note

Multi-AZ deployments for RDS Custom for Oracle aren't supported on Oracle Database 18c.

Multi-AZ deployments for RDS Custom for Oracle are available in all Regions where RDS Custom for Oracle is
available. For more information on Region availability of Multi-AZ deployments for
RDS Custom for Oracle, see [Supported Regions and DB engines for RDS Custom for Oracle](concepts-rds-fea-regions-db-eng-feature-rdscustom.md#Concepts.RDS_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.RDSCustom.ora).

## Limitations for a Multi-AZ deployment in RDS Custom for Oracle

Multi-AZ deployments with RDS Custom for Oracle have the following limitations:

- If your DB instance was created before June 30, 2025, you can't convert from a
Single-AZ to Multi-AZ deployment. Your underlying Custom Engine Version (CEV) was built
with an older service-provided AMI that lacks Multi-AZ support. You must migrate
your database to a new DB instance using a CEV that you create with a service-provided
AMI after June 30, 2025. For details, see [Migration steps for DB instances using CEVs created before June 30, 2025](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-oracle-multiaz-prerequisites.html#migration-using-older-CEVs).

- You can't create cross-Region Multi-AZ deployments.

- You can't configure the standby DB instance to accept database read
activity.

- When you use a Custom Engine Version (CEV) with a Multi-AZ deployment, your standby
DB instance uses the same CEV. The standby DB instance can't use a different CEV.

- You can't create a read replica on a Multi-AZ deployment instance and you also
cannot modify the primary instance of the read replica to have a Multi-AZ
deployment.

- RDS Custom for Oracle DB instances with Multi-AZ deployment can have increased write and commit latency
compared to a Single-AZ deployment. This increase can happen because of the
synchronous data replication between DB instances. You might have a change in latency
if your deployment fails over to the standby replica, although AWS is
engineered with low-latency network connectivity between Availability
Zones.

## Creating a Multi-AZ deployment in RDS Custom for Oracle

To create an RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance with a Multi-AZ deployment, follow the steps in [Setting up your environment for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle](custom-setup-orcl.md) to set up your environment with the
prerequisites.

###### Important

To simplify setup, we recommend that you use the latest CloudFormation template file
provided in the network setup instructions. For more information, see [Deploying RDS Custom for Oracle with AWS CloudFormation](custom-oracle-multiaz-deployment.md).

You can create an RDS Custom for Oracle instance with a Multi-AZ deployment by choosing the
**Multi-AZ** option during the database instance creation in the
Amazon RDS console. Alternatively, you can specify the `--multi-az` parameter in
the Amazon RDS `create-db-instance` command in the AWS CLI.
