# Working with Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server logs

You can use the Amazon RDS console to view, watch, and download SQL Server Agent logs, Microsoft SQL Server error logs, and SQL Server
Reporting Services (SSRS) logs.

## Watching log files

If you view a log in the Amazon RDS console, you can see its contents as they exist at that
moment. Watching a log in the console opens it in a dynamic state so that you can
see updates to it in near-real time.

Only the latest log is active for watching. For example, suppose you have the following
logs shown:

![An image of the Logs section from the Amazon RDS console with an error log selected.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/logs_sqlserver.png)

Only log/ERROR, as the most recent log, is being actively updated. You can choose to watch
others, but they are static and will not update.

## Archiving log files

The Amazon RDS console shows logs for the past week through the current day. You can download
and archive logs to keep them for reference past that time. One way to archive logs
is to load them into an Amazon S3 bucket. For instructions on how to set up an Amazon S3
bucket and upload a file, see [Amazon S3\
basics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/AmazonS3Basics.html) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service Getting Started Guide_ and
click **Get Started**.

## Viewing error and agent logs

To view Microsoft SQL Server error and agent logs, use the Amazon RDS stored procedure `rds_read_error_log` with the
following parameters:

- **`@index`** – the version
of the log to retrieve. The default value is 0, which retrieves the current
error log. Specify 1 to retrieve the previous log, specify 2 to retrieve the
one before that, and so on.

- **`@type`** – the type of
log to retrieve. Specify 1 to retrieve an error log. Specify 2 to retrieve
an agent log.

###### Example

The following example requests the current error log.

```sql

EXEC rdsadmin.dbo.rds_read_error_log @index = 0, @type = 1;
```

For more information on SQL Server errors, see [Database\
engine errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/database-engine-events-and-errors) in the Microsoft documentation.
