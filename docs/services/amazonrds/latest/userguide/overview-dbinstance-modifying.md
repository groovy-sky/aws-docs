# Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance

You can change the settings of a DB instance to accomplish tasks such as adding additional
storage or changing the DB instance class. In this topic, you can find out how to modify an
Amazon RDS DB instance and learn about the settings for DB instances.

We recommend that you test any changes on a test instance before modifying a production
instance. Doing this helps you to fully understand the impact of each change. Testing is
especially important when upgrading database versions.

Most modifications to a DB instance you can either apply immediately or defer until the
next maintenance window. Some modifications, such as parameter group changes, require that
you manually reboot your DB instance for the change to take effect.

###### Important

Some modifications result in downtime because Amazon RDS must reboot your DB instance for the change to take effect. Review the
impact to your database and applications before modifying your DB instance settings.

###### To modify a DB instance

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then choose
    the DB instance that you want to modify.

3. Choose **Modify**. The **Modify DB instance** page appears.

4. Change any of the settings that you want.
    For information about each setting, see
    [Settings for DB instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ModifyInstance.Settings.html).

5. When all the changes are as you want them,
    choose **Continue** and check the summary of modifications.

6. (Optional) Choose **Apply immediately** to apply the changes immediately. Choosing this option
    can cause downtime in some cases. For more information, see [Using the schedule modifications setting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ModifyInstance.ApplyImmediately.html).

7. On the confirmation page, review your changes. If they are correct, choose **Modify DB instance**
    to save your changes.

Or choose **Back** to edit your changes or
    **Cancel** to cancel your changes.

To modify a DB instance by using the AWS CLI, call the [modify-db-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html)
command. Specify the DB instance identifier and the values for the options that you
want to modify. For information about each option, see [Settings for DB instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ModifyInstance.Settings.html).

###### Example

The following code modifies `mydbinstance`
by setting the backup retention period to 1 week (7 days).
The code enables deletion protection by using `--deletion-protection`.
To disable deletion protection, use `--no-deletion-protection`.
The changes are applied during the next maintenance window
by using `--no-apply-immediately`. Use `--apply-immediately`
to apply the changes immediately. For more information, see
[Using the schedule modifications setting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ModifyInstance.ApplyImmediately.html).

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
    --backup-retention-period 7 \
    --deletion-protection \
    --no-apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance ^
    --backup-retention-period 7 ^
    --deletion-protection ^
    --no-apply-immediately
```

###### Example

The following example adds a storage volume to an RDS for Oracle DB instance. The
additional volume uses gp3 storage with 5000 GiB of allocated storage and 12000
IOPS.

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
     --db-instance-identifier my-oracle-instance \
     --additional-storage-volumes '[{ \
             "VolumeName": "rdsdbdata2", \
             "StorageType": "gp3",
             "AllocatedStorage": 5000, \
             "IOPS": 12000 \
         }]'
```

To modify a DB instance by using the Amazon RDS API, call the
[ModifyDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbinstance.md) operation.
Specify the DB instance identifier,
and the parameters for the settings that you want to modify.
For information about each parameter, see
[Settings for DB instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ModifyInstance.Settings.html).
