# Viewing a blue/green deployment in Amazon RDS

You can view the details about a blue/green deployment using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

You can also view and subscribe to events for information about a blue/green deployment. For more information, see
[Blue/green deployment events](user-events-messages.md#USER_Events.Messages.BlueGreenDeployments).

###### To view the details about a blue/green deployment

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then find the blue/green deployment
    in the list.

![Blue/green deployment in the database list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/blue-green-deployment-view-db-list.png)

The **Role** value for the blue/green deployment is **Blue/Green Deployment**.

3. Choose the name of blue/green deployment that you want to view to display its details.

Each tab has a section for the blue deployment and a section for the green
    deployment. For example, on the **Configuration** tab, the DB engine
    version might be different in the blue environment and in the green environment if
    you're upgrading the DB engine version in the green environment.

The following image shows an example of the **Connectivity &**
**security** tab:

The **Connectivity & security** tab also includes a section
    called **Replication**, which shows the current state of replication
    and replica lag between the blue and green environments. If the replication state is
    `Replicating`, the blue/green deployment is replicating
    successfully.

For RDS for PostgreSQL blue/green deployments that use logical
    replication, the replication state can change to `Replication
                 degraded` if you make unsupported DDL or large object changes in the blue
    environment. For more information, see [Logical replication-specific limitations for blue/green deployments](blue-green-deployments-considerations.md#blue-green-deployments-limitations-postgres).

The following image shows an example of the **Configuration**
    tab:

The following image shows an example of the **Status** tab:

![Blue/green deployment status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/blue-green-deployment-view-status.png)

To view the details about a blue/green deployment by using the AWS CLI, use the [describe-blue-green-deployments](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-blue-green-deployments.md) command.

###### Example View the details about a blue/green deployment by filtering on its name

When you use the [describe-blue-green-deployments](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-blue-green-deployments.md) command, you can filter on the
`--blue-green-deployment-name`.

The following example shows the details for a blue/green deployment named
`my-blue-green-deployment`.

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-blue-green-deployments \
  --filters Name=blue-green-deployment-name,Values=my-blue-green-deployment
```

###### Example View the details about a blue/green deployment by specifying its identifier

When you use the [describe-blue-green-deployments](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-blue-green-deployments.md) command, you can specify the
`--blue-green-deployment-identifier` option.

The following example shows the details for a blue/green deployment with the
identifier `bgd-1234567890abcdef`.

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-blue-green-deployments \
  --blue-green-deployment-identifier bgd-1234567890abcdef
```

To view the details about a blue/green deployment by using the Amazon RDS API, use the [`DescribeBlueGreenDeployments`](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describebluegreendeployments.md) operation and specify the `BlueGreenDeploymentIdentifier`.
