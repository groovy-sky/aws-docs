# Tagging RDS Custom for SQL Server resources

You can tag RDS Custom resources as with Amazon RDS resources, but with some important differences:

- Don't create or modify the `AWSRDSCustom` tag that's required for RDS Custom automation. If you do, you
might break the automation.

- The `Name` tag is added to RDS Custom resources with the prefix
`do-not-delete-rds-custom`. Any customer-passed value for the key is
overwritten.

- Tags added to RDS Custom DB instances during creation are propagated to all other related RDS Custom resources.

- Tags aren't propagated when you add them to RDS Custom resources after DB instance creation.

For general information about resource tagging, see [Tagging Amazon RDS resources](user-tagging.md).
