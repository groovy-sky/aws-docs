# Troubleshooting access to Amazon S3

If you encounter connection problems when attempting to export data to Amazon S3, first confirm that the outbound access rules for
the VPC security group associated with your DB instance permit network connectivity. Specifically, the security group must have a rule
that allows the DB instance to send TCP traffic to port 443 and to any IPv4 addresses (0.0.0.0/0). For more information, see [Provide access to your DB instance in your VPC by creating a security group](chap-settingup.md#CHAP_SettingUp.SecurityGroup).
