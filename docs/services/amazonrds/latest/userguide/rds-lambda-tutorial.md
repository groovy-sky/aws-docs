# Tutorial: Using a Lambda function to access an Amazon RDS database

In this tutorial, you use a Lambda function to write data to an [Amazon Relational Database Service](welcome.md) (Amazon RDS) database through
RDS Proxy. Your Lambda function reads records from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue and writes a new item
to a table in your database whenever a message is added. In this example, you use the AWS Management Console
to manually add messages to your queue. The following diagram shows the AWS resources you use
to complete the tutorial.

![An instance of the AWS Management Console connects to an Amazon SQS standard queue, which connects to a Lambda function, which further connects to a RDS for MySQL database through RDS Proxy.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/TUT_Lambda_1.png)

With Amazon RDS, you can run a managed relational database in the cloud using common database
products like Microsoft SQL Server, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle Database, and PostgreSQL. By using
Lambda to access your database, you can read and write data in response to events, such as a new
customer registering with your website. Your function, database instance, and proxy scale
automatically to meet periods of high demand.

To complete this tutorial, you carry out the following tasks:

1. Launch an RDS for MySQL database instance and a proxy in your AWS account's default
    VPC.

2. Create and test a Lambda function that creates a new table in your database and writes data to it.

3. Create an Amazon SQS queue and configure it to invoke your Lambda function whenever a new message is added.

4. Test the complete setup by adding messages to your queue using the AWS Management Console and
    monitoring the results using CloudWatch Logs.

By completing these steps, you learn:

- How to use Amazon RDS to create a database instance and a proxy, and connect a Lambda function to
the proxy.

- How to use Lambda to perform create and read operations on an Amazon RDS database.

- How to use Amazon SQS to invoke a Lambda function.

You can complete this tutorial using the AWS Management Console or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, complete the steps in the following sections:

- [Sign up for an AWS account](chap-settingup.md#sign-up-for-aws)

- [Create a user with administrative access](chap-settingup.md#create-an-admin)

## Create an Amazon RDS DB instance

![Tutorial workflow diagram showing you are the create database step.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/TUT_Lambda_step1.png)

An Amazon RDS DB instance is an isolated database environment running in the AWS Cloud. An
instance can contain one or more user-created databases. Unless you specify otherwise, Amazon RDS
creates new database instances in the default VPC included in your AWS account. For more
information about Amazon VPC, see the [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.md).

In this tutorial, you create a new instance in your AWS account's default VPC and create
a database named `ExampleDB` in that instance. You can create your DB instance and
database using either the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.

###### To create a database instance

1. Open the Amazon RDS console and choose **Create database**.

2. Leave the **Standard create** option selected, then in
    **Engine options**, choose **MySQL**.

3. In **Templates**, choose **Free tier** or **Sandbox**. **Free tier** appears for
    free tier accounts. **Sandbox** appears for paid plan
    accounts.

4. In **Settings**, for **DB instance identifier**,
    enter `MySQLForLambda`.

5. Set your username and password by doing the following:
1. In **Credentials settings**, leave **Master**
      **username** set to `admin`.

2. For **Master password**, enter and confirm a password to access
       your database.
6. Specify the database name by doing the following:

- Leave all the remaining default options selected and scroll down to the
**Additional configuration** section.

- Expand this section and enter `ExampleDB` as the
**Initial database name**.

7. Leave all the remaining default options selected and choose **Create**
**database**.

## Create Lambda function and proxy

![Tutorial workflow diagram showing you are in the Lambda function step creating an execution role.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/TUT_Lambda_step2.png)

You can use the RDS console to create a Lambda function and a proxy in the same VPC as the
database.

###### Note

You can only create these associated resources when your database has completed creation
and is in **Available** status.

###### To create an associated function and proxy

1. From the **Databases** page, check if your database is in the
    **Available** status. If so, proceed to the next step. Else, wait till
    your database is available.

2. Select your database and choose **Set up Lambda connection** from
    **Actions**.

3. In the **Set up Lambda connection** page, choose **Create new**
**function**.

Set the **New Lambda function name** to `LambdaFunctionWithRDS`.

4. In the **RDS Proxy** section, select the **Connect using**
**RDS Proxy** option. Further choose **Create new proxy**.

- For **Database credentials**, choose **Database**
**username and password**.

- For **Username**, specify `admin`.

- For **Password**, enter the password you created for your
database instance.

5. Select **Set up** to complete the proxy and Lambda function
    creation.

The wizard completes the set up and provides a link to the Lambda console to review your
new function. Note the proxy endpoint before switching to the Lambda console.

## Create a function execution role

![Tutorial workflow diagram showing you are in the Lambda function step creating an execution role.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/TUT_Lambda_step3.png)

Before you create your Lambda function, you create an execution role to give your function
the necessary permissions. For this tutorial, Lambda needs permission to manage the network
connection to the VPC containing your database instance and to poll messages from an Amazon SQS
queue.

To give your Lambda function the permissions it needs, this tutorial uses IAM managed policies. These are policies that grant
permissions for many common use cases and are available in your AWS account. For more information about using managed policies, see
[Policy best practices](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#security_iam_service-with-iam-policy-best-practices).

###### To create the Lambda execution role

1. Open the [Roles](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home) page of the IAM console and choose **Create role**.

2. For the **Trusted entity type**, choose **AWS**
**service**, and for the **Use case**, choose
    **Lambda**.

3. Choose **Next**.

4. Add the IAM managed policies by doing the following:
1. Using the policy search box, search for `AWSLambdaSQSQueueExecutionRole`.

2. In the results list, select the check box next to the role, then choose
       **Clear filters**.

3. Using the policy search box, search for
       `AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole`.

4. In the results list, select the check box next to the role, then choose
       **Next**.
5. For the **Role name**, enter
    `lambda-vpc-sqs-role`, then choose **Create**
**role**.

Later in the tutorial, you need the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution role you just created.

###### To find the execution role ARN

1. Open the [Roles](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home) page of the
    IAM console and choose your role ( `lambda-vpc-sqs-role`).

2. Copy the **ARN** displayed in the **Summary**
    section.

## Create a Lambda deployment package

![Tutorial workflow diagram showing you are in the Lambda function step creating a deployment package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/TUT_Lambda_step4.png)

The following example Python code uses the [PyMySQL](https://pymysql.readthedocs.io/en/latest) package to open a connection to your database. The first time you
invoke your function, it also creates a new table called `Customer`. The table uses the following schema, where
`CustID` is the primary key:

```

Customer(CustID, Name)
```

The function also uses PyMySQL to add records to this table. The function adds records using customer IDs and
names specified in messages you will add to your Amazon SQS queue.

The code creates the connection to your database outside of the handler function. Creating
the connection in the initialization code allows the connection to be re-used by subsequent
invocations of your function and improves performance. In a production application, you can
also use [provisioned concurrency](../../../lambda/latest/dg/provisioned-concurrency.md) to initialize a requested number of database connections.
These connections are available as soon as your function is invoked.

```python

import sys
import logging
import pymysql
import json
import os

# rds settings
user_name = os.environ['USER_NAME']
password = os.environ['PASSWORD']
rds_proxy_host = os.environ['RDS_PROXY_HOST']
db_name = os.environ['DB_NAME']

logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# create the database connection outside of the handler to allow connections to be
# re-used by subsequent function invocations.
try:
        conn = pymysql.connect(host=rds_proxy_host, user=user_name, passwd=password, db=db_name, connect_timeout=5)
except pymysql.MySQLError as e:
    logger.error("ERROR: Unexpected error: Could not connect to MySQL instance.")
    logger.error(e)
    sys.exit(1)

logger.info("SUCCESS: Connection to RDS for MySQL instance succeeded")

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    """
    This function creates a new RDS database table and writes records to it
    """
    message = event['Records'][0]['body']
    data = json.loads(message)
    CustID = data['CustID']
    Name = data['Name']

    item_count = 0
    sql_string = f"insert into Customer (CustID, Name) values(%s, %s)"

    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("create table if not exists Customer ( CustID  int NOT NULL, Name varchar(255) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (CustID))")
        cur.execute(sql_string, (CustID, Name))
        conn.commit()
        cur.execute("select * from Customer")
        logger.info("The following items have been added to the database:")
        for row in cur:
            item_count += 1
            logger.info(row)
    conn.commit()

    return "Added %d items to RDS for MySQL table" %(item_count)

```

###### Note

In this example, your database access credentials are stored as environment variables. In
production applications, we recommend that you use [AWS Secrets Manager](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.md) as a more secure
option. Note that if your Lambda function is in a VPC, to connect to Secrets Manager you need to create
a VPC endpoint. See [How to connect to Secrets Manager service within a Virtual Private Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-connect-to-aws-secrets-manager-service-within-a-virtual-private-cloud) to learn more.

To include the PyMySQL dependency with your function code, create a .zip deployment
package. The following commands work for Linux, macOS, or Unix:

###### To create a .zip deployment package

1. Save the example code as a file named `lambda_function.py`.

2. In the same directory in which you created your `lambda_function.py` file,
    create a new directory named `package` and install the PyMySQL library.

```nohighlight

mkdir package
pip install --target package pymysql
```

3. Create a zip file containing your application code and the PyMySQL library. In Linux
    or MacOS, run the following CLI commands. In Windows, use your preferred zip tool to create the `lambda_function.zip` file. Your
    `lambda_function.py` source code file and the folders containing your dependencies must be installed at the root of the .zip
    file.

```nohighlight

cd package
zip -r ../lambda_function.zip .
cd ..
zip lambda_function.zip lambda_function.py
```

You can also create your deployment package using a Python virtual environment. See [Deploy Python Lambda functions with .zip file archives](../../../lambda/latest/dg/python-package.md#python-package-create-package-with-dependency).

## Update the Lambda function

Using the .zip package you just created, you now update your Lambda function using the
Lambda console. To enable your function to access your database, you also need to configure
environment variables with your access credentials.

###### To update the Lambda function

1. Open the [Functions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home) page of
    the Lambda console and choose your function `LambdaFunctionWithRDS`.

2. In the **Runtime settings** tab, select **Edit** to
    change the **Runtime** of the function to **Python**
**3.10**.

3. Change the **Handler** to
    `lambda_function.lambda_handler`.

4. In the **Code** tab, choose **Upload from** and then
    **.zip file**.

5. Select the `lambda_function.zip` file you created in the previous stage and
    choose **Save**.

Now configure the function with the execution role you created earlier. This grants the
function the permissions it needs to access your database instance and poll an Amazon SQS
queue.

###### To configure the function's execution role

1. In the [Functions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home) page of
    the Lambda console, select the **Configuration** tab, then choose
    **Permissions**.

2. In **Execution role**, choose **Edit**.

3. In **Existing role**, choose your execution role
    ( `lambda-vpc-sqs-role`).

4. Choose **Save**.

###### To configure your function's environment variables

1. In the [Functions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home) page of
    the Lambda console, select the **Configuration** tab, then choose
    **Environment variables**.

2. Choose **Edit**.

3. To add your database access credentials, do the following:
1. Choose **Add environment variable**, then for
       **Key** enter `USER_NAME` and for
       **Value** enter `admin`.

2. Choose **Add environment variable**, then for
       **Key** enter `DB_NAME` and for
       **Value** enter `ExampleDB`.

3. Choose **Add environment variable**, then for
       **Key** enter `PASSWORD` and for
       **Value** enter the password you chose when you created your
       database.

4. Choose **Add environment variable**, then for
       **Key** enter `RDS_PROXY_HOST` and for
       **Value** enter the RDS Proxy endpoint you noted earlier.

5. Choose **Save**.

## Test your Lambda function in the console

![Tutorial workflow diagram showing you are in the Lambda function step testing the function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/TUT_Lambda_step5.png)

You can now use the Lambda console to test your function. You create a test event which mimics the data your function will
receive when you invoke it using Amazon SQS in the final stage of the tutorial. Your test event contains a JSON object specifying a
customer ID and customer name to add to the `Customer` table your function creates.

###### To test the Lambda function

1. Open the [Functions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home) page of the Lambda console and
    choose your function.

2. Choose the **Test** section.

3. Choose **Create new event** and enter
    `myTestEvent` for the event name.

4. Copy the following code into **Event JSON** and choose **Save**.

```json

{
     "Records": [
       {
         "messageId": "059f36b4-87a3-44ab-83d2-661975830a7d",
         "receiptHandle": "AQEBwJnKyrHigUMZj6rYigCgxlaS3SLy0a...",
         "body": "{\n     \"CustID\": 1021,\n     \"Name\": \"Martha Rivera\"\n}",
         "attributes": {
           "ApproximateReceiveCount": "1",
           "SentTimestamp": "1545082649183",
           "SenderId": "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED",
           "ApproximateFirstReceiveTimestamp": "1545082649185"
         },
         "messageAttributes": {},
         "md5OfBody": "e4e68fb7bd0e697a0ae8f1bb342846b3",
         "eventSource": "aws:sqs",
         "eventSourceARN": "arn:aws:sqs:us-west-2:123456789012:my-queue",
         "awsRegion": "us-west-2"
       }
     ]
}
```

5. Choose **Test**.

In the **Execution results** tab, you should see results similar to the
following displayed in the **Function Logs**:

```nohighlight

[INFO] 2023-02-14T19:31:35.149Z bdd06682-00c7-4d6f-9abb-89f4bbb4a27f The following items have been added to the database:
[INFO] 2023-02-14T19:31:35.149Z bdd06682-00c7-4d6f-9abb-89f4bbb4a27f (1021, 'Martha Rivera')
```

## Create an Amazon SQS queue

![Tutorial workflow diagram showing you are in the message queue step creating the queue.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/TUT_Lambda_step6.png)

You have successfully tested the integration of your Lambda function and Amazon RDS database
instance. Now you create the Amazon SQS queue you will use to invoke your Lambda function in the
final stage of the tutorial.

###### To create the Amazon SQS queue (console)

1. Open the [Queues](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs/v2/home) page of the
    Amazon SQS console and select **Create queue**.

2. Leave the **Type** as **Standard** and enter
    `LambdaRDSQueue` for the name of your queue.

3. Leave all the default options selected and choose **Create**
**queue**.

## Create an event source mapping to invoke your Lambda function

![Tutorial workflow diagram showing you are in the message queue step creating an event source mapping.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/TUT_Lambda_step7.png)

An [event source mapping](../../../lambda/latest/dg/invocation-eventsourcemapping.md)
is a Lambda resource which reads items from a stream or queue and invokes a Lambda function. When you configure an event source
mapping, you can specify a batch size so that records from your stream or queue are batched together into a single payload.
In this example, you set the batch size to 1 so that your Lambda function is invoked every time you send a message to your queue.
You can configure the event source mapping using either the AWS CLI or the Lambda console.

###### To create an event source mapping (console)

1. Open the [Functions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home)
    page of the Lambda console and select your function
    ( `LambdaFunctionWithRDS`).

2. In the **Function overview** section, choose **Add**
**trigger**.

3. For the source, select **Amazon SQS**, then select the name of your
    queue ( `LambdaRDSQueue`).

4. For **Batch size**, enter `1`.

5. Leave all the other options set to the default values and choose
    **Add**.

You are now ready to test your complete setup by adding a message to your Amazon SQS queue.

## Test and monitor your setup

![Tutorial workflow diagram showing you are in the test and monitor step.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/TUT_Lambda_step8.png)

To test your complete setup, add messages to your Amazon SQS queue using the console. You then use CloudWatch Logs to
confirm that your Lambda function is writing records to your database as expected.

###### To test and monitor your setup

1. Open the [Queues](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs/v2/home) page of the Amazon SQS console
    and select your queue ( `LambdaRDSQueue`).

2. Choose **Send and receive messages** and paste the following JSON
    into the **Message body** in the **Send message**
    section.

```nohighlight

{
       "CustID": 1054,
       "Name": "Richard Roe"
}
```

3. Choose **Send message**.

Sending your message to the queue will cause Lambda to invoke your function through
    your event source mapping. To confirm that Lambda has invoked your function as expected,
    use CloudWatch Logs to verify that the function has written the customer name and ID to your
    database table.

4. Open the [Log\
    groups](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home) page of the CloudWatch console and select the log group for your function
    ( `/aws/lambda/LambdaFunctionWithRDS`).

5. In the **Log streams** section, choose the most recent log
    stream.

Your table should contain two customer records, one from each invocation of your function. In the log stream, you should see
    messages similar to the following:

```nohighlight

[INFO] 2023-02-14T19:06:43.873Z 45368126-3eee-47f7-88ca-3086ae6d3a77 The following items have been added to the database:
[INFO] 2023-02-14T19:06:43.873Z 45368126-3eee-47f7-88ca-3086ae6d3a77 (1021, 'Martha Rivera')
[INFO] 2023-02-14T19:06:43.873Z 45368126-3eee-47f7-88ca-3086ae6d3a77 (1054, 'Richard Roe')
```
