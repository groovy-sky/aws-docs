# Integrating an Amazon RDS for Db2 DB instance with Amazon S3

You can transfer files between your Amazon RDS for Db2 DB instance and an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket
with Amazon RDS stored procedures. For more information, see [Amazon RDS for Db2 stored procedure reference](db2-stored-procedures.md).

###### Note

Your DB instance and your Amazon S3 bucket must be in the same AWS Region.

For RDS for Db2 to integrate with Amazon S3, your DB instance must have access to an Amazon S3 bucket
where your RDS for Db2 resides. If you don't currently have an S3 bucket, [create a bucket](../../../s3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket-overview.md).

- [Step 2: Create an IAM role and attach your IAM policy](#db2-creating-iam-role)

- [Step 3: Add your IAM role to your RDS for Db2 DB instance](#db2-adding-iam-role)

## Step 1: Create an IAM policy

In this step, you create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy with the permissions required to
transfer files from your Amazon S3 bucket to your RDS DB instance. This step assumes that you have
already created an S3 bucket. For more information, see [Creating a\
bucket](../../../s3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Before you create the policy, note the following pieces of information:

- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your bucket

- The ARN for your AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key, if your bucket uses
SSE-KMS or SSE-S3 encryption.

The IAM policy that you create should contain the following information. Replace
`{amzn-s3-demo-bucket}` with the name of your S3
bucket.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowS3BucketAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:GenerateDataKey",
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                "s3:GetBucketAcl",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::${amzn-s3-demo-bucket}/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::${amzn-s3-demo-bucket}"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

You can create an IAM policy by using the AWS Management Console or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

###### To create an IAM policy to allow Amazon RDS to access your Amazon S3 bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Policies**.

3. Choose **Create policy**, and then choose
    **JSON**.

4. Add actions by service. To transfer files from an Amazon S3 bucket to
    Amazon RDS, you must select bucket permissions and object permissions.

5. Expand **Resources**. You must specify your bucket
    and object resources.

6. Choose **Next**.

7. For **Policy name**, enter a name for this policy.

8. (Optional) For **Description**, enter a description
    for this policy.

9. Choose **Create policy**.

###### To create an IAM policy to allow Amazon RDS to access your Amazon S3 bucket

1. Create a JSON file that contains the following JSON policy document.
    Replace `{amzn-s3-demo-bucket}` with the name
    of your S3 bucket.
JSON

```json

{
       "Version":"2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "AllowS3BucketAccess",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "kms:GenerateDataKey",
                   "kms:Decrypt",
                   "s3:PutObject",
                   "s3:GetObject",
                   "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                   "s3:ListBucket",
                   "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                   "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                   "s3:GetBucketAcl",
                   "s3:GetBucketLocation"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:s3:::${amzn-s3-demo-bucket}/*",
                   "arn:aws:s3:::${amzn-s3-demo-bucket}"
               ]
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "*"
               ]
           }
       ]
}

```

2. Run the [create-policy](../../../cli/latest/reference/iam/create-policy.md) command. In the following
    example, replace `iam_policy_name` and
    `iam_policy_file_name` with a name for your
    IAM policy and the name of the JSON file you created in Step 1.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws iam create-policy \
       --policy-name iam_policy_name \
       --policy-document '{
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
           {
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Action": [
               "kms:GenerateDataKey",
               "kms:Decrypt",
               "s3:PutObject",
               "s3:GetObject",
               "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
               "s3:ListBucket",
               "s3:DeleteObject",
               "s3:GetObjectVersion",
               "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
             ],
             "Resource": [
               "arn:aws:s3:::s3_bucket_name/*",
               "arn:aws:s3:::s3_bucket_name"
             ]
           }
         ]
       }'
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws iam create-policy ^
       --policy-name iam_policy_name ^
       --policy-document '{
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
           {
             "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                 "s3:PutObject",
                 "s3:GetObject",
                 "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                 "s3:ListBucket",
                 "s3:DeleteObject",
                 "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                 "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                 "arn:aws:s3:::s3_bucket_name/*",
                 "arn:aws:s3:::s3_bucket_name"
               ]
           }
         ]
       }'
```

3. After the policy is created, note the ARN of the policy. You need the
    ARN for [Step 2: Create an IAM role and attach your IAM policy](#db2-creating-iam-role).

For information about creating an IAM policy, see [Creating IAM\
policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-create.md) in the IAM User Guide.

## Step 2: Create an IAM role and attach your IAM policy

This step assumes that you have created the IAM policy in [Step 1: Create an IAM policy](#db2-creating-iam-policy). In this
step, you create a IAM role for your RDS for Db2 DB instance and then attach your IAM
policy to the role.

You can create an IAM role for your DB instance by using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.

###### To create an IAM role and attach your IAM policy to it

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**.

03. Choose **Create role**.

04. For **Trusted entity type**, select
     **AWS service**.

05. For **Service or use case**, select
     **RDS**, and then select **RDS** **–** **Add Role to**
    **Database**.

06. Choose **Next**.

07. For **Permissions policies**, search for and select
     the name of the IAM policy that you created.

08. Choose **Next**.

09. For **Role name**, enter a role name.

10. (Optional) For **Description**, enter a description
     for the new role.

11. Choose **Create role**.

###### To create an IAM role and attach your IAM policy to it

1. Create a JSON file that contains the following JSON policy
    document:
JSON

```json

{
       "Version":"2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "Service": "rds.amazonaws.com"
               },
               "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
           }
       ]
}

```

2. Run the [create-role](../../../cli/latest/reference/iam/create-role.md) command. In the following
    example, replace `iam_role_name` and
    `iam_assume_role_policy_file_name` with a
    name for your IAM role and the name of the JSON file that you created
    in Step 1.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws iam create-role \
       --role-name iam_role_name \
       --assume-role-policy-document '{
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
           {
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Principal": {
               "Service": "rds.amazonaws.com"
             },
             "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
           }
         ]
       }'
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws iam create-role ^
       --role-name iam_role_name ^
       --assume-role-policy-document '{
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
           {
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Principal": {
               "Service": "rds.amazonaws.com"
             },
             "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
           }
         ]
       }'
```

3. After the role is created, note the ARN of the role. You need the ARN
    for [Step 3: Add your IAM role to your RDS for Db2 DB instance](#db2-adding-iam-role).

4. Run the [attach-role-policy](../../../cli/latest/reference/iam/attach-role-policy.md) command. In the
    following example, replace `iam_policy_arn`
    with the ARN of the IAM policy that you created in [Step 1: Create an IAM policy](#db2-creating-iam-policy). Replace
    `iam_role_name` with the name of the IAM
    role that you just created.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws iam attach-role-policy \
      --policy-arn iam_policy_arn \
      --role-name iam_role_name
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws iam attach-role-policy ^
      --policy-arn iam_policy_arn ^
      --role-name iam_role_name
```

For more information, see [Creating a role to delegate\
permissions to an IAM user](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-user.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

## Step 3: Add your IAM role to your RDS for Db2 DB instance

In this step, you add your IAM role to your RDS for Db2 DB instance. Note the following
requirements:

- You must have access to an IAM role with the required Amazon S3 permissions
policy attached to it.

- You can only associate one IAM role with your RDS for Db2 DB instance at a
time.

- Your RDS for Db2 DB instance must be in the **Available**
state.

You can add an IAM role to your DB instance by using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.

###### To add an IAM role to your RDS for Db2 DB instance

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

3. Choose your RDS for Db2 DB instance name.

4. On the **Connectivity & security** tab, scroll
    down to the **Manage IAM roles** section at the
    bottom of the page.

5. For **Add IAM roles to this instance**, choose the
    role that you created in [Step 2: Create an IAM role and attach your IAM policy](#db2-creating-iam-role).

6. For **Feature**, choose
    **S3\_INTEGRATION**.

7. Choose **Add role**.

![The S3_INTEGRATION feature added to the IAM role for a DB instance.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/db2-s3-integration-role.png)

To add an IAM role to your RDS for Db2 DB instance, run the [add-role-to-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/add-role-to-db-instance.md) command. In the
following example, replace `region`,
`db_instance_name`, and
`iam_role_arn` with the name of the AWS Region
where your DB instance exists, the name of your DB instance, and the ARN of the
IAM role that you created in [Step 2: Create an IAM role and attach your IAM policy](#db2-creating-iam-role).

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds add-role-to-db-instance \
    --region $region \
    --db-instance-identifier $db_instance_name \
    --feature-name S3_INTEGRATION \
    --role-arn $iam_role_arn \
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds add-role-to-db-instance ^
    --region $region \
    --db-instance-identifier db_instance_name ^
    --feature-name S3_INTEGRATION ^
    --role-arn iam_role_arn ^
```

To confirm that the role was successfully added to your RDS for Db2 DB instance,
run the [describe-db-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.md) command. In the following
example, replace `db_instance_name` with the name of
your DB instance.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances \
    --filters "Name=db-instance-id,Values=db_instance_name" \
    --query 'DBInstances[].AssociatedRoles'
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances ^
    --filters "Name=db-instance-id,Values=db_instance_name" ^
    --query 'DBInstances[].AssociatedRoles'
```

This command produces output similar to the following example:

```nohighlight

[
    [
        {
            "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::0123456789012:role/rds-db2-s3-role",
            "FeatureName": "S3_INTEGRATION",
            "Status": "ACTIVE"
        }
    ]
]
```
