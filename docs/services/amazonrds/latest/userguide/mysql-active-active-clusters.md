# Configuring active-active clusters for RDS for MySQL

An active-active cluster in Amazon RDS is a database configuration where multiple nodes
actively handle read and write operations, distributing the workload across instances to
improve availability and scalability. Each node in the cluster is synchronized to maintain
data consistency, enabling high availability and faster failover in case of node
failure

You can set up an active-active cluster for RDS for MySQL by using the MySQL Group
Replication plugin. The Group Replication plugin is supported for RDS for MySQL DB instances
running the following versions:

- All MySQL 8.4 versions

- MySQL 8.0.35 and higher minor versions

For information about MySQL Group Replication, see [Group\
Replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-replication.html) in the MySQL documentation. The MySQL documentation contains
detailed information about this feature, while this topic describes how to configure and
manage the plugin on your RDS for MySQL DB instances.

###### Note

For the sake of brevity, all mentions of "active-active" cluster in this topic refer to
active-active clusters using the MySQL Group Replication plugin.

## Use cases for active-active clusters

The following cases are good candidates for using active-active clusters:

- Applications that need all of the DB instances in the cluster to support write
operations. The Group Replication plugin keeps the data consistent on each DB
instance in the active-active cluster. For more information about how this
works, see [Group Replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-replication-summary.html) in the MySQL documentation.

- Applications that require continuous availability of the database. With an
active-active cluster, the data is retained on the all of the DB instances in
the cluster. If one DB instance fails, the application can reroute traffic to
another DB instance in the cluster.

- Applications that might need to split read and write operations among
different DB instances in the cluster for load balancing purposes. With an
active-active cluster, your applications can send read traffic to specific DB
instances and write traffic to others. You can also switch which DB instances to
send reads or writes to at any time.
