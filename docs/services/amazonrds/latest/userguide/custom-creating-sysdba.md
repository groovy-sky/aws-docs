# Logging in to your RDS Custom for Oracle database as SYS

###### Note

End of support notice: On March 31, 2027, AWS will end support for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. After March 31, 2027, you will no longer be able to access the RDS Custom for Oracle console or RDS Custom for Oracle resources. For more information, see [RDS Custom for Oracle end of support](rds-custom-for-oracle-end-of-support.md).

After you create your RDS Custom DB instance, you can log in to your Oracle database as user
`SYS`, which gives you `SYSDBA` privileges. You have the following
login options:

- Get the `SYS` password from Secrets Manager, and specify this password in your
SQL client.

- Use OS authentication to log in to your database. In this case, you don't need a
password.

## Finding the SYS password for your RDS Custom for Oracle database

Your can log in to your Oracle database as `SYS` or `SYSTEM` or
by specifying the master user name in an API call. The password for `SYS` and
`SYSTEM` is stored in Secrets Manager.

The secret uses the naming format
`do-not-delete-rds-custom-resource_id-uuid`
or
`rds-custom!oracle-do-not-delete-resource_id-uuid`.
You can find the password using the AWS Management Console.

###### To find the SYS password for your database in Secrets Manager

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the RDS console, complete the following steps:
1. In the navigation pane, choose
       **Databases**.

2. Choose the name of your RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance.

3. Choose **Configuration**.

4. Copy the value underneath **Resource ID**.
       For example, you resource ID might be
       **db-ABC12CDE3FGH4I5JKLMNO6PQR7**.
3. Open the Secrets Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager).

4. In the Secrets Manager console, complete the following steps:
1. In the left navigation pane, choose
       **Secrets**.

2. Filter the secrets by the resource ID that you copied in step
       2.d.

3. Choose the secret that uses the naming format
       **do-not-delete-rds-custom- `resource_id`- `uuid`**
       or
       **rds-custom!oracle-do-not-delete- `resource_id`- `uuid`**.
       The `resource_id` is the resource ID
       that you copied in step 2.d.

      For example, if your resource ID is
       **db-ABC12CDE3FGH4I5JKLMNO6PQR7** and your
       UUID is **1234ab**, your secret is named
       **do-not-delete-rds-custom-db-ABC12CDE3FGH4I5JKLMNO6PQR7-1234ab**
       or
       **rds-custom!oracle-do-not-delete-db-ABC12CDE3FGH4I5JKLMNO6PQR7-1234ab**.

4. In **Secret value**, choose
       **Retrieve secret value**.

5. In **Key/value**, copy the value for
       **password**.
5. Install SQL\*Plus on your DB instance and log in to your database as
    `SYS`. For more information, see [Step 3: Connect your SQL client to an Oracle DB instance](chap-gettingstarted-creatingconnecting-oracle.md#CHAP_GettingStarted.Connecting.Oracle).

## Logging in to your RDS Custom for Oracle database using OS authentication

The OS user `rdsdb` owns the Oracle database binaries. You can switch to
the `rdsdb` user and log in to your RDS Custom for Oracle database without a
password.

1. Connect to your DB instance with AWS Systems Manager. For more information, see [Connecting to your RDS Custom DB instance using Session Manager](custom-creating-ssm.md).

2. Switch to the `rdsdb` user.

```

sudo su - rdsdb
```

3. Log in to your database using OS authentication. You can use `sqlplus / as sysdba` or the `sql` alias.

```

$ sqlplus / as sysdba

SQL*Plus: Release 21.0.0.0.0 - Production on Wed Apr 12 20:11:08 2023
