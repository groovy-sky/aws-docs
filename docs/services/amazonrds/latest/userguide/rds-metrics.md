# Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon RDS

Amazon CloudWatch metrics provide insights into the performance and health of Amazon RDS instances and
clusters, allowing you to monitor system behavior and make data-driven decisions. These
metrics help track resource utilization, database activity, and operational efficiency,
offering visibility into how your instances are performing.

This reference outlines the specific metrics available for Amazon RDS and explains how to
interpret and use them to optimize database performance, troubleshoot issues, and ensure
high availability.

Amazon RDS publishes metrics to Amazon CloudWatch in the `AWS/RDS` and `AWS/Usage` namespaces.

## Amazon CloudWatch instance-level metrics for Amazon RDS

The `AWS/RDS` namespace in Amazon CloudWatch includes the following instance-level metrics.

###### Note

The Amazon RDS console might display metrics in units that are different from the units sent to Amazon CloudWatch. For example, the Amazon RDS console
might display a metric in megabytes (MB), while the metric is sent to Amazon CloudWatch in bytes.

MetricDescriptionApplies toUnits

`BinLogDiskUsage`

The amount of disk space occupied by binary logs. If automatic backups are enabled for MySQL and MariaDB instances,
including read replicas, binary logs are created.

MariaDB

MySQL

Bytes

`BurstBalance`

The percent of General Purpose SSD (gp2) burst-bucket I/O credits available.

All

Percent

`CheckpointLag`

The amount of time since the most recent checkpoint.

Seconds

`ConnectionAttempts`

The number of attempts to connect to an instance, whether successful or not.

MySQL

Count

`CPUUtilization`

The percentage of CPU utilization.

All

Percent

`CPUCreditUsage`

The number of CPU credits spent by the instance for CPU
utilization. One CPU credit equals one vCPU running at 100 percent
utilization for one minute or an equivalent combination of vCPUs,
utilization, and time. For example, you might have one vCPU running at
50 percent utilization for two minutes or two vCPUs running at 25
percent utilization for two minutes.

This metric applies only to
`db.t2`, `db.t3`, and `db.t4g` instances.

###### Note

We recommend using the T DB instance classes only for development
and test servers, or other non-production servers. For more details
on the T instance classes, see [DB instance class types](concepts-dbinstanceclass-types.md)

CPU credit metrics are available at a five-minute frequency
only. If you specify a period greater than five minutes, use the
`Sum` statistic instead of the `Average`
statistic.

Credits (vCPU-minutes)

`CPUCreditBalance`

The number of earned CPU credits that an instance has accrued
since it was launched or started. For T2 Standard, the
`CPUCreditBalance` also includes the number of launch
credits that have been accrued.

Credits are accrued in the
credit balance after they are earned, and removed from the credit
balance when they are spent. The credit balance has a maximum limit,
determined by the instance size. After the limit is reached, any new
credits that are earned are discarded. For T2 Standard, launch credits
don't count towards the limit.

The credits in the
`CPUCreditBalance` are available for the instance to
spend to burst beyond its baseline CPU utilization.

When an
instance is running, credits in the `CPUCreditBalance` don't
expire. When the instance stops, the `CPUCreditBalance` does
not persist, and all accrued credits are lost.

CPU credit
metrics are available at a five-minute frequency only.

This metric
applies only to `db.t2`, `db.t3`, and
`db.t4g` instances.

###### Note

We recommend using the T DB instance classes only for development
and test servers, or other non-production servers. For more details
on the T instance classes, see [DB instance class types](concepts-dbinstanceclass-types.md)

Launch credits work the same way in Amazon RDS as they do in Amazon EC2.
For more information, see [Launch credits](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/burstable-performance-instances-standard-mode-concepts.md#launch-credits) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide for_
_Linux Instances_.

Credits (vCPU-minutes)

`CPUSurplusCreditBalance`

The number of surplus credits that have been spent by an unlimited instance
when its `CPUCreditBalance` value is zero.

The `CPUSurplusCreditBalance` value is paid down by earned CPU credits.
If the number of surplus credits exceeds the maximum number of credits that the
instance can earn in a 24-hour period, the spent surplus credits above the maximum
incur an additional charge.

CPU credit metrics are available at a 5-minute frequency only.

All

Credits (vCPU-minutes)

`CPUSurplusCreditsCharged`

The number of spent surplus credits that are not paid down by earned CPU credits,
and which thus incur an additional charge.

Spent surplus credits are charged when any of the following occurs:

- The spent surplus credits exceed the maximum number of credits that the instance can
earn in a 24-hour period. Spent surplus credits above the maximum are charged at the end of the hour.

- The instance is stopped or terminated.

- The instance is switched from `unlimited` to `standard`.

CPU credit metrics are available at a 5-minute frequency only.

All

Credits (vCPU-minutes)

`DatabaseConnections`

The number of client network connections to the database instance.

The number of database sessions can be higher than the metric value because the metric value doesn't include the
following:

- Sessions that no longer have a network connection but which the database hasn't cleaned up

- Sessions created by the database engine for its own purposes

- Sessions created by the database engine's parallel execution capabilities

- Sessions created by the database engine job scheduler

- Amazon RDS connections

access the disk.

To find the instance sizes that support this metric, see the instance sizes with an asterisk (\*) in the [EBS optimized by default](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ebs-optimized.md#current)
table in _Amazon EC2 User Guide_. The `Sum` statistic is not applicable to this
metric.
