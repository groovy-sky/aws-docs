# Analyzing database performance for a period of time

Analyze database performance with on-demand analysis by creating a performance analysis report for a period of time. View performance analysis reports to find
performance issues, such as resource bottlenecks or changes in a query in your DB instance.
The Performance Insights dashboard allows you to select a time period and create a performance analysis
report. You can also add one or more tags to the report.

To use this feature, you must be using the paid tier retention period. For more information, see
[Pricing and data retention for Performance Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.Overview.cost.html)

The report is available in the **Performance analysis reports - new** tab
to select and view. The report contains the insights, related metrics, and recommendations
to resolve the performance issue. The report is available to view for the duration of Performance Insights retention period.

The report is deleted if the start time of the report analysis period is outside of the
retention period. You can also delete the report before the retention period ends.

To detect the performance issues and generate the analysis report for your DB instance, you must turn on Performance Insights. For more information about
turning on Performance Insights, see [Turning Performance Insights on and off for Amazon RDS](user-perfinsights-enabling.md).
