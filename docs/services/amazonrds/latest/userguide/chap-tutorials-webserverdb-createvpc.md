# Tutorial: Create a VPC for use with a DB instance (IPv4 only)

A common scenario includes a DB instance in a virtual private cloud (VPC) based on the Amazon VPC
service. This VPC shares data with a web server that is running in the same VPC. In this
tutorial, you create the VPC for this scenario.

The following diagram shows this scenario. For information about other scenarios, see
[Scenarios for accessing a DB instance in a VPC](user-vpc-scenarios.md).

![Single VPC scenario](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/con-VPC-sec-grp.png)

Your DB instance needs to be available only to your web server, and not to the public
internet. Thus, you create a VPC with both public and private subnets. The web server is
hosted in the public subnet, so that it can reach the public internet. The DB instance is
hosted in a private subnet. The web server can connect to the DB instance
because it is hosted within the same VPC. But the DB instance isn't available to the
public internet, providing greater security.

This tutorial configures an additional public and private subnet in a separate
Availability Zone. These subnets aren't used by the tutorial. An RDS DB subnet group
requires a subnet in at least two Availability Zones. The
additional subnet makes it easier to switch to a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment in the
future.

This tutorial describes configuring a VPC for Amazon RDS DB instances.
For a tutorial that shows you how to create a web server for this VPC scenario, see
[Tutorial: Create a web server and an Amazon RDS DB instance](tut-webappwithrds.md). For more information about Amazon VPC, see
[Amazon VPC Getting Started Guide](../../../amazonvpc/latest/gettingstartedguide.md) and [Amazon VPC User Guide](../../../vpc/latest/userguide.md).

###### Tip

You can set up network connectivity between an Amazon EC2 instance and a DB
instance automatically
when you create the DB instance.
The network configuration is similar to the one described in this tutorial. For more information, see
[Configure automatic network connectivity with an EC2 instance](user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.Prerequisites.VPC.Automatic).

## Create a VPC with private and public subnets

Use the following procedure to create a VPC with both public and private subnets.

###### To create a VPC and subnets

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the top-right corner of the AWS Management Console, choose the Region
    to create your VPC in. This example uses the US West (Oregon) Region.

3. In the upper-left corner, choose **VPC dashboard**. To begin
    creating a VPC, choose **Create VPC**.

4. For **Resources to create** under **VPC settings**, choose
    **VPC and more**.

5. For the **VPC settings**, set these values:

- **Name tag auto-generation** – `tutorial`

- **IPv4 CIDR block** – `10.0.0.0/16`

- **IPv6 CIDR block** – **No IPv6 CIDR block**

- **Tenancy** – **Default**

- **Number of Availability Zones (AZs)** – **2**

- **Customize AZs** – Keep the default values.

- **Number of public subnet** – **2**

- **Number of private subnets** – **2**

- **Customize subnets CIDR blocks** – Keep the default values.

- **NAT gateways ($)** – **None**

- **VPC endpoints** – **None**

- **DNS options** – Keep the default values.

###### Note

Amazon RDS requires at least two subnets in two different Availability Zones to
support Multi-AZ DB instance deployments. This tutorial creates a Single-AZ
deployment, but the requirement makes it easier to convert to a Multi-AZ DB
instance deployment in the future.

6. Choose **Create VPC**.

## Create a VPC security group for a public web server

Next, you create a security group for public access. To connect to public EC2
instances in your VPC, you add inbound rules to your VPC security group. These allow
traffic to connect from the internet.

###### To create a VPC security group

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. Choose **VPC Dashboard**, choose **Security**
**Groups**, and then choose **Create security**
**group**.

3. On the **Create security group** page, set these values:

- **Security group name:** `tutorial-securitygroup`

- **Description:** `Tutorial Security Group`

- **VPC:** Choose the VPC that you created earlier, for
example: **vpc- `identifier` (tutorial-vpc)**

4. Add inbound rules to the security group.
1. Determine the IP address to use to connect to EC2 instances in your VPC using Secure Shell
       (SSH). To determine your public IP address, in a different browser window or tab,
       you can use the service at [https://checkip.amazonaws.com](https://checkip.amazonaws.com/).
       An example of an IP address is `203.0.113.25/32`.

      In many cases, you might connect through an internet service provider
       (ISP) or from behind your firewall without a static IP address. If so,
       find the range of IP addresses used by client computers.

      ###### Warning

      If you use `0.0.0.0/0` for SSH access, you make it
      possible for all IP addresses to access your public instances using
      SSH. This approach is acceptable for a short time in a test
      environment, but it's unsafe for production environments. In
      production, authorize only a specific IP address or range of
      addresses to access your instances using SSH.

2. In the **Inbound rules** section, choose **Add rule**.

3. Set the following values for your new inbound rule to allow SSH access
       to your Amazon EC2 instance. If you do this, you can connect to your Amazon EC2
       instance to install the web server and other utilities. You also connect
       to your EC2 instance to upload content for your web server.

- **Type:** `SSH`

- **Source:** The IP address or range from Step a, for
example: `203.0.113.25/32`.

4. Choose **Add rule**.

5. Set the following values for your new inbound rule to allow HTTP
       access to your web server:

- **Type:** `HTTP`

- **Source:** `0.0.0.0/0`
5. Choose **Create security group** to create the security
    group.

Note the security group ID because you need it later in this tutorial.

## Create a VPC security group for a private DB instance

To keep your DB instance private, create a second security group for
private access. To connect to private DB instances in your VPC, you add
inbound rules to your VPC security group that allow traffic from your web server
only.

###### To create a VPC security group

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. Choose **VPC Dashboard**, choose **Security**
**Groups**, and then choose **Create security**
**group**.

3. On the **Create security group** page, set these
    values:

- **Security group name:** `tutorial-db-securitygroup`

- **Description:** `Tutorial DB Instance Security Group`

- **VPC:** Choose the VPC that you created earlier, for
example: **vpc- `identifier` (tutorial-vpc)**

4. Add inbound rules to the security group.
1. In the **Inbound rules** section, choose **Add rule**.

2. Set the following values for your new inbound rule to allow MySQL
       traffic on port 3306 from your Amazon EC2 instance. If you do this, you can
       connect from your web server to your DB instance. By
       doing so, you can store and retrieve data from your web application to
       your database.

- **Type:** `MySQL/Aurora`

- **Source:** The identifier of the
**tutorial-securitygroup** security group that you created
previously in this tutorial, for example:
**sg-9edd5cfb**.
5. Choose **Create security group** to create the security
    group.

## Create a DB subnet group

A _DB subnet group_ is a collection of subnets that
you create in a VPC and that you then designate for your DB instances. A DB subnet group makes it possible for you to specify a particular
VPC when creating DB instances.

###### To create a DB subnet group

1. Identify the private subnets for your database in the VPC.
1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
       [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. Choose **VPC Dashboard**, and then choose **Subnets**.

3. Note the subnet IDs of the subnets named **tutorial-subnet-private1-us-west-2a**
       and **tutorial-subnet-private2-us-west-2b**.

      You need the subnet IDs when you create your DB subnet group.
2. Open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

Make sure that you connect to the Amazon RDS console, not to the Amazon VPC console.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Subnet groups**.

4. Choose **Create DB subnet group**.

5. On the **Create DB subnet group** page, set these values
    in **Subnet group details**:

- **Name:** `tutorial-db-subnet-group`

- **Description:** `Tutorial DB Subnet Group`

- **VPC:** **tutorial-vpc (vpc- `identifier`)**

6. In the **Add subnets** section, choose the **Availability Zones** and **Subnets**.

For this tutorial, choose **us-west-2a** and **us-west-2b** for the **Availability Zones**.
    For **Subnets**, choose the private subnets you identified in the previous step.

7. Choose **Create**.

Your new DB subnet group appears in the DB subnet groups list on the RDS
    console. You can choose the DB subnet group to see details in the details pane
    at the bottom of the window. These details include all of the subnets associated
    with the group.

###### Note

If you created this VPC to complete [Tutorial: Create a web server and an Amazon RDS DB instance](tut-webappwithrds.md),
create the DB instance
by following the instructions in [Create an Amazon RDS DB instance](chap-tutorials-webserverdb-createdbinstance.md).

## Deleting the VPC

After you create the VPC and other resources for this tutorial, you can delete them if they are no longer needed.

###### Note

If you added resources in the VPC that you created for this tutorial, you might
need to delete these before you can delete the VPC. For example, these resources
might include Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances. For more
information, see [Delete your\
VPC](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/working-with-vpcs.md#VPC_Deleting) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.
