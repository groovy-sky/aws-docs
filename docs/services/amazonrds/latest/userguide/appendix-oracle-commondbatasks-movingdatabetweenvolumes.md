# Moving data between storage volumes in RDS for Oracle

You can move data files and database objects between your primary and
additional storage volumes. Before you move data, consider the following points:

- The source and target volumes must have sufficient free space.

- Data movement operations consume I/O on both volumes.

- Large data movements can impact database performance.

- If you restore a snapshot, moving data between storage volumes might be slow
if it is affected by EBS lazy loading.

## Moving data files between volumes in RDS for Oracle

To move data files between storage volumes, use the Amazon RDS procedure
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.move_datafile`. Note the following
requirements:

- You must use Oracle Enterprise Edition to run the
`move_datafile` procedure.

- You can't move tablespace `SYSTEM` and
`RDSADMIN`.

The `move_datafile` procedure has the following parameters.

Parameter nameData typeRequiredDescription

`p_data_file_id`

number

Yes

The ID of the data file to be moved.

`p_location`

varchar2

Yes

The storage volume to which you want to move the data
file.

The following example moves a tablespace from the default volume
`rdsdbdata` to the additional volume `rdsdbdata2`.

```sql

SQL> SELECT tablespace_name,file_id,file_name FROM dba_data_files
 WHERE tablespace_name = 'MYNEWTABLESPACE';

TABLESPACE_NAME              FILE_ID FILE_NAME
------------------------- ---------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MYNEWTABLESPACE                    6 /rdsdbdata/db/ORCL_A/datafile/o1_mf_mynewtab_n123abcd_.dbf

EXECUTE rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.move_datafile( 6, 'rdsdbdata2');

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

SQL> SELECT tablespace_name,file_id,file_name FROM dba_data_files
  WHERE tablespace_name = 'MYNEWTABLESPACE';

TABLESPACE_NAME              FILE_ID FILE_NAME
------------------------- ---------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MYNEWTABLESPACE                    6 /rdsdbdata2/db/ORCL_A/datafile/o1_mf_mynewtab_n356efgh_.dbf
```

## Moving table data and indexes between volumes in RDS for Oracle

You can optimize database storage by creating tablespaces on additional
storage volumes. Then you can move objects such as tables, indexes, and partitions
to these tablespaces using standard Oracle SQL. This approach is valuable for
performance tuning when your database contains data with different access patterns.
For example, you could store frequently accessed operational data on
high-performance storage volumes while moving rarely accessed historical data to
lower-cost storage volumes.

In the following example, you create a new tablespace on high-performance
volume `rdsdbdata2`. Then you move a table to your additional storage
volume while the table is online. You also move the index to the same volume. Moving
tables and rebuilding indexes while online requires Oracle Enterprise
Edition.

```sql

ALTER SESSION SET db_create_file_dest = '/rdsdbdata2/db';
CREATE TABLESPACE perf_tbs DATAFILE SIZE 10G;

ALTER TABLE employees
  MOVE TABLESPACE perf_tbs ONLINE;

ALTER INDEX employees_idx
  REBUILD ONLINE TABLESPACE perf_tbs;
```

In the following example, you create a tablespace on a low-cost volume.
Then you move a table partition to your low-cost storage volume using an online
operation.

```sql

ALTER SESSION SET db_create_file_dest = '/rdsdbdata3/db';
CREATE TABLESPACE hist_tbs DATAFILE SIZE 10G;

ALTER TABLE orders
  MOVE PARTITION orders_2022
  TABLESPACE hist_tbs ONLINE;
```

In the following example, you query active sessions long
operations.

```sql

SELECT sid,opname,sofar,totalwork,time_remaining,elapsed_seconds
  FROM v$session_longops
  WHERE time_remaining > 0;
```

You can check your tablespaces usage with the following query.

```sql

SELECT tablespace_name, used_percent
  FROM dba_tablespace_usage_metrics
  ORDER BY used_percent DESC;
```

## Managing LOB storage using additional volumes

Your database might contains tables with BLOB or CLOB objects that consume
substantial storage but are infrequently accessed. To optimize storage, you can
relocate these LOB segments to a tablespace on an additional storage volume.

In the following example, you create a tablespace for LOB data on a
low-cost volume that is intended for low-access data. Then you create a table that
stores data on this volume.

```sql

ALTER SESSION SET db_create_file_dest = '/rdsdbdata3/db';
CREATE TABLESPACE lob_data DATAFILE SIZE 5G AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 1G;

CREATE TABLE documents (
    doc_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    doc_date DATE,
    doc_content CLOB
) TABLESPACE user_data
LOB(doc_content) STORE AS (TABLESPACE lob_data);
```
