# Performing common RMAN tasks for Oracle DB instances

In the following section, you can find how you can perform Oracle Recovery Manager
(RMAN) DBA tasks on your Amazon RDS DB instances running Oracle. To deliver a managed service
experience, Amazon RDS doesn't provide shell access to DB instances. It also restricts access to
certain system procedures and tables that require advanced privileges.

Use the Amazon RDS package `rdsadmin.rdsadmin_rman_util` to perform RMAN backups
of your Amazon RDS for Oracle database to disk. The `rdsadmin.rdsadmin_rman_util`
package supports full and incremental database file backups, tablespace backups, and
archived redo log backups.

After an RMAN backup has finished, you can copy the backup files off the Amazon RDS for Oracle DB instance host. You
might do this for the purpose of restoring to a non-RDS host or for long-term storage of backups. For example,
you can copy the backup files to an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see using [Amazon S3 integration](oracle-s3-integration.md).

The backup files for RMAN backups remain on the Amazon RDS DB instance host until you remove them
manually. You can use the `UTL_FILE.FREMOVE` Oracle procedure to remove files
from a directory. For more information, see [FREMOVE\
procedure](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ARPLS/u_file.htm) in the Oracle Database documentation.

You can't use the RMAN to restore RDS for Oracle DB instances. However, you can use RMAN to
restore a backup to an on-premises or Amazon EC2 instance. For more information, see the blog
article [Restore an Amazon RDS for Oracle instance to a self-managed\
instance](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/restore-an-amazon-rds-for-oracle-instance-to-a-self-managed-instance).

###### Note

For backing up and restoring to another Amazon RDS for Oracle DB instance, you can continue to
use the Amazon RDS backup and restore features. For more information, see [Backing up, restoring, and exporting data](chap-commontasks-backuprestore.md).
