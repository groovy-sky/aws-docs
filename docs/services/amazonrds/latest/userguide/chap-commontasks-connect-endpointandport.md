# Finding the connection information for an Amazon RDS DB instance

The connection information for a DB instance includes its endpoint, port, and a valid
database user, such as the master user. For example, for a MySQL DB instance, suppose
that the endpoint value is `mydb.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`.
In this case, the port value is `3306`, and the database user is
`admin`. Given this information, you specify the following values in a
connection string:

- For host or host name or DNS name, specify
`mydb.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`.

- For port, specify `3306`.

- For user, specify `admin`.

The endpoint is unique for each DB instance, and the values of the port and user can
vary. The following list shows the most common port for each DB engine:

- Db2 – 50000

- MariaDB – 3306

- Microsoft SQL Server – 1433

- MySQL – 3306

- Oracle – 1521

- PostgreSQL – 5432

To connect to a DB instance, use any client for a DB engine. For example, you might
use the mysql utility to connect to a MariaDB or MySQL DB instance. You might use
Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to connect to a SQL Server DB instance. You might
use Oracle SQL Developer to connect to an Oracle DB instance. Similarly, you might use
the psql command line utility to connect to a PostgreSQL DB instance.

To find the connection information for a DB instance, use the AWS Management Console. You can also
use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) [describe-db-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.md) command or the RDS API [DescribeDBInstances](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbinstances.md)
operation.

###### To find the connection information for a DB instance in the AWS Management Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases** to display a list of your DB instances.

3. Choose the name of the DB instance to display its details.

4. On the **Connectivity & security** tab, copy the endpoint.
    Also, note the port number. You need both the endpoint and the port number
    to connect to the DB instance.

5. If you need to find the master user name, choose the
    **Configuration** tab and view the **Master**
**username** value.

To find the connection information for a DB instance by using the AWS CLI, call the
[describe-db-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.md) command. In the call, query for the DB
instance ID, endpoint, port, and master user name.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances \
  --query "*[].[DBInstanceIdentifier,Endpoint.Address,Endpoint.Port,MasterUsername]"
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances ^
  --query "*[].[DBInstanceIdentifier,Endpoint.Address,Endpoint.Port,MasterUsername]"
```

Your output should be similar to the following.

```nohighlight

[
    [
        "mydb",
        "mydb.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
        3306,
        "admin"
    ],
    [
        "myoracledb",
        "myoracledb.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
        1521,
        "dbadmin"
    ],
    [
        "mypostgresqldb",
        "mypostgresqldb.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
        5432,
        "postgresadmin"
    ]
]
```

To find the connection information for a DB instance by using the Amazon RDS API, call
the [DescribeDBInstances](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbinstances.md) operation. In the output, find the values for
the endpoint address, endpoint port, and master user name.
