# OS metrics in Enhanced Monitoring

Amazon RDS
provides metrics in real time for the operating system (OS) that your DB instance runs on.
RDS delivers
the metrics from Enhanced Monitoring to your Amazon CloudWatch Logs account. The following tables list the OS
metrics available using Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
