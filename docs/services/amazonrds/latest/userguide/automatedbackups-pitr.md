# Restoring to a specified time from a replicated backup for Amazon RDS

You can restore a DB instance to a specific point in time from a replicated backup using the Amazon RDS console. You can also use
the `restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time` AWS CLI command or the `RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime` RDS API
operation.

For general information on point-in-time recovery (PITR), see [Restoring a DB instance to a specified time for Amazon RDS](user-pit.md).

###### Note

Note the following DB engine restrictions when automated backups are replicated across
AWS Regions:

- On RDS for SQL Server, option groups aren't copied.

- On RDS for Oracle, the following options aren't copied:
`NATIVE_NETWORK_ENCRYPTION`, `OEM`,
`OEM_AGENT`, and `SSL`.

If you've associated a custom option group with your DB instance, you can
re-create that option group in the destination Region. Then restore the DB instance
in the destination Region and associate the custom option group with it. For more
information, see [Working with option groups](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md).

###### To restore a DB instance to a specified time from a replicated backup

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose the destination Region (where backups are replicated to) from the Region selector.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Automated backups**.

4. On the **Replicated backups** tab, choose the DB instance that you want to restore.

5. For **Actions**, choose **Restore to point in time**.

6. Choose **Latest restorable time** to restore to the latest possible time, or choose
    **Custom** to choose a time.

If you chose **Custom**, enter the date and time that you want to restore the instance to.

###### Note

Times are shown in your local time zone, which is indicated by an offset from Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC). For example, UTC-5 is Eastern Standard Time/Central Daylight Time.

7. For **DB instance identifier**, enter the name of the target restored DB instance.

8. (Optional) Choose other options as needed, such as enabling autoscaling.

9. Choose **Restore to point in time**.

Use the [`restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time.html) AWS CLI command
to create a new DB instance.

###### To restore a DB instance to a specified time from a replicated backup

- Run one of the following commands.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time \
      --source-db-instance-automated-backups-arn "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:auto-backup:ab-L2IJCEXJP7XQ7HOJ4SIEXAMPLE" \
      --target-db-instance-identifier mytargetdbinstance \
      --restore-time 2020-10-14T23:45:00.000Z
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time ^
      --source-db-instance-automated-backups-arn "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:auto-backup:ab-L2IJCEXJP7XQ7HOJ4SIEXAMPLE" ^
      --target-db-instance-identifier mytargetdbinstance ^
      --restore-time 2020-10-14T23:45:00.000Z
```

To restore a DB instance to a specified time, call the
[`RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime`](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-restoredbinstancetopointintime.md)
Amazon RDS API operation with the following parameters:

- `SourceDBInstanceAutomatedBackupsArn`

- `TargetDBInstanceIdentifier`

- `RestoreTime`
