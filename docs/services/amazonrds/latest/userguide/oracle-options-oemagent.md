# Oracle Management Agent for Enterprise Manager Cloud Control

Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) Management Agent is a software component that monitors
targets running on hosts and communicates that information to the middle-tier Oracle
Management Service (OMS). Amazon RDS supports Management Agent through the use of the
`OEM_AGENT` option.

For more information, see [Overview of Oracle\
Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24628_01/doc.121/e25353/overview.htm) and [Overview of Oracle\
Enterprise Manager cloud control 13c](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E63000_01/EMCON/overview.htm) in the Oracle documentation.

## Requirements for Management Agent

Following are general requirements for using Management Agent:

- You can use either the CDB
or non-CDB architecture.

- You must use an Oracle Management Service (OMS) that is configured to connect
to your DB instance. Note the following OMS requirements:

- Management Agent version 24.1.0.0.v1 requires OMS version
24.1.

- Management Agent versions 13.5.0.0.v2 and 13.5.0.0.v3 require OMS
version 13.5.0.23 or 24.1.

- Management Agent version 13.5.0.0.v1 requires OMS version 13.5.0.0 or
24.1.

- Management Agent versions 13.4.0.9.v1 and 13.4.0.9.v2 require OMS
version 13.4.0.9 or later and patch 32198287.

- In most cases, you must configure your VPC to allow connections from OMS to
your DB instance. If you aren't familiar with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), we recommend that you
complete the steps in [Tutorial: Create a VPC for use with a DB instance (IPv4 only)](chap-tutorials-webserverdb-createvpc.md) before continuing.

- You can use Management Agent with Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control for
12c and 13c. Ensure that you have sufficient storage space for your OEM
release:

- At least 8.5 GiB for OEM 24ai Release 1

- At least 8.5 GiB for OEM 13c Release 5

- At least 8.5 GiB for OEM 13c Release 4

- At least 8.5 GiB for OEM 13c Release 3

- At least 5.5 GiB for OEM 13c Release 2

- At least 4.5 GiB for OEM 13c Release 1

- At least 2.5 GiB for OEM 12c

- If you're using Management Agent versions `OEM_AGENT 13.2.0.0.v3`
and `13.3.0.0.v2`, and if you want to use TCPS connectivity, follow
the instructions in [Configuring third party CA certificates for communication with target\
databases](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E73210_01/EMSEC/GUID-8337AD48-1A32-4CD5-84F3-256FAE93D043.htm) in the Oracle documentation. Also, update the JDK on your
OMS by following the instructions in the Oracle document with the Oracle Doc ID
2241358.1. This step ensures that OMS supports all the cipher suites that the
database supports.

###### Note

TCPS connectivity between the Management Agent and the DB instance is supported
for Management Agent `OEM_AGENT 13.2.0.0.v3`,
`13.3.0.0.v2`, `13.4.0.9.v1`, and higher
versions.

## OMS host communication prerequisites

Make sure that your OMS host and your Amazon RDS DB instance can communicate. Do the following:

- To connect from the Management Agent to your OMS host when your OMS host is
behind a firewall, add the IP addresses of your DB instances to the firewall. Make
sure the firewall for the OMS allows the following network traffic:

_From the OMS host to your DB instance_

Configure a one-way firewall rule that allows traffic from the OMS
host to the database listener port (default 1521) and the OEM Agent
port (default 3872).

From your DB instance to the OMS host

Configure a one-way firewall rule that allows traffic from the
DB instance to the OMS HTTP port (default 4903).

- To connect from your OMS to the Management Agent, if your OMS has a publicly
resolvable host name, add the OMS address to a security group. Your security
group must have inbound rules that allow access to the DB listener port and the
Management Agent port. For an example of creating a security and adding inbound
rules, see [Tutorial: Create a VPC for use with a DB instance (IPv4 only)](chap-tutorials-webserverdb-createvpc.md).

- To connect from your OMS to the Management Agent, if your OMS doesn't have a
publicly resolvable host name, use one of the following:

- If your OMS is hosted on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance in a private
VPC, you can set up VPC peering to connect from OMS to Management Agent.
For more information, see [A DB instance in a VPC accessed by an EC2 instance in a different VPC](user-vpc-scenarios.md#USER_VPC.Scenario3).

- If your OMS is hosted on-premises, you can set up a VPN connection to
allow access from OMS to Management Agent. For more information, see
[A DB instance in a VPC accessed by a client application through the internet](user-vpc-scenarios.md#USER_VPC.Scenario4) or [VPN connections](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpn-connections.html).

- To connect OEM Management Agent version 13.5.0.0 (v1-v3) or 24.1.0.0.v1
to a 24.1 OMS host, set `MINIMUM_TLS_VERSION` to use the TLS 1.2
protocol `TLSv1.2` in your configuration options.

## Limitations for Management Agent

Following are some limitations to using Management Agent:

- You can't provide custom Oracle Management Agent images.

- Administrative tasks such as job execution and database patching, that require
host credentials, aren't supported.

- Host metrics and the process list aren't guaranteed to reflect the actual
system state. Thus, you shouldn't use OEM to monitor the root file system or
mount point file system. For more information about monitoring the operating
system, see [Monitoring OS metrics with Enhanced Monitoring](user-monitoring-os.md).

- Autodiscovery isn't supported. You must manually add database targets.

- OMS module availability depends on your database edition. For example, the
database performance diagnosis and tuning module is only available for Oracle
Database Enterprise Edition.

- Management Agent consumes additional memory and computing resources. If you
experience performance problems after enabling the `OEM_AGENT`
option, we recommend that you scale up to a larger DB instance class. For more
information, see [DB instance classes](concepts-dbinstanceclass.md) and [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

- The user running the `OEM_AGENT` on the Amazon RDS host doesn't have
operating system access to the alert log. Thus, you can't collect metrics for
`DB Alert Log` and `DB Alert Log Error Status` in
OEM.

## Option settings for Management Agent

Amazon RDS supports the following settings for the Management Agent option.

### Certificate compatibility with cipher suites

RDS for Oracle supports both RSA and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
certificates. When you configure the OEM Agent option for your DB instance, you must
ensure that the cipher suites you specify in the `TLS_CIPHER_SUITE`
option setting are compatible with the certificate type used by your DB instance.

The following table shows the compatibility between certificate types and cipher suites:

Certificate typeCompatible cipher suitesIncompatible cipher suitesRSA certificates (rds-ca-2019, rds-ca-rsa2048-g1, rds-ca-rsa4096-g1)

TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA384

When you specify a cipher suite in the `TLS_CIPHER_SUITE` option setting, make sure it is compatible with the certificate type used by your DB instance. If you attempt to associate an option group with an OEM Agent option that contains a cipher suite incompatible with the certificate type of a DB instance, the operation will fail with an error message indicating the incompatibility.

## Enabling the Management Agent option for your DB instance

To enable the Management Agent option, use the following steps:

###### Topics

- [Step 1: Adding the Management Agent option to your DB instance](#Oracle.Options.OEMAgent.Add)

- [Step 2: Unlocking the DBSNMP user account](#Oracle.Options.OEMAgent.DBSNMP)

- [Step 3: Adding your targets to the Management Agent console](#Oracle.Options.OEMAgent.Using)

### Step 1: Adding the Management Agent option to your DB instance

To add the Management Agent option to your DB instance, do the following:

1. Create a new option group, or copy or modify an existing option
    group.

2. Add the option to the option group.

3. Associate the option group with the DB instance.

If you encounter errors, check [My Oracle\
Support](https://support.oracle.com/) documents for information about resolving specific
problems.

After you add the Management Agent option, you don't need to restart your DB instance.
As soon as the option group is active, the OEM Agent is active.

If your OMS host is using an untrusted third-party certificate, Amazon RDS returns the
following error.

```nohighlight

You successfully installed the OEM_AGENT option. Your OMS host is using an untrusted third party certificate.
Configure your OMS host with the trusted certificates from your third party.
```

If this error is returned, the Management Agent option isn't enabled until
the problem is corrected. For information about correcting the problem, see the My
Oracle Support document [2202569.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocContentDisplay?id=2202569.1).

###### To add the Management Agent option to your DB instance

1. Determine the option group you want to use. You can create a new
    option group or use an existing option group. If you want to use an
    existing option group, skip to the next step. Otherwise, create a
    custom DB option group with the following settings:

1. For **Engine** choose the oracle edition
       for your DB instance.

2. For **Major engine version** choose the
       version of your DB instance.

For more information, see [Creating an option group](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Create).

2. Add the **OEM\_AGENT** option to the option group,
    and configure the option settings. For more information about adding
    options, see [Adding an option to an option group](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.AddOption). For
    more information about each setting, see [Option settings for Management Agent](#Oracle.Options.OEMAgent.Options).

3. Apply the option group to a new or existing DB instance:

- For a new DB instance, you apply the option group when you
launch the instance. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md).

- For an existing DB instance, you apply the option group by
modifying the instance and attaching the new option group.
For more information, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

The following example uses the AWS CLI [add-option-to-option-group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/add-option-to-option-group.html) command to add the
`OEM_AGENT` option to an option group called
`myoptiongroup`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds add-option-to-option-group \
    --option-group-name "myoptiongroup" \
    --options OptionName=OEM_AGENT,OptionVersion=13.1.0.0.v1,Port=3872,VpcSecurityGroupMemberships=sg-1234567890,OptionSettings=[{Name=OMS_HOST,Value=my.example.oms},{Name=OMS_PORT,Value=4903},{Name=AGENT_REGISTRATION_PASSWORD,Value=password}] \
    --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds add-option-to-option-group ^
    --option-group-name "myoptiongroup" ^
    --options OptionName=OEM_AGENT,OptionVersion=13.1.0.0.v1,Port=3872,VpcSecurityGroupMemberships=sg-1234567890,OptionSettings=[{Name=OMS_HOST,Value=my.example.oms},{Name=OMS_PORT,Value=4903},{Name=AGENT_REGISTRATION_PASSWORD,Value=password}] ^
    --apply-immediately
```

### Step 2: Unlocking the DBSNMP user account

The Management Agent uses the `DBSNMP` user account to connect to the database and report issues to Oracle Enterprise Manager. In a CDB, `DBSNMP` is a common user. This user account is necessary for both the Management Agent and OEM Database Express. By default, this account is locked. The procedure for unlocking this account
differs depending on whether your database uses the non-CDB or CDB
architecture.

###### To unlock the DBSNMP user account

1. In SQL\*Plus or another Oracle SQL application, log in to your DB instance
    as your master user.

2. Do either of the following actions, depending on the database
    architecture:

**Your database is a non-CDB.**

Run the following SQL statement:

```sql

ALTER USER dbsnmp IDENTIFIED BY new_password ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
```

**Your database is a CDB.**

Run the following stored procedure to unlock the
`DBSNMP` account:

```sql

EXEC rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.reset_oem_agent_password('new_password');
```

If you receive an error stating that the procedure doesn't
exist, reboot your CDB instance to install it automatically. For
more information, see [Rebooting a DB instance](user-rebootinstance.md).

### Step 3: Adding your targets to the Management Agent console

To add a DB instance as a target, make sure you know the endpoint and port. For
information about finding the endpoint for your Amazon RDS DB instance, see [Finding the endpoint of your RDS for Oracle DB instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Endpoint.html). If your database uses
the CDB architecture, then add the `CDB$ROOT` container separately as a
target.

###### To add targets to the Management Agent console

1. In your OMS console, choose **Setup**, **Add**
**Target**, **Add Targets Manually**.

2. Choose **Add Targets Declaratively by Specifying Target Monitoring**
**Properties**.

3. For **Target Type**, choose **Database**
**Instance**.

4. For **Monitoring Agent**, choose the agent with the
    identifier that is the same as your RDS DB instance identifier.

5. Choose **Add Manually**.

6. Enter the endpoint for your Amazon RDS DB instance, or choose it from the host name
    list. Make sure that the specified host name matches the endpoint of the
    Amazon RDS DB instance.

7. Specify the following database properties:

- For **Target name**, enter a name.

- For **Database system name**, enter a
name.

- For **Monitor username**, enter
`dbsnmp`.

- For **Monitor password**, enter the password from
[Step 2: Unlocking the DBSNMP user account](#Oracle.Options.OEMAgent.DBSNMP).

- For **Role**, enter **normal**.

- For **Oracle home path**, enter
`/oracle`.

- For **Listener Machine name**, the agent
identifier already appears.

- For **Port**, enter the database port. The RDS
default port is 1521.

- For **Database name**, enter the name of your
database. If your database is a CDB, this name is
`RDSCDB`.

8. Choose **Test Connection**.

9. Choose **Next**. The target database appears in your list
    of monitored resources.

## Removing the Management Agent option

You can remove the OEM Agent from a DB instance. After you remove the OEM Agent, you don't
need to restart your DB instance.

To remove the OEM Agent from a DB instance, do one of the following:

- Remove the OEM Agent option from the option group it belongs to. This change
affects all DB instances that use the option group. For more information, see
[Removing an option from an option group](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.RemoveOption).

- Modify the DB instance and specify a different option group that doesn't include the
OEM Agent option. This change affects a single DB instance. You can specify the
default (empty) option group, or a different custom option group. For more
information, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

## Performing database tasks with the Management Agent

You can use Amazon RDS procedures to run certain EMCTL commands on the Management Agent. By
running these procedures, you can do the tasks listed following.

### Viewing the status of an ongoing task

You can view the status of an ongoing task in a bdump file. The bdump files are
located in the `/rdsdbdata/log/trace` directory. Each bdump file
name is in the following format.

```nohighlight

dbtask-task-id.log
```

When you want to monitor a task, replace
`task-id` with the ID of the task that you
want to monitor.

To view the contents of bdump files, run the Amazon RDS procedure
`rdsadmin.rds_file_util.read_text_file`. The following query returns
the contents of the `dbtask-1546988886389-2444.log` bdump file.

```sql

SELECT text FROM table(rdsadmin.rds_file_util.read_text_file('BDUMP','dbtask-1546988886389-2444.log'));
```
