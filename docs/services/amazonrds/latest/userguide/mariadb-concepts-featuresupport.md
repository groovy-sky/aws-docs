### MariaDB 11.8 support on Amazon RDS

Amazon RDS supports the following new features for your DB instances running MariaDB version 11.8 or higher.

###### Note

In MariaDB 11.8, the default value for `require_secure_transport` is now `1`, requiring secure SSL/TLS connections. Set to `0` if non-secure connections are needed.

- **New default value for parameter** – The default value of `require_secure_transport` parameter changed from `0` to `1`, enforcing secure transport connections by default.
For more information, see [Requiring SSL/TLS for all connections to a MariaDB DB instance on Amazon RDS](mariadb-ssl-connections-require-ssl.md).

- **Vector support** – You can use the MariaDB Vector to store and search AI-generated vectors directly in MariaDB.
This feature introduces the following system variables:

- The variable [`mhnsw_default_distance`](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/reference/sql-structure/vectors/vector-system-variables) specifies the default distance metric for MHNSW vector indexing.

- The variable [`mhnsw_default_m`](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/reference/sql-structure/vectors/vector-system-variables) defines the default value for the `M` parameter in MHNSW vector indexing.

- The variable [`mhnsw_ef_search`](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/reference/sql-structure/vectors/vector-system-variables) defines the minimal number of result candidates for vector index searches.

- The variable [`mhnsw_max_cache_size`](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/reference/sql-structure/vectors/vector-system-variables) sets the upper limit for one MHNSW vector index cache.

- **Temporary file size limits** – You can now limit the size of created disk temporary files and tables using two system variables available in the RDS Maria DB 11.8 parameter group:

- The variable [`max_tmp_session_space_usage`](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/security/limiting-size-of-created-disk-temporary-files-and-tables/max_tmp_session_space_usage-system-variable) limits the temporary space allowance per user.

- The variable [`max_tmp_total_space_usage\
                          `](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/security/limiting-size-of-created-disk-temporary-files-and-tables/max_tmp_total_space_usage-system-variable) limits the temporary space allowance for all users.

- **Temporary tablespace management** – The temporary tablespace stores temporary tables and grows as data is added. When temporary tables are dropped,
the space is not automatically reclaimed. You can use the [mysql.rds\_execute\_operation](mysql-rds-execute-operation.md) procedure
to shrink the temporary tablespace and reclaim disk space.

For a list of all MariaDB 11.8 features and their documentation, see [Changes and improvements in MariaDB 11.8](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-11-8) and [Release notes - MariaDB 11.8 series](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/release-notes-mariadb-11-8-series) on the MariaDB website.

from all users, even users that previously had SUPER privileges.

- **Security** – You can now set option
`--ssl` as the default for your MariaDB client. MariaDB no
longer silently disables SSL if the configuration is incorrect.

- **SQL commands and functions** – You
can now use the `SHOW ANALYZE FORMAT=JSON` command and the functions
`ROW_NUMBER`, `SFORMAT`, and `RANDOM_BYTES`.
`SFORMAT` allows string formatting and is enabled by default.
You can convert partition to table and table to partition in a single
command. There are also several improvements around `JSON_*()`
functions. `DES_ENCRYPT` and `DES_DECRYPT` functions
were deprecated for version 10.10 and higher. For more information, see
[SFORMAT](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/sformat).

- **InnoDB enhancements** – These
enhancements include the following items:

- Performance improvements in the redo log to reduce write
amplification and to improve concurrency.

- The ability for you to change the undo tablespace without
reinitializing the data directory. This enhancement reduces control
plane overhead. It requires restarting but it doesn't require
reinitialization after changing undo tablespace.

- Support for `CHECK TABLE … EXTENDED` and for descending
indexes internally.

- Improvements to bulk insert.

- **Binlog changes** – These changes
include the following items:

- Logging `ALTER` in two phases to decrease replication
latency. The `binlog_alter_two_phase` parameter is
disabled by default, but can be enabled through parameter
groups.

- Logging `explicit_defaults_for_timestamp`.

- No longer logging `INCIDENT_EVENT` if the transaction can be
safely rolled back.

- **Replication** **improvement** s – MariaDB version 10.11
DB instances use GTID replication by default if the master supports it. Also,
`Seconds_Behind_Master` is more precise.

- **Clients** – You can use new
command-line options for `mysqlbinglog` and
`mariadb-dump`. You can use `mariadb-dump` to dump
and restore historical data.

- **System versioning**– You can modify
history. MariaDB automatically creates new partitions.

- **Atomic DDL** – `CREATE OR
                              REPLACE` is now atomic. Either the statement succeeds or it's
completely reversed.

### MariaDB 10.6 support on Amazon RDS

Amazon RDS supports the following new features for your DB instances running MariaDB
version 10.6 or higher:

- **MyRocks storage engine** –
You can use the MyRocks storage engine with RDS for MariaDB to optimize storage consumption
of your write-intensive, high-performance web applications. For more information, see
[Supported storage engines for MariaDB on Amazon RDS](mariadb-concepts-storage.md) and
[MyRocks](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/myrocks).

- **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) DB authentication** –
You can use IAM DB authentication for better security and central management of connections to
your MariaDB DB instances. For more information, see
[IAM database authentication for MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL](usingwithrds-iamdbauth.md).

- **Upgrade options** – You can now
upgrade to RDS for MariaDB version 10.6 from any prior major release (10.3, 10.4,
10.5). You can also restore a snapshot of an existing MySQL 5.6 or 5.7 DB
instance to a MariaDB 10.6 instance. For more information, see [Upgrades of the MariaDB DB engine](user-upgradedbinstance-mariadb.md).

- **Delayed replication** – You can now set a configurable time period
for which a read replica lags behind the source database. In a standard MariaDB replication configuration,
there is minimal replication delay between the source and the replica. With delayed replication, you can set an
intentional delay as a strategy for disaster recovery. For more information, see
[Configuring delayed replication with MariaDB](user-mariadb-replication-readreplicas-delayreplication.md).

- **Oracle PL/SQL compatibility** – By
using RDS for MariaDB version 10.6, you can more easily migrate your legacy
Oracle applications to Amazon RDS. For more information, see [SQL\_MODE=ORACLE](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/sql_modeoracle).

- **Atomic DDL** – Your dynamic data
language (DDL) statements can be relatively crash-safe with RDS for MariaDB
version 10.6. `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`,
`RENAME TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `DROP
                              DATABASE` and related DDL statements are now atomic. Either the
statement succeeds, or it's completely reversed. For more information, see
[Atomic\
DDL](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/atomic-ddl).

- **Other enhancements** – These
enhancements include a `JSON_TABLE` function for transforming
JSON data to relational format within SQL, and faster empty table data load
with Innodb. They also include new `sys_schema` for analysis and
troubleshooting, optimizer enhancement for ignoring unused indexes, and
performance improvements. For more information, see [JSON\_TABLE](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/json_table).

- **New default values for parameters** – The following parameters have
new default values for MariaDB version 10.6 DB instances:

- The default value for the following parameters has changed from `utf8` to `utf8mb3`:

- [character\_set\_client](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables)

- [character\_set\_connection](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables)

- [character\_set\_results](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables)

- [character\_set\_system](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables)

Although the default values have changed for these parameters, there is no functional change. For more information,
see [Supported Character Sets and Collations](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/supported-character-sets-and-collations)
in the MariaDB documentation.

- The default value of the [collation\_connection](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables) parameter has changed from `utf8_general_ci` to `utf8mb3_general_ci`.
Although the default value has changed for this parameter, there is no functional change.

- The default value of the [old\_mode](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables) parameter has changed from unset to `UTF8_IS_UTF8MB3`. Although the default value
has changed for this parameter, there is no functional change.

For a list of all MariaDB 10.6 features and their documentation, see
[Changes and improvements in MariaDB 10.6](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-106)
and [Release notes - MariaDB 10.6 series](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/release-notes-mariadb-106-series)
on the MariaDB website.

For a list of unsupported features, see [MariaDB features not supported by Amazon RDS](mariadb-concepts-featurenonsupport.md).

### MariaDB 10.5 support on Amazon RDS

Amazon RDS supports the following new features for your DB instances
running MariaDB version 10.5 or later:

- **InnoDB enhancements** –
MariaDB version 10.5 includes InnoDB enhancements. For more information, see
[InnoDB: Performance Improvements etc.](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-105) in the MariaDB documentation.

- **Performance schema updates** –
MariaDB version 10.5 includes performance schema updates. For more
information, see [Performance Schema Updates to Match MySQL 5.7 Instrumentation and\
Tables](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-105) in the MariaDB documentation.

- **One file in the InnoDB redo log** –
In versions of MariaDB before version 10.5, the value of the
`innodb_log_files_in_group` parameter was set to
`2`. In MariaDB version 10.5, the value of this parameter is
set to `1`.

If you are upgrading from a prior version to MariaDB version 10.5, and you
don't modify the parameters, the `innodb_log_file_size`
parameter value is unchanged. However, it applies to one log file instead of
two. The result is that your upgraded MariaDB version 10.5 DB instance uses
half of the redo log size that it was using before the upgrade. This change
can have a noticeable performance impact. To address this issue, you can
double the value of the `innodb_log_file_size` parameter. For
information about modifying parameters, see [Modifying parameters in a DB parameter group in Amazon RDS](user-workingwithparamgroups-modifying.md).

- **SHOW SLAVE STATUS command not**
**supported** – In versions of MariaDB before version
10.5, the `SHOW SLAVE STATUS` command required the
`REPLICATION SLAVE` privilege. In MariaDB version 10.5, the
equivalent `SHOW REPLICA STATUS` command requires the `REPLICATION REPLICA ADMIN` privilege. This
new privilege isn't granted to the RDS master user.

Instead of using the `SHOW REPLICA STATUS` command, run the new `mysql.rds_replica_status` stored procedure
to return similar information. For more information, see [mysql.rds\_replica\_status](mysql-rds-replica-status.md).

- **SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS command not**
**supported** – In versions of MariaDB before version
10.5, the `SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS` command required the
`REPLICATION SLAVE` privilege. In MariaDB version 10.5, this
command requires the `REPLICATION REPLICA ADMIN` privilege. This
new privilege isn't granted to the RDS master user.

- **New default values for parameters** – The following parameters have
new default values for MariaDB version 10.5 DB instances:

- The default value of the [max\_connections](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables)
parameter has changed to `LEAST({DBInstanceClassMemory/25165760},12000)`. For information about the `LEAST` parameter function,
see [DB parameter functions](user-paramvaluesref.md#USER_ParamFunctions).

- The default value of the [innodb\_adaptive\_hash\_index](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/innodb-system-variables) parameter has changed to `OFF` ( `0`).

- The default value of the [innodb\_checksum\_algorithm](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/innodb-system-variables) parameter has changed to `full_crc32`.

- The default value of the [innodb\_log\_file\_size](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/innodb-system-variables)
parameter has changed to 2 GB.

For a list of all MariaDB 10.5 features and their documentation, see
[Changes and improvements in MariaDB 10.5](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-105)
