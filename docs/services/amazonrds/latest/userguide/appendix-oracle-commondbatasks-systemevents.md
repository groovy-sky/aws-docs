# Setting and unsetting system diagnostic events

To set and unset diagnostic events at the session level, you can use the Oracle SQL statement `ALTER
                    SESSION SET EVENTS`. However, to set events at the system level you can't use Oracle SQL. Instead,
use the system event procedures in the `rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util` package. The system event
procedures are available in the following engine versions:

- All Oracle Database 21c versions

- 19.0.0.0.ru-2020-10.rur-2020-10.r1 and higher Oracle Database 19c versions

For more information, see [Version 19.0.0.0.ru-2020-10.rur-2020-10.r1](../oraclereleasenotes/oracle-version-19-0.md#oracle-version-RU-RUR.19.0.0.0.ru-2020-10.rur-2020-10.r1) in the
_Amazon RDS for Oracle Release Notes_

###### Important

Internally, the `rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util` package sets events by
using the `ALTER SYSTEM SET EVENTS` statement. This `ALTER
                        SYSTEM` statement isn't documented in the Oracle Database
documentation. Some system diagnostic events can generate large amounts of
tracing information, cause contention, or affect database availability. We
recommend that you test specific diagnostic events in your nonproduction
database, and only set events in your production database under guidance of
Oracle Support.

## Listing allowed system diagnostic events

To list the system events that you can set, use the Amazon RDS procedure
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.list_allowed_system_events`. This
procedure accepts no parameters.

The following example lists all system events that you can set.

```

SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
EXEC rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.list_allowed_system_events;
```

The following sample output lists event numbers and their descriptions. Use
the Amazon RDS procedures `set_system_event` to set these events and
`unset_system_event` to unset them.

```

###### Note

The list of the allowed system events can change over time. To make sure
that you have the most recent list of eligible events, use
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.list_allowed_system_events`.

## Setting system diagnostic events

To set a system event, use the Amazon RDS procedure
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.set_system_event`. You can only set
events listed in the output of
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.list_allowed_system_events`. The
`set_system_event` procedure accepts the following
parameters.

Parameter nameData typeDefaultRequiredDescription

`p_event`

number

—

Yes

The system event number. The value must be one of the
event numbers reported by
`list_allowed_system_events`.

`p_level`

number

—

Yes

The event level. See the Oracle Database documentation or
Oracle Support for descriptions of different level
values.

The procedure `set_system_event` constructs and runs the required
`ALTER SYSTEM SET EVENTS` statements according to the following
principles:

- The event type ( `context` or `errorstack`) is
determined automatically.

- A statement in the form `ALTER SYSTEM SET EVENTS
                                      'event LEVEL
                                      event_level'` sets the context
events. This notation is equivalent to `ALTER SYSTEM SET EVENTS
                                      'event TRACE NAME CONTEXT FOREVER,
                                  LEVEL event_level'`.

- A statement in the form `ALTER SYSTEM SET EVENTS
                                      'event ERRORSTACK
                                      (event_level)'` sets the error
stack events. This notation is equivalent to `ALTER SYSTEM SET
                                  EVENTS 'event TRACE NAME ERRORSTACK LEVEL
                                      event_level'`.

The following example sets event 942 at level 3, and event 10442 at level 10.
Sample output is included.

```

SQL> SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
SQL> EXEC rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.set_system_event(942,3);
Setting system event 942 with: alter system set events '942 errorstack (3)'

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

SQL> EXEC rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.set_system_event(10442,10);
Setting system event 10442 with: alter system set events '10442 level 10'

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
```

## Listing system diagnostic events that are set

To list the system events that are currently set, use the Amazon RDS procedure
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.list_set_system_events`. This procedure
reports only events set at system level by `set_system_event`.

The following example lists the active system events.

```

SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
EXEC rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.list_set_system_events;
```

The following sample output shows the list of events, the event type, the
level at which the events are currently set, and the time when the event was
set.

```

942 errorstack (3) - set at 2020-11-03 11:42:27
10442 level 10 - set at 2020-11-03 11:42:41

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
```

## Unsetting system diagnostic events

To unset a system event, use the Amazon RDS procedure
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.unset_system_event`. You can only unset
events listed in the output of
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.list_allowed_system_events`. The
`unset_system_event` procedure accepts the following
parameter.

Parameter nameData typeDefaultRequiredDescription

`p_event`

number

—

Yes

The system event number. The value must be one of the
event numbers reported by
`list_allowed_system_events`.

The following example unsets events 942 and 10442. Sample output is
included.

```

SQL> SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
SQL> EXEC rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.unset_system_event(942);
Unsetting system event 942 with: alter system set events '942 off'

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

SQL> EXEC rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.unset_system_event(10442);
Unsetting system event 10442 with: alter system set events '10442 off'

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
```
