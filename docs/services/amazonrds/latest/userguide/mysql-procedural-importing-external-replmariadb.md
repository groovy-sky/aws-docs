# Configuring binary log file position replication with an external source instance

You can set up replication between an RDS for MySQL or MariaDB DB instance and a
MySQL or MariaDB instance that is external to Amazon RDS using binary log file replication.

## Before you begin

You can configure replication using the binary log file position of replicated transactions.

The permissions required to start replication on an Amazon RDS DB instance are
restricted and not available to your Amazon RDS master user. Because of this, make sure that
you use the Amazon RDS [mysql.rds\_set\_external\_master (RDS for MariaDB and RDS for MySQL major versions 8.0 and lower)](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_set_external_master) or [mysql.rds\_set\_external\_source (RDS for MySQL major versions 8.4 and higher)](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_set_external_source), and [mysql.rds\_start\_replication](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_start_replication)
commands to set up replication between your live database and your Amazon RDS
database.

To set the binary logging format for a MySQL or MariaDB database, update the
`binlog_format` parameter. If your DB instance uses the default DB
instance parameter group, create a new DB parameter group to modify the
`binlog_format` parameter. In MariaDB and MySQL 8.0 and lower versions,
`binlog_format` defaults to `MIXED`. However, you can also set
`binlog_format` to `ROW` or `STATEMENT` if you need
a specific binary log (binlog) format. Reboot your DB instance for the change to take
effect. In MySQL 8.4 and higher versions, `binlog_format` defaults to
`ROW`.

For information about setting the `binlog_format` parameter, see
[Configuring RDS for MySQL binary logging for Single-AZ databases](user-logaccess-mysql-binaryformat.md).
For information about the implications of different MySQL replication types, see
[Advantages\
and disadvantages of statement-based and row-based replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-sbr-rbr.html) in the MySQL documentation.

## Configuring binary log file position replication with an external source instance

Follow these guidelines when you set up an external source instance and a replica on Amazon RDS:

- Monitor failover events for the Amazon RDS DB instance that is your replica. If a failover
occurs, then the DB instance that is your replica might be recreated on a new
host with a different network address. For information on how to monitor
failover events, see [Working with Amazon RDS event notification](user-events.md).

- Maintain the binlogs on your source instance until you have verified that they have been
applied to the replica. This maintenance makes sure that you can restore your
source instance in the event of a failure.

- Turn on automated backups on your Amazon RDS DB instance. Turning on automated backups makes sure
that you can restore your replica to a particular point in time if you need
to re-synchronize your source instance and replica. For information on backups and
point-in-time restore, see [Backing up, restoring, and exporting data](chap-commontasks-backuprestore.md).

###### To configure binary log file replication with an external source instance

1. Make the source MySQL or MariaDB instance read-only.

```sql

mysql> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
mysql> SET GLOBAL read_only = ON;
```

2. Run the `SHOW MASTER STATUS` command on the source MySQL or MariaDB
    instance to determine the binlog location.

You receive output similar to the following example.

```nohighlight

File                        Position
   ------------------------------------
    mysql-bin-changelog.000031      107
   ------------------------------------
```

3. Copy the database from the external instance to the Amazon RDS DB instance using
    `mysqldump`. For very large databases, you might want to use the
    procedure in [Importing data to an Amazon RDS for MySQL database with reduced downtime](mysql-importing-data-reduced-downtime.md).

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

mysqldump --databases database_name \
       --single-transaction \
       --compress \
       --order-by-primary \
       -u local_user \
       -plocal_password | mysql \
           --host=hostname \
           --port=3306 \
           -u RDS_user_name \
           -pRDS_password
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

mysqldump --databases database_name ^
       --single-transaction ^
       --compress ^
       --order-by-primary ^
       -u local_user ^
       -plocal_password | mysql ^
           --host=hostname ^
           --port=3306 ^
           -u RDS_user_name ^
           -pRDS_password
```

###### Note

Make sure that there isn't a space between the `-p` option
and the entered password.

To specify the host name, user name, port, and password to connect to your
    Amazon RDS DB instance, use the `--host`, `--user (-u)`,
    `--port` and `-p` options in the `mysql`
    command. The host name is the Domain Name Service (DNS) name from the Amazon RDS DB
    instance endpoint, for example
    `myinstance.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`. You can
    find the endpoint value in the instance details in the AWS Management Console.

4. Make the source MySQL or MariaDB instance writeable again.

```sql

mysql> SET GLOBAL read_only = OFF;
mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
```

For more information on making backups for use with replication, see [the MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-solutions-backups-read-only.html).

5. In the AWS Management Console, add the IP address of the server that hosts the external
    database to the virtual private cloud (VPC) security group for the Amazon RDS DB
    instance. For more information on modifying a VPC security group, see [Security groups for your\
    VPC](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-securitygroups.md) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.

The IP address can change when the following conditions are met:

- You are using a public IP address for communication between the
external source instance and the DB instance.

- The external source instance was stopped and restarted.

If these conditions are met, verify the IP address before adding it.

You might also need to configure your local network to permit connections from
the IP address of your Amazon RDS DB instance. You do this so that your local network
can communicate with your external MySQL or MariaDB instance. To find the IP
address of the Amazon RDS DB instance, use the `host` command.

```nohighlight

host db_instance_endpoint
```

The host name is the DNS name from the Amazon RDS DB instance endpoint.

6. Using the client of your choice, connect to the external instance and create a
    user to use for replication. Use this account solely for replication and
    restrict it to your domain to improve security. The following is an example.

```sql

CREATE USER 'repl_user'@'mydomain.com' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

###### Note

Specify a password other than the prompt shown here as a security best
practice.

7. For the external instance, grant `REPLICATION CLIENT` and
    `REPLICATION SLAVE` privileges to your replication user. For
    example, to grant the `REPLICATION CLIENT` and `REPLICATION
                           SLAVE` privileges on all databases for the ' `repl_user`'
    user for your domain, issue the following command.

```sql

GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT, REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repl_user'@'mydomain.com';
```

8. Make the Amazon RDS DB instance the replica. To do so, first connect to the Amazon RDS
    DB instance as the master user. Then identify the external MySQL or MariaDB
    database as the source instance by using the [mysql.rds\_set\_external\_source (RDS for MySQL major versions 8.4 and higher)](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_set_external_source) or [mysql.rds\_set\_external\_master (RDS for MariaDB and RDS for MySQL major versions 8.0 and lower)](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_set_external_master) command. Use the master log
    file name and master log position that you determined in step 2. The following
    commands are examples.

**MySQL 8.4**

```nohighlight

CALL mysql.rds_set_external_source ('mysourceserver.mydomain.com', 3306, 'repl_user', 'password', 'mysql-bin-changelog.000031', 107, 1);
```

**MariaDB and MySQL 8.0 and 5.7**

```sql

CALL mysql.rds_set_external_master ('mymasterserver.mydomain.com', 3306, 'repl_user', 'password', 'mysql-bin-changelog.000031', 107, 1);
```

###### Note

On RDS for MySQL, you can choose to use delayed replication by running the
[mysql.rds\_set\_external\_source\_with\_delay (RDS for MySQL major versions 8.4 and higher)](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_set_external_source_with_delay) or [mysql.rds\_set\_external\_master\_with\_delay (RDS for MariaDB and RDS for MySQL major versions 8.0 and lower)](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_set_external_master_with_delay) stored
procedure instead. On RDS for MySQL, one reason to use delayed replication is
to turn on disaster recovery with the [mysql.rds\_start\_replication\_until](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_start_replication_until) stored procedure.
Currently, RDS for MariaDB supports delayed replication but doesn't support the
`mysql.rds_start_replication_until` procedure.

9. On the Amazon RDS DB instance, issue the [mysql.rds\_start\_replication](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_start_replication) command to start
    replication.

```sql

CALL mysql.rds_start_replication;
```
