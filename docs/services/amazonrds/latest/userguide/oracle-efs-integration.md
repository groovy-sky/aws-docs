# Amazon EFS integration

Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides serverless, fully elastic file storage so that you can share
file data without provisioning or managing storage capacity and performance. With Amazon EFS, you
can create a file system and then mount it in your VPC through the NFS versions 4.0 and 4.1
(NFSv4) protocol. Then you can use the EFS file system like any other POSIX-compliant file
system. For general information, see [What is Amazon Elastic File System?](../../../efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.md) and the AWS
blog [Integrate Amazon RDS for Oracle with Amazon EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/integrate-amazon-rds-for-oracle-with-amazon-efs).

## Overview of Amazon EFS integration

With Amazon EFS, you can transfer files between your RDS for Oracle DB instance and an EFS file system. For
example, you can use EFS to support the following use cases:

- Share a file system between applications and multiple database servers.

- Create a shared directory for migration-related files, including transportable
tablespace data files. For more information, see [Migrating using Oracle transportable tablespaces](oracle-migrating-tts.md).

- Store and share archived redo log files without allocating additional storage
space on the server.

- Use Oracle Database utilities such as `UTL_FILE` to read and write
files.

### Advantages to Amazon EFS integration

When you choose an EFS file system over alternative data transfer solutions, you get
the following benefits:

- You can transfer Oracle Data Pump files between Amazon EFS and your RDS for Oracle DB instance.
You don’t need to copy these files locally because Data Pump imports directly
from the EFS file system. For more information, see [Importing data into Oracle on Amazon RDS](oracle-procedural-importing.md).

- Data migration is faster than using a database link.

- You avoid allocating storage space on your RDS for Oracle DB instance to hold the
files.

- An EFS file systems can automatically scale storage without requiring you to
provision it.

- Amazon EFS integration has no minimum fees or setup costs. You pay only for what
you use.

- Amazon EFS integration supports two forms of encryption: encryption of data in
transit and encryption at rest. Encryption of data in transit is enabled by
default using TLS version 1.2. You can enable encryption of data at rest when
creating an Amazon EFS file system. For more information, see [Encrypting\
data at rest](../../../efs/latest/ug/encryption-at-rest.md) in the _Amazon Elastic File System User_
_Guide_.

### Requirements for Amazon EFS integration

Make sure that you meet the following requirements:

- Your database must run database version 19.0.0.0.ru-2022-07.rur-2022-07.r1 or
higher.

- Your DB instance and your EFS file system must be in the same AWS Region, VPC, and
AWS account. RDS for Oracle doesn't support cross-account and cross-Region access
for EFS.

- Your VPC must have both **DNS Resolution** and **DNS**
**Hostnames** enabled. For more information, see [DNS attributes in your VPC](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.md#vpc-dns-support) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User_
_Guide_.

- If you use a DNS name in the `mount` command, make sure your VPC
configured to use the DNS server provided by Amazon. Custom DNS servers aren't
supported.

- You must use non-RDS solutions to back up your EFS file system. RDS for Oracle
doesn't support automated backups or manual DB snapshots of an EFS file system.
For more information, see [Backing up your Amazon EFS file\
systems](../../../efs/latest/ug/efs-backup-solutions.md).
