## Quotas in Amazon RDS

Each AWS account has quotas, for each AWS Region, on the number of Amazon RDS
resources that can be created. After a quota for a resource has been reached, additional
calls to create that resource fail with an exception.

The following table lists the resources and their quotas per AWS Region.

This quota does not apply to Amazon Aurora, which has a maximum cluster volume of 128 TiB for each DB cluster.

###### Note

By default, you can have up to a total of 40 DB instances. RDS DB instances, Aurora
DB instances, Amazon Neptune instances, and Amazon DocumentDB instances apply to this
quota.

The following limitations apply to the Amazon RDS DB
instances:

- 10 for each SQL Server edition (Enterprise, Standard, Web, and Express)
under the "license-included" model

- 10 for Oracle under the "license-included" model

- 40
for Db2 under the "bring-your-own-license" (BYOL) licensing model

- 40 for MySQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL

- 40 for Oracle under the "bring-your-own-license" (BYOL) licensing
model

If your application requires more DB instances, you can request additional DB
instances by opening the [Service Quotas\
console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-1). In the navigation pane, choose **AWS**
**services**. Choose **Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon**
**RDS)**, choose a quota, and follow the directions to request a quota
increase. For more information, see [Requesting a quota\
increase](../../../servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-increase.md) in the _Service Quotas User Guide_.

For RDS for Oracle, you can create up to 15 read replicas per source DB instance in each
Region, but we recommend limiting replicas to 5 to minimize replication lag.

Backups managed by AWS Backup are considered manual DB snapshots, but don't count toward the manual snapshot quota. For information about AWS Backup,
see the [_AWS Backup Developer Guide_](../../../aws-backup/latest/devguide.md).

Note that the default quota for cross-Region
automated backups is 20 for an AWS account, the default quota for the number of
concurrent snapshot copy requests is 20 for each Region for an
AWS account, and the default quota for the number of concurrent
cross-Region read replica requests is 20 for each
Region for an AWS account.

If you use any RDS API operations and exceed the default quota for the number of calls
per second, the Amazon RDS API issues an error like the following one.

**`ClientError: An error occurred (ThrottlingException) when calling the**
**API_name operation: Rate exceeded.`**

Here, reduce the number of calls per second. The quota is meant to cover most use
cases. If higher quotas are needed, you can request a quota increase by using one of the
following options:

- From the console, open the [Service\
Quotas console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home).

- From the AWS CLI, use the [request-service-quota-increase](../../../cli/latest/reference/service-quotas/request-service-quota-increase.md) AWS CLI command.

For more information, see the [_Service_\
_Quotas User Guide_](../../../servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.md).

## Naming constraints in Amazon RDS

The naming constraints in Amazon RDS are as follows:

- DB instance identifier:

- Must contain 1–63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

- First character must be a letter.

- Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive
hyphens.

- Must be unique for all DB instances per AWS account, per AWS
Region.

- Initial database name:

- Database name constraints differ for each database engine. For more
information, see the available settings when creating each DB
instance.

- SQL Server – Create your databases after creating your DB
instance.

- Master username – Master username constraints differ for each database
engine. For more information, see the available settings when creating the DB
instance.

- Master password:

- The password for the database master user can include any printable
ASCII character except `/`, `'`, `"`,
`@`, or a space.

For Oracle, `&` is an additional
character limitation.

- The password can contain the following number of printable ASCII
characters depending on the DB engine:

- Db2: 8–255

- MariaDB and MySQL: 8–41

- Oracle: 8–30

- SQL Server and PostgreSQL: 8–128

- DB parameter group:

- Must contain 1–255 alphanumeric characters.

- First character must be a letter.

- Hyphens are allowed, but the name cannot end with a hyphen or contain
two consecutive hyphens.

- DB subnet group:

- Must contain 1–255 characters.

- Alphanumeric characters, spaces, hyphens, underscores, and periods are
allowed.

## Maximum number of database connections

The maximum number of simultaneous database connections varies by the DB engine type
and the memory allocation for the DB instance class. The maximum number of connections
is generally set in the parameter group associated with the DB instance. The exception
is Microsoft SQL Server, where it is set in the server properties for the DB instance in
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

Database connections consume memory. Setting one of these parameters too high can
cause a low memory condition that might cause a DB instance to be placed in the
**incompatible-parameters** status. For more information, see [Diagnosing and resolving incompatible parameters status for a memory limit](chap-troubleshooting.md#CHAP_Troubleshooting.incompatible-parameters-memory).

If your applications frequently open and close connections, or keep a large number of
long-lived connections open, we recommend that you use Amazon RDS Proxy. RDS Proxy is a fully
managed, highly available database proxy that uses connection pooling to share database
connections securely and efficiently. To learn more about RDS Proxy, see [Amazon RDS Proxy](rds-proxy.md).

###### Note

For Oracle, you set the maximum number of user processes and user and system
sessions.

For
Db2, you can't set maximum connections. The limit is 64000.

The following table shows information about the maximum database connections for
different DB engines.

DB engineParameterAllowed valuesDefault valueDescriptionMariaDB`max_connections`1–100000

- For MariaDB 10.5 and higher versions, the default
is:

LEAST({DBInstanceClassMemory/25165760},12000)

The formula is effectively equivalent to MB/25.

If the default value calculation results in a value
greater than 12,000, Amazon RDS sets the limit to 12,000.

- For MariaDB version 10.4:

{DBInstanceClassMemory/12582880}

The formula is effectively equivalent to MB/12.

For more information, see
[Configure the user connections (server configuration\
option)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-user-connections-server-configuration-option?view=sql-server-ver16).

`DBInstanceClassMemory` is in bytes. For details about how this value is
calculated, see [Specifying DB parameters](user-paramvaluesref.md). Because of memory reserved for the operating system and RDS management processes,
this memory size is smaller than the value in gibibytes (GiB) shown in [Hardware specifications for DB instance classes](concepts-dbinstanceclass-summary.md).

For example, some DB instance classes have 8 GiB of memory, which is 8,589,934,592
bytes. For a MySQL DB instance running on a DB instance class with 8 GiB of memory, such
as db.m7g.large, the equation that uses the total memory would be
`8589934592/12582880=683`. However, the variable
`DBInstanceClassMemory` automatically subtracts the amounts reserved to
the operating system and the RDS processes that manage the DB instance. The remainder of
the subtraction is then divided by 12,582,880. This calculation results in approximately
630 for the value of `max_connections` instead of 683. This value depends on
the DB instance class and DB engine.

When a MariaDB or MySQL DB instance is running on a small DB instance class, such as
db.t3.micro or db.t3.small, the total memory available is low. For these DB instance
classes, RDS reserves a significant portion of the available memory, which affects the
value `max_connections`. For example, the default maximum number of
connections for a MySQL DB instance running on a db.t3.micro DB instance class is
approximately 60. You can determine the `max_connections` value for your DB
MariaDB or MySQL DB instance by connecting to it and running the following SQL
command:

```sql

SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'max_connections';
```

## File size limits in Amazon RDS

File size limits apply to certain Amazon RDS DB instances. For more information, see the
following engine-specific limits:

- [MariaDB file size limits in Amazon RDS](chap-mariadb-limitations.md#RDS_Limits.FileSize.MariaDB)

- [MySQL file size limits in Amazon RDS](mysql-knownissuesandlimitations.md#MySQL.Concepts.Limits.FileSize)

- [Oracle file size limits in Amazon RDS](oracle-concepts-limitations.md#Oracle.Concepts.file-size-limits)
