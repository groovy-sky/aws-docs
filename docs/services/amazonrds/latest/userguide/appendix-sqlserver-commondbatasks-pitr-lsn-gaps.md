# Troubleshooting point-in-time-recovery failures due to a log sequence number gap

When attempting point-in-time-recovery (PITR) in RDS for SQL Server, you might encounter failures due
to gaps in log sequence numbers (LSNs). These gaps prevent RDS from restoring your
database to the requested time and RDS places your restoring instance in
`incompatible-restore` state.

Common causes for this issue are:

- Manual changes to the database recovery model.

- Automatic recovery model changes by RDS due to insufficient resources for completing
transaction log backups.

To identify LSN gaps in your database, run this query:

```sql

SELECT * FROM msdb.dbo.rds_fn_list_tlog_backup_metadata(database_name)
ORDER BY backup_file_time_utc desc;
```

If you discover an LSN gap, you can:

- Choose a restore point before the LSN gap.

- Wait and restore to a point after the next instance backup completes.

To prevent this issue, we recommend you don't manually change the recovery model of your RDS for SQL Server databases, as it interrupts instance durability.
We also recommend you choose an instance type with sufficient resources for your workload to ensure regular transaction log backups.
