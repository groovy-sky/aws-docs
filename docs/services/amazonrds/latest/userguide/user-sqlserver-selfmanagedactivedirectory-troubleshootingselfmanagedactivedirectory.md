# Troubleshooting self-managed Active Directory

The following are issues you might encounter when you set up or modify self-managed AD.

Error CodeDescriptionCommon causesTroubleshooting suggestions

Error 2 / 0x2

**`The system cannot find the file specified.`**

The format or location for the Organizational Unit (OU) specified with the `—domain-ou` parameter is invalid.
The domain service account specified via AWS Secrets Manager lack the permissions required to join the OU.

Review the `—domain-ou` parameter. Ensure the domain service account has the correct permissions to the OU.
For more information, see
[Configure your AD domain service account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_SQLServer_SelfManagedActiveDirectory.Requirements.html#USER_SQLServer_SelfManagedActiveDirectory.Requirements.DomainAccountConfig).

Error 5 / 0x5

**`Access is denied.`**

Misconfigured permissions for the domain service account, or the computer account already exists in the domain.

Review the domain service account permissions in the domain, and verify that the RDS computer account is not duplicated in the domain. You can
verify the name of the RDS computer account by running `SELECT @@SERVERNAME` on your RDS for SQL Server DB instance. If you are using Multi-AZ, try rebooting with failover and then verify that the
RDS computer account again. For more information, see
[Rebooting a DB instance](user-rebootinstance.md).

Error 87 / 0x57

**`The parameter is incorrect.`**

The domain service account specified via AWS Secrets Manager doesn't have the correct permissions. The user profile may also be corrupted.

Review the requirements for the domain service account. For more information, see
[Configure your AD domain service account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_SQLServer_SelfManagedActiveDirectory.Requirements.html#USER_SQLServer_SelfManagedActiveDirectory.Requirements.DomainAccountConfig).

Error 234 / 0xEA

**`Specified Organizational Unit (OU) does not exist.`**

The OU specified with the `—domain-ou` parameter doesn't exist in your self-managed AD.

Review the `—domain-ou` parameter and ensure the specified OU exists in your self-managed AD.

Error 1326 / 0x52E

**`The user name or password is incorrect.`**

The domain service account credentials provided in AWS Secrets Manager contains an unknown username or bad password.
The domain account may also be disabled in your self-managed AD.

Ensure the credentials provided in AWS
Secrets Manager are correct and the domain account is enabled in your self-managed AD.

Error 1355 / 0x54B

**`The specified domain either does not exist or could not be contacted.`**

The domain is down, the specified set of DNS IPs are unreachable, or the specified FQDN is unreachable.

Review the `—domain-dns-ips` and `—domain-fqdn` parameters to ensure they're correct.
Review the networking configuration of your RDS for SQL Server DB instance and ensure your self-managed AD is reachable. For more information, see
[Configure your network connectivity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_SQLServer_SelfManagedActiveDirectory.Requirements.html#USER_SQLServer_SelfManagedActiveDirectory.Requirements.NetworkConfig).

Error 1722 / 0x6BA

**`The RPC server is unavailable.`**

There was an issue reaching the RPC service of your AD domain. This might be a service or network issue.

Validate that the RPC service is running on your domain controllers and that the TCP ports `135` and `49152-65535` are reachable on your domain from your RDS for SQL Server DB instance.

Error 1727 / 0x6BF

**`The remote procedure call failed and did not**
**execute.`**

Network connectivity issue or firewall restriction blocking RPC
communication to the domain controller.

If using Cross VPC domain join, validate Cross VPC communication
is setup correctly with either VPC peering or Transit Gateway.
Ensure TCP high ports `49152-65535` are reachable on your
domain from your RDS for SQL Server DB instance, including any possible
firewall restrictions.

Error 2224 / 0x8B0

**`The user account already exists.`**

The computer account that's attempting to be added to your self-managed AD already exists.

Identify the computer account by running `SELECT @@SERVERNAME` on your RDS for SQL Server DB instance and then carefully remove it from your self-managed AD.

Error 2242 / 0x8c2

**`The password of this user has expired.`**

The password for the domain service account specified via AWS Secrets Manager has expired.

Update the password for the domain service account used to join your RDS for SQL Server DB instance to your self-managed AD.

After joining your DB instance to a self-managed Active Directory domain, you might receive RDS events related to your domain health.

```nohighlight

Unhealthy domain state detected while attempt to verify or
configure your Kerberos endpoint in your domain on
node node_n. message
```

For Multi-AZ instances, you might notice the error reporting for both node1 and node2,
which indicates your instance's Kerberos configuration is not ready for failover. In the
event of a failover, you might experience authentication difficulties using Kerberos.
Resolve the configuration issues to ensure Kerberos setup is valid and up to date. For
Multi-AZ instances, no actions are required to use Kerberos authentication on the new
primary host given all network and permission configurations are in place.

For Single-AZ instances, node1 is the primary node. If your Kerberos authentication is not
working as expected, check the instance events and resolve the configuration
issues to ensure Kerberos setup is valid and up to date.
