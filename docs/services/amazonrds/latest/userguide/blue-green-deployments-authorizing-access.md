# Authorizing access to Amazon RDS blue/green deployment operations

Users must have the required permissions to perform operations related to blue/green
deployments. You can create IAM policies that grant users and roles permission to perform
specific API operations on the specified resources they need. You can then attach those
policies to the IAM permission sets or roles that require those permissions. For more information,
see [Identity and access management for Amazon RDS](usingwithrds-iam.md).

The user who creates a blue/green deployment must have permissions to perform the following RDS operations:

- `rds:CreateBlueGreenDeployment`

- `rds:AddTagsToResource`

- `rds:CreateDBInstanceReadReplica`

The user who switches over a blue/green deployment must have permissions to perform the following RDS operations:

- `rds:SwitchoverBlueGreenDeployment`

- `rds:ModifyDBInstance`

- `rds:PromoteReadReplica`

The user who deletes a blue/green deployment must have permissions to perform the following RDS
operation:

- `rds:DeleteBlueGreenDeployment`

- `rds:DeleteDBInstance`

Amazon RDS
provisions and modifies resources in the staging environment on your behalf. These resources
include DB instances that use an internally defined naming convention. Therefore, attached IAM
policies can't contain partial resource name patterns such as `my-db-prefix-*`.
Only wildcards (\*) are supported. In general, we recommend using resource tags and other
supported attributes to control access to these resources, rather than wildcards. For more
information, see [Actions, resources, and\
condition keys for Amazon RDS](../../../service-authorization/latest/reference/list-amazonrds.md).
