# Deleting retained automated backups

You can delete retained automated backups when they are no longer needed.

###### To delete a retained automated backup

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Automated backups**.

3. On the **Retained** tab, choose the retained automated backup that you want to delete.

4. For **Actions**, choose **Delete**.

5. On the confirmation page, enter `delete me` and choose
    **Delete**.

You can delete a retained automated backup by using the AWS CLI command [delete-db-instance-automated-backup](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/delete-db-instance-automated-backup.md) with the
following option:

- `--dbi-resource-id` – The resource identifier for the source DB instance.

You can find the resource identifier for the source DB instance of a retained automated backup by running the
AWS CLI command [describe-db-instance-automated-backups](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instance-automated-backups.md).

###### Example

The following example deletes the retained automated backup with source DB instance resource identifier
`db-123ABCEXAMPLE`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds delete-db-instance-automated-backup \
    --dbi-resource-id db-123ABCEXAMPLE
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds delete-db-instance-automated-backup ^
    --dbi-resource-id db-123ABCEXAMPLE
```

You can delete a retained automated backup by using the Amazon RDS API operation [DeleteDBInstanceAutomatedBackup](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-deletedbinstanceautomatedbackup.md) with the
following parameter:

- `DbiResourceId` – The resource identifier for the source DB instance.

You can find the resource identifier for the source DB instance of a retained automated backup using the Amazon RDS
API operation [DescribeDBInstanceAutomatedBackups](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbinstanceautomatedbackups.md).

## Disabling automated backups

You might want to temporarily disable automated backups in certain situations, for
example while loading large amounts of data.

###### Important

We highly discourage disabling automated backups because it disables point-in-time
recovery. Disabling automatic backups for a DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster
deletes all existing automated backups for the database. If you disable and then
re-enable automated backups, you can restore starting only from the time you
re-enabled automated backups.

###### To disable automated backups immediately

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and
    then choose the DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster that you want to
    modify.

3. Choose **Modify**.

4. For **Backup retention period**, choose **0 days**.

5. Choose **Continue**.

6. Choose **Apply immediately**.

7. Choose **Modify DB instance** or **Modify**
**cluster** to save your changes and disable automated
    backups.

To disable automated backups immediately, use the [modify-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.md) or
[modify-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster.md) command and set the backup retention period to 0
with `--apply-immediately`.

###### Example

The following example immediately disables automatic backups on a Multi-AZ
DB cluster.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster \
    --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster \
    --backup-retention-period 0 \
    --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster ^
    --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster ^
    --backup-retention-period 0 ^
    --apply-immediately
```

To know when the modification is in effect, call
`describe-db-instances` for the DB instance (or
`describe-db-clusters` for a Multi-AZ DB cluster) until the value
for backup retention period is 0 and `mydbcluster` status is
available.

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier mydcluster
```

To disable automated backups immediately, call the [ModifyDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbinstance.md) or
[ModifyDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbcluster.md)
operation with the following parameters:

- `DBInstanceIdentifier = mydbinstance` (or
`DBClusterIdentifier = mydbcluster`)

- `BackupRetentionPeriod = 0`

###### Example

```nohighlight

https://rds.amazonaws.com/
    ?Action=ModifyDBInstance
    &DBInstanceIdentifier=mydbinstance
    &BackupRetentionPeriod=0
    &SignatureVersion=2
    &SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256
    &Timestamp=2009-10-14T17%3A48%3A21.746Z
    &AWSAccessKeyId=<&AWS; Access Key ID>
    &Signature=<Signature>
```
