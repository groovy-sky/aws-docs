# Restoring an SSAS database

Use the following stored procedure to restore an SSAS database from a backup.

You can't restore a database if there is an existing SSAS database with the same name.
The stored procedure for restoring doesn't support encrypted backup files.

```nohighlight

exec msdb.dbo.rds_msbi_task
@task_type='SSAS_RESTORE_DB',
@database_name='mynewssasdb',
@file_path='D:\S3\ssas_db_backup.abf';
```

The following parameters are required:

- `@task_type` – The type of the MSBI task, in this case `SSAS_RESTORE_DB`.

- `@database_name` – The name of the new SSAS database that you're restoring to.

- `@file_path` – The path to the SSAS backup file.

## Restoring a DB instance to a specified time

Point-in-time recovery (PITR) doesn't apply to SSAS databases. If you do PITR, only
the SSAS data in the last snapshot before the requested time is available on the
restored instance.

###### To have up-to-date SSAS databases on a restored DB instance

1. Back up your SSAS databases to the `D:\S3` folder on the source
    instance.

2. Transfer the backup files to the S3 bucket.

3. Transfer the backup files from the S3 bucket to the `D:\S3`
    folder on the restored instance.

4. Run the stored procedure to restore the SSAS databases onto the restored
    instance.

You can also reprocess the SSAS project to restore the databases.
