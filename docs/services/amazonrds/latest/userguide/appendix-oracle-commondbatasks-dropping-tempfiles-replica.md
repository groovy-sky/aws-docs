# Dropping tempfiles on a read replica

You can't drop an existing temporary tablespace on a read replica. You can
change the tempfile storage on a read replica from Amazon EBS to the instance
store, or from the instance store to Amazon EBS. To achieve these goals, do the
following:

1. Drop the current tempfiles in the temporary tablespace on the read
    replica.

2. Create new tempfiles on different storage.

To drop the tempfiles, use the Amazon RDS procedure
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util. drop_replica_tempfiles`. You can use
this procedure only on read replicas. The
`drop_replica_tempfiles` procedure has the following
parameters.

Parameter nameData typeDefaultRequiredDescription

`p_tablespace_name`

varchar

—

Yes

The name of the temporary tablespace on your read
replica.

Assume that a temporary tablespace named `temp01`
resides in the instance store on your read replica. Drop all tempfiles in
this tablespace by running the following command.

```sql

EXEC rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.drop_replica_tempfiles(p_tablespace_name => 'temp01');
```
