# Considerations for restoring DB instances on Amazon RDS on AWS Outposts

When you restore a DB instance in Amazon RDS on AWS Outposts, you can generally choose the
storage location for automated backups and manual snapshots of the restored DB
instance.

- When restoring from a manual DB snapshot, you can store backups either in the parent AWS Region or locally on your
Outpost.

- When restoring from an automated backup (point-in-time recovery), you have fewer choices:

- If restoring from the parent AWS Region, you can store backups either in the AWS Region or on your
Outpost.

- If restoring from your Outpost, you can store backups only on your Outpost.
