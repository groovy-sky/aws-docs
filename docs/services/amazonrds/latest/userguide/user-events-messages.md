failure

RDS-EVENT-0079

Amazon RDS has been unable to create credentials for enhanced monitoring
and this feature has been disabled. This is likely due to the
rds-monitoring-role not being present and configured correctly in your
account. Please refer to the troubleshooting section in the Amazon RDS
documentation for further details.

Enhanced Monitoring can't be enabled without the Enhanced Monitoring
IAM role. For information about creating the IAM role, see [To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS enhanced monitoring](user-monitoring-os-enabling.md#USER_Monitoring.OS.IAMRole).

failure

RDS-EVENT-0080

Amazon RDS has been unable to configure enhanced monitoring on your
instance: `name` and this feature has been
disabled. This is likely due to the rds-monitoring-role not being
present and configured correctly in your account. Please refer to the
troubleshooting section in the Amazon RDS documentation for further
details.

Enhanced Monitoring was disabled because an error occurred during the
configuration change. It is likely that the Enhanced Monitoring IAM role
is configured incorrectly. For information about creating the enhanced
monitoring IAM role, see [To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS enhanced monitoring](user-monitoring-os-enabling.md#USER_Monitoring.OS.IAMRole).

failure

RDS-EVENT-0081

in the Amazon RDS documentation for further details.

The IAM role that you use to access your Amazon S3 bucket for SQL Server
native backup and restore is configured incorrectly. For more
information, see [Setting up for native backup and restore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.Procedural.Importing.Native.Enabling.html).

database configuration, you can log in to the host to fix
it.

For more information, see [RDS Custom support perimeter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-concept.html#custom-troubleshooting.support-perimeter).

to enable higher performance. For more information, see [I/O credits and burst performance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html#EBSVolumeTypes_gp2) in
the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.

RDS-EVENT-0225

Allocated storage size `amount` GB is
approaching the maximum storage threshold
`amount` GB. Increase the maximum storage
threshold.

This event is invoked when the allocated storage reaches 80% of the
maximum storage threshold. To avoid the event, increase the maximum
storage threshold.

notification

RDS-EVENT-0231

Your DB instance's storage modification encountered an internal error. The
modification request is pending and will be retried later.

An error has occurred in the read replication process. For more
information, see the event message.

`message`. For more information see the RDS
Optimized Writes for `name`
documentation.

RDS Optimized Writes is incompatible with the instance storage
configuration. For more information, see [Improving write performance with RDS Optimized Writes for MySQL](rds-optimized-writes.md) and [Improving write performance with Amazon RDS Optimized Writes for MariaDB](rds-optimized-writes-mariadb.md).

You can perform storage configuration upgrade to enable Optimized

notification

RDS-EVENT-0297

The storage configuration for DB instance
`name` supports a maximum size of 16384
GiB. Perform a storage configuration upgrade to support storage sizes
greater than 16384 GiB.

You cannot increase the allocated storage size of the DB instance
beyond 16384 GiB. To overcome this limitation, perform a storage
configuration upgrade. For more information, see [Upgrading the storage file system for a DB instance](user-piops-storagetypes.md#USER_PIOPS.UpgradeFileSystem).

notification

RDS-EVENT-0298

The storage configuration for DB instance
`name` supports a maximum table size of
2048 GiB. Perform a storage configuration upgrade to support table sizes
greater than 2048 GiB.

RDS MySQL and MariaDB instances with this limitation cannot have a
table size exceeding 2048 GiB. To overcome this limitation, perform a
storage configuration upgrade. For more information, see [Upgrading the storage file system for a DB instance](user-piops-storagetypes.md#USER_PIOPS.UpgradeFileSystem).
