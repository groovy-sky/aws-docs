# Recommendations from Amazon RDS reference

Amazon RDS generates recommendations for a resource when the resource is
created or modified. You can find examples of recommendations from Amazon RDS in
the following table.

TypeDescriptionRecommendationDowntime requiredAdditional information

Magnetic volume is in use

Your DB instances are using magnetic storage. Magnetic storage isn't
recommended for most of the DB instances. Choose a different storage type:
General Purpose (SSD) or Provisioned IOPS.

Storage encryption is turned off

Amazon RDS supports encryption at rest for all the database engines by
using the keys that you manage in AWS Key Management Service
(AWS KMS). On an active DB instance with Amazon RDS encryption, the data
stored at rest in the storage is encrypted, similar to automated
backups, read replicas, and snapshots.

If encryption isn't turned on while creating a DB instance, you will
need to create and restore an encrypted copy of the decrypted
snapshot of the DB instance before you turn on the encryption.

Turn on encryption of data at rest for your DB instance.

Yes

`InnoDB_Change_Buffering` parameter using less than
optimum value

Change buffering allows a MySQL DB instance to defer a few writes, which are required to maintain
secondary indexes. This feature was useful in environments with slow
disks. The change buffering configuration improved the DB
performance slightly but caused a delay in crash recovery and long
shutdown times during upgrade. Set to `OFF` by default in
MySQL version 8.4.

Blog

`innodb_stats_persistent` parameter is turned
off

Your DB instance isn't configured to persist the InnoDB statistics to
the disk. When the statistics aren't stored, they are recalculated
each time the instance restarts and the table accessed. This leads
to variations in the query execution plan. You can modify the value
of this global parameter at the table level.

We recommend that you set the `innodb_stats_persistent`
parameter value to `ON`.
