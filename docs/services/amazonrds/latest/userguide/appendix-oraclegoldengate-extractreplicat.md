# Working with the EXTRACT and REPLICAT utilities of Oracle GoldenGate

The Oracle GoldenGate utilities `EXTRACT` and `REPLICAT` work together to keep the
source and target databases in sync via incremental transaction replication using trail
files. All changes that occur on the source database are automatically detected by
`EXTRACT`, then formatted and transferred to trail files on the Oracle GoldenGate
on-premises or Amazon EC2 instance hub. After initial load is completed, the data is read from
these files and replicated to the target database by the `REPLICAT`
utility.

## Running the Oracle GoldenGate EXTRACT utility

The `EXTRACT` utility retrieves, converts, and outputs data from the source
database to trail files. The basic process is as follows:

1. `EXTRACT` queues transaction details to memory or to temporary disk
    storage.

2. The source database commits the transaction.

3. `EXTRACT` writes the transaction details to a trail file.

4. The trail file routes these details to the Oracle GoldenGate on-premises or the Amazon EC2
    instance hub and then to the target database.

The following steps start the `EXTRACT` utility, capture the data from
`EXAMPLE.TABLE` in source database `OGGSOURCE`, and create the
trail files.

###### To run the EXTRACT utility

1. Configure the `EXTRACT` parameter file on the Oracle GoldenGate hub
    (on-premises or Amazon EC2 instance). The following listing shows an example
    `EXTRACT` parameter file named
    `$GGHOME/dirprm/eabc.prm`.

```nohighlight

EXTRACT EABC

USERID oggadm1@OGGSOURCE, PASSWORD "my-password"
EXTTRAIL /path/to/goldengate/dirdat/ab

IGNOREREPLICATES
GETAPPLOPS
TRANLOGOPTIONS EXCLUDEUSER OGGADM1

TABLE EXAMPLE.TABLE;
```

2. On the Oracle GoldenGate hub, log in to the source database and launch the Oracle GoldenGate command
    line interface `ggsci`. The following example shows the format for
    logging in.

```nohighlight

dblogin oggadm1@OGGSOURCE
```

3. Add transaction data to turn on supplemental logging for the database
    table.

```nohighlight

add trandata EXAMPLE.TABLE
```

4. Using the `ggsci` command line, enable the `EXTRACT`
    utility using the following commands.

```nohighlight

add extract EABC tranlog, INTEGRATED tranlog, begin now
add exttrail /path/to/goldengate/dirdat/ab
      extract EABC,
      MEGABYTES 100
```

5. Register the `EXTRACT` utility with the database so that the
    archive logs are not deleted. This task allows you to recover old, uncommitted
    transactions if necessary. To register the `EXTRACT` utility with the
    database, use the following command.

```nohighlight

register EXTRACT EABC, DATABASE
```

6. Start the `EXTRACT` utility with the following command.

```nohighlight

start EABC
```

## Running the Oracle GoldenGate REPLICAT utility

The `REPLICAT` utility "pushes" transaction information in the trail files to the
target database.

The following steps enable and start the `REPLICAT` utility so that it can
replicate the captured data to the table `EXAMPLE.TABLE` in target database
`OGGTARGET`.

###### To run the REPLICATE utility

1. Configure the `REPLICAT` parameter file on the Oracle GoldenGate hub
    (on-premises or EC2 instance). The following listing shows an example
    `REPLICAT` parameter file named
    `$GGHOME/dirprm/rabc.prm`.

```nohighlight

REPLICAT RABC

USERID oggadm1@OGGTARGET, password "my-password"

ASSUMETARGETDEFS
MAP EXAMPLE.TABLE, TARGET EXAMPLE.TABLE;
```

###### Note

Specify a password other than the prompt shown here as a security best practice.

2. Log in to the target database and launch the Oracle GoldenGate command line interface
    ( `ggsci`). The following example shows the format for logging
    in.

```nohighlight

dblogin userid oggadm1@OGGTARGET
```

3. Using the `ggsci` command line, add a checkpoint table. The user indicated
    should be the Oracle GoldenGate user account, not the target table schema owner. The
    following example creates a checkpoint table named
    `gg_checkpoint`.

```nohighlight

add checkpointtable oggadm1.oggchkpt
```

4. To enable the `REPLICAT` utility, use the following command.

```nohighlight

add replicat RABC EXTTRAIL /path/to/goldengate/dirdat/ab CHECKPOINTTABLE oggadm1.oggchkpt
```

5. Start the `REPLICAT` utility by using the following command.

```nohighlight

start RABC
```
