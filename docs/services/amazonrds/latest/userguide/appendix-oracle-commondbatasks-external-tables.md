# Working with external tables in RDS for Oracle

_Oracle external tables_ are tables with data that is not
in the database. Instead, the data is in external files that the database can
access. By using external tables, you can access data without loading it into
the database. For more information about external tables, see [Managing external tables](http://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ADMIN/tables.htm) in the Oracle documentation.

With Amazon RDS, you can store external table files in directory objects. You can
create a directory object, or you can use one that is predefined in the Oracle
database, such as the DATA\_PUMP\_DIR directory. For information about creating
directory objects, see [Creating and dropping directories in the main data storage space](appendix-oracle-commondbatasks-misc.md#Appendix.Oracle.CommonDBATasks.NewDirectories). You can
query the ALL\_DIRECTORIES view to list the directory objects for your Amazon RDS
Oracle DB instance.

###### Note

Directory objects point to the main data storage space (Amazon EBS volume) used
by your instance. The space used—along with data files, redo logs,
audit, trace, and other files—counts against allocated
storage.

You can move an external data file from one Oracle database to another by
using the [DBMS\_FILE\_TRANSFER](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ARPLS/d_ftran.htm) package or the [UTL\_FILE](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ARPLS/u_file.htm) package. The external data file is moved from a directory on the
source database to the specified directory on the destination database. For information
about using `DBMS_FILE_TRANSFER`, see [Importing using Oracle Data Pump](oracle-procedural-importing-datapump.md).

After you move the external data file, you can create an external table with
it. The following example creates an external table that uses the
`emp_xt_file1.txt` file in the USER\_DIR1 directory.

```sql

CREATE TABLE emp_xt (
  emp_id      NUMBER,
  first_name  VARCHAR2(50),
  last_name   VARCHAR2(50),
  user_name   VARCHAR2(20)
)
ORGANIZATION EXTERNAL (
  TYPE ORACLE_LOADER
  DEFAULT DIRECTORY USER_DIR1
  ACCESS PARAMETERS (
    RECORDS DELIMITED BY NEWLINE
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    MISSING FIELD VALUES ARE NULL
    (emp_id,first_name,last_name,user_name)
  )
  LOCATION ('emp_xt_file1.txt')
)
PARALLEL
REJECT LIMIT UNLIMITED;
```

Suppose that you want to move data that is in an Amazon RDS Oracle DB instance into an
external data file. In this case, you can populate the external data file by
creating an external table and selecting the data from the table in the
database. For example, the following SQL statement creates the
`orders_xt` external table by querying the `orders`
table in the database.

```sql

CREATE TABLE orders_xt
  ORGANIZATION EXTERNAL
   (
     TYPE ORACLE_DATAPUMP
     DEFAULT DIRECTORY DATA_PUMP_DIR
     LOCATION ('orders_xt.dmp')
   )
   AS SELECT * FROM orders;
```

In this example, the data is populated in the `orders_xt.dmp` file
in the DATA\_PUMP\_DIR directory.
