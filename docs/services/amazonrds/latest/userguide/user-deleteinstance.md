# Deleting a DB instance

###### Warning

Deleting a database instance permanently removes all its data and can affect related resources. Ensure that you have backed up any important data before proceeding.

You can delete a DB instance using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API. If you want to delete
a DB instance in an Aurora DB cluster, see [Deleting Aurora DB clusters and DB instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_DeleteCluster.html).

## Prerequisites for deleting a DB instance

Before you try to delete your DB instance, make sure that deletion protection is turned off. By
default, deletion protection is turned on for a DB instance that was created with the console.

If your DB instance has deletion protection turned on, you can turn it off by modifying your
instance settings. Choose **Modify** in the database details page or
call the [modify-db-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html) command. This operation doesn't cause an outage.
For more information, see [Settings for DB instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ModifyInstance.Settings.html).

## Considerations when deleting a DB instance

Deleting a DB instance has an effect on instance recoverability, backup availability, and read
replica status. Consider the following issues:

- You can choose whether to create a final DB snapshot. You have the following
options:

- If you take a final snapshot, you can use it to restore your deleted DB instance. RDS retains
both the final snapshot and any manual snapshots that you took
previously. You can't create a final DB snapshot of your DB instance if it isn't in the
`Available` state. For more information, see [Viewing Amazon RDSDB instance status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/accessing-monitoring.html#Overview.DBInstance.Status).

- If you don't take a final snapshot, then no final snapshot exists that you can restore
later. If you decide to restore your deleted DB instance, either retain
automated backups or use an earlier manual snapshot to restore your
DB instance to the point in time of the earlier snapshot.

- You can choose whether to retain automated backups. You have the following options:

- If you retain automated backups, RDS keeps them for the retention period that is in
effect for the DB instance at the time when you delete it. You can use
automated backups to restore your DB instance to a time during but not after
your retention period. The retention period is in effect regardless of
whether you create a final DB snapshot.
To delete a retained automated backup, see [Deleting retained automated backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups-Deleting.html).

- Retained automated backups and manual snapshots incur billing charges until they're deleted. For more information, see
[Retention costs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.Retaining.html#USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.RetentionCosts).

- If you don't retain automated backups, RDS deletes the automated backups that
reside in the same AWS Region as your DB instance. You can't recover these
backups. If your automated backups have been replicated to another
AWS Region, RDS keeps them even if you don't choose to retain
automated backups. For more information, see [Replicating automated backups to another AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReplicateBackups.html).

- When you delete your DB instance, RDS doesn't delete manual DB snapshots. For more
information, see [Creating a DB snapshot for a Single-AZ DB instance for Amazon RDS](user-createsnapshot.md).

- If you want to delete all RDS resources, note that the following resources incur billing
charges:

- DB instances

- DB snapshots

- DB clusters

If you purchased reserved instances, then they are billed according to contract that you
agreed to when you purchased the instance. For more information, see [Reserved DB instances for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithReservedDBInstances.html). You can get billing
information for all your AWS resources by using the AWS Cost Explorer. For more
information, see [Analyzing your costs with AWS Cost Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-what-is.html).

- If you delete a DB instance that has read replicas in the same AWS Region, each
read replica is automatically promoted to a standalone DB instance. For more
information, see [Promoting a read replica to be a standalone DB instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.Promote.html). If your DB instance has read replicas in
different AWS Regions, see [Cross-Region replication considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.XRgn.html#USER_ReadRepl.XRgn.Cnsdr) for information related to
deleting the source DB instance for a cross-Region read replica.

- When the status for a DB instance is `deleting`, its CA certificate value
doesn't appear in the RDS console or in output for AWS CLI commands or RDS
API operations. For more information about CA certificates, see [Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB instance or cluster](usingwithrds-ssl.md).

- The time required to delete a DB instance varies depending on the backup retention period, how
much data is deleted, whether a final snapshot is taken, and whether the final
snapshot is incremental or full. Even if you don't take a final snapshot, the
service must perform internal operations to ensure data consistency. These
operations might extend the delete time. They can't be skipped. The DB instance
status remains in a deleting state until all operations are complete. To reduce
the time required to delete the DB instance, we recommend that you take a manual
snapshot before deleting the DB instance.

## Deleting a DB instance

You can delete a DB instance using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API. You must do the
following:

- Provide the name of the DB instance

- Enable or disable the option to take a final DB snapshot of the
instance

- Enable or disable the option to retain automated backups

###### Note

You can't delete a DB instance when deletion protection is turned on. For more information,
see [Prerequisites for deleting a DB instance](#USER_DeleteInstance.DeletionProtection).

###### To delete a DB instance

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then choose the DB instance that you want to delete.

3. For **Actions**, choose **Delete**.

4. To create a final DB snapshot for the DB instance, choose **Create final snapshot?**.

5. If you chose to create a final snapshot, enter the **Final snapshot name**.

6. To retain automated backups, choose **Retain automated**
**backups**.

7. Enter `delete me` in the box.

8. Choose **Delete**.

To find the instance IDs of the DB instances in your account, call the [describe-db-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.html) command:

```

aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier]' --output text
```

To delete a DB instance by using the AWS CLI, call the [delete-db-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/delete-db-instance.html) command with the following options:

- `--db-instance-identifier`

- `--final-db-snapshot-identifier` or `--skip-final-snapshot`

###### Example With a final snapshot and no retained automated backups

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds delete-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
    --final-db-snapshot-identifier mydbinstancefinalsnapshot \
    --delete-automated-backups
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds delete-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance ^
    --final-db-snapshot-identifier mydbinstancefinalsnapshot ^
    --delete-automated-backups
```

###### Example With retained automated backups and no final snapshot

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds delete-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
    --skip-final-snapshot \
    --no-delete-automated-backups
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds delete-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance ^
    --skip-final-snapshot ^
    --no-delete-automated-backups
```

To delete a DB instance by using the Amazon RDS API, call the [`DeleteDBInstance`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteDBInstance.html) operation with the following parameters:

- `DBInstanceIdentifier`

- `FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier` or `SkipFinalSnapshot`
