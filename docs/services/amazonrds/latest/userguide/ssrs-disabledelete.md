# Disabling and deleting SSRS databases

Use the following procedures to disable SSRS and delete SSRS databases:

###### Topics

- [Turning off SSRS](#SSRS.Disable)

- [Deleting the SSRS databases](#SSRS.Drop)

## Turning off SSRS

To turn off SSRS, remove the `SSRS` option from its option group. Removing the option doesn't delete the SSRS
databases. For more information, see [Deleting the SSRS databases](#SSRS.Drop).

You can turn SSRS on again by adding back the `SSRS` option. If you have also
deleted the SSRS databases, readding the option on the same DB instance creates new
report server databases.

###### To remove the SSRS option from its option group

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Option groups**.

3. Choose the option group with the `SSRS` option ( `ssrs-se-2017` in
    the previous examples).

4. Choose **Delete option**.

5. Under **Deletion options**, choose **SSRS** for
    **Options to delete**.

6. Under **Apply immediately**, choose **Yes** to delete
    the option immediately, or **No** to delete it at
    the next maintenance window.

7. Choose **Delete**.

###### To remove the SSRS option from its option group

- Run one of the following commands.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds remove-option-from-option-group \
      --option-group-name ssrs-se-2017 \
      --options SSRS \
      --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds remove-option-from-option-group ^
      --option-group-name ssrs-se-2017 ^
      --options SSRS ^
      --apply-immediately
```

## Deleting the SSRS databases

Removing the `SSRS` option doesn't delete the report server databases. To
delete them, use the following stored procedure.

To delete the report server databases, be sure to remove the `SSRS` option
first.

###### To delete the SSRS databases

- Use the following stored procedure.

```

exec msdb.dbo.rds_drop_ssrs_databases
```
