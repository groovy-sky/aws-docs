# Connecting from the MySQL command-line client (unencrypted) for RDS for MariaDB

###### Important

Only use an unencrypted MySQL connection when the client and server are in the same VPC
and the network is trusted. For information about using encrypted connections, see
[Connecting to your MariaDB DB instance on Amazon RDS with SSL/TLS from the MySQL command-line client (encrypted)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ConnectToMariaDBInstanceSSL.CLI.html).

To connect to a DB instance using the MySQL command-line client, enter the following command at a
command prompt on a client computer. Doing this connects you to a database on a MariaDB
DB instance. Substitute the DNS name (endpoint) for your DB instance for
`<endpoint>` and the master user name that you used for
`<mymasteruser>`. Provide the master password that
you used when prompted for a password.

```nohighlight

mysql -h <endpoint> -P 3306 -u <mymasteruser> -p
```

After you enter the password for the user, you see output similar to the
following.
