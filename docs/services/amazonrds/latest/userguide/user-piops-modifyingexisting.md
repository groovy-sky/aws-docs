# Increasing DB instance storage capacity

To increase storage capacity for your DB instance, use either of the following
techniques:

**Scale up the storage volume**

Every DB instance has a primary storage volume with a maximum capacity of 64 TiB. You can
increase the allocated space on a storage volume by a minimum of 10%. You
can't deallocate space.

**Add up to three storage volumes (io2 or gp3)**

You can increase the total storage capacity of an RDS for Oracle or RDS for SQL Server instance by adding
up to three volumes to each DB instance. Each additional volume allocates up to 64
TiB of storage, up to a maximum of 256 TiB per instance.

###### Note

For RDS for Oracle DB instances, you can add a storage volume
with the minimum storage size of 200 GiB.

You can use the Amazon RDS Management Console, the Amazon RDS API, or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) for the
preceding techniques. For information about storage limits, see [Amazon RDS DB instance storage](chap-storage.md).
