# Overview of the Performance Insights dashboard

The dashboard is the easiest way to interact with Performance Insights. The following example shows the dashboard for a PostgreSQL DB
instance.

- [Counter metrics chart](#USER_PerfInsights.UsingDashboard.Components.Countermetrics)

- [Database load chart](#USER_PerfInsights.UsingDashboard.Components.AvgActiveSessions)

- [Top dimensions table](#USER_PerfInsights.UsingDashboard.Components.AvgActiveSessions.TopLoadItemsTable)

## Time range filter

By default, the Performance Insights dashboard shows DB load for the last hour. You can adjust this range to be as short as 5 minutes or as
long as 2 years. You can also select a custom relative range.

![Performance Insights relative time](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/perf-insights-relative-time.png)

You can select an absolute range with a beginning and ending date and time. The following example shows the time range beginning at midnight on
9/25/24 and ending at 11:59 PM on 9/28/24.

![Performance Insights absolute time](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/perf-insights-absolute-time.png)

By default, the time zone for the Performance Insights dashboard is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). You can also choose the local time zone.

## Counter metrics chart

With counter metrics, you can customize the Performance Insights dashboard to include up to 10 additional graphs.
These graphs show a selection of dozens of operating system and database performance metrics. You can correlate this
information with DB load to help identify and analyze performance problems.

The **Counter metrics** chart displays data for performance counters. The default
metrics depend on the DB engine:

- MySQL and MariaDB – `db.SQL.Innodb_rows_read.avg`

- Oracle – `db.User.user calls.avg`

- Microsoft SQL Server – `db.Databases.Active Transactions(_Total).avg`

- PostgreSQL – `db.Transactions.xact_commit.avg`

![Counter metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/oracle_perf_insights_counters.png)

To change the performance counters, choose **Manage Metrics**. You can select multiple
**OS metrics** or **Database metrics**, as
shown in the following screenshot. To see details for any metric, hover over the metric name.

For descriptions of the counter metrics that you can add for each DB engine, see [Performance Insights counter metrics](user-perfinsights-counters.md).

## Database load chart

The **Database load** chart shows how the database activity compares to DB instance
capacity as represented by the **Max vCPU** line. By default, the stacked line
chart represents DB load as average active sessions per unit of time. The DB load is sliced (grouped) by wait
states.

### DB load sliced by dimensions

You can choose to display load as active sessions grouped by any supported dimensions. The following table shows
which dimensions are supported for the different engines.

### DB load details for a dimension item

To see details about a DB load item within a dimension, hover over the item name. The following image shows
details for a SQL statement.

![Database load item details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/perf_insights_2c.png)

To see details for any item for the selected time period in the legend, hover over that item.

## Top dimensions table

The Top dimensions table slices DB load by different dimensions. A dimension is a category or "slice by" for
different characteristics of DB load. If the dimension is SQL, **Top SQL** shows the SQL
statements that contribute the most to DB load.

![Top N dimensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/perf_insights_4c.png)

Choose any of the following dimension tabs.
