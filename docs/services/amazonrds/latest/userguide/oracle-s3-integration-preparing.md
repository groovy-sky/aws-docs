# Configuring IAM permissions for RDS for Oracle integration with Amazon S3

For RDS for Oracle to integrate with Amazon S3, your DB instance must have access to an Amazon S3 bucket. The Amazon VPC used by your DB instance doesn't
need to provide access to the Amazon S3 endpoints.

RDS for Oracle supports transferring files between a DB instance in one account and an Amazon S3 bucket in
a different account. Where additional steps are required, they are noted in the following
sections.

###### Topics

- [Step 1: Create an IAM policy for your Amazon RDS role](#oracle-s3-integration.preparing.policy)

- [Step 2: (Optional) Create an IAM policy for your Amazon S3 bucket](#oracle-s3-integration.preparing.policy-bucket)

- [Step 3: Create an IAM role for your DB instance and attach your policy](#oracle-s3-integration.preparing.role)

- [Step 4: Associate your IAM role with your RDS for Oracle DB instance](#oracle-s3-integration.preparing.instance)

## Step 1: Create an IAM policy for your Amazon RDS role

In this step, you create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy with the permissions required to
transfer files between your Amazon S3 bucket and your RDS DB instance. This step assumes that you have
already created an S3 bucket.

Before you create the policy, note the following pieces of information:

- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your bucket

- The ARN for your AWS KMS key, if your bucket uses SSE-KMS or SSE-S3 encryption

###### Note

An RDS for Oracle DB instance can't access Amazon S3 buckets encrypted with SSE-C.

For more information, see [Protecting data using\
server-side encryption](../../../s3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

###### To create an IAM policy to allow Amazon RDS to access your Amazon S3 bucket

01. Open the [IAM Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?).

02. Under **Access management**, choose **Policies**.

03. Choose **Create Policy**.

04. On the **Visual editor** tab, choose **Choose a service**, and then choose
     **S3**.

05. For **Actions**, choose **Expand all**, and then choose the bucket permissions and object
     permissions required to transfer files from an Amazon S3 bucket to Amazon RDS. For example, do the following:

- Expand **List**, and then select **ListBucket**.

- Expand **Read**, and then select **GetObject**.

- Expand **Write**, and then select **PutObject**,
**DeleteObject**, **AbortMultipartUpload**, and **ListMultipartUploadParts**. The multipart upload permissions are required when uploading large files (100 MB or larger) to Amazon S3.

- Expand **Permissions management**, and then select **PutObjectAcl**. This
permission is necessary if you plan to upload files to a bucket owned by a different account, and this account needs
full control of the bucket contents.

_Object permissions_ are permissions for object operations in Amazon S3. You must grant them for
objects in a bucket, not the bucket itself. For more information, see [Permissions for object\
operations](../../../s3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.md#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-objects).

06. Choose **Resources**, and then do the following:
    1. Choose **Specific**.

    2. For **bucket**, choose **Add**
       **ARN**. Enter your bucket ARN. The bucket name is filled
        in automatically. Then choose **Add**.

    3. If the **object** resource is shown, either
        choose **Add ARN** to add resources manually or
        choose **Any**.

       ###### Note

       You can set **Amazon Resource Name (ARN)** to
       a more specific ARN value to allow Amazon RDS to access only specific
       files or folders in an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information about
       how to define an access policy for Amazon S3, see [Managing access\
       permissions to your Amazon S3 resources](../../../s3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.md).
07. (Optional) Choose **Add additional permissions** to add resources to the policy. For example, do the
     following:
    1. If your bucket is encrypted with a custom KMS key, select
        **KMS** for the service.

    2. For **Manual actions**, select the
        following:

- **Encrypt**

- **ReEncrypt from** and
**ReEncrypt to**

- **Decrypt**

- **DescribeKey**

- **GenerateDataKey**

    3. For **Resources**, choose
        **Specific**.

    4. For **key**, choose **Add ARN**.
        Enter the ARN of your custom key as the resource, and then choose
        **Add**.

       For more information, see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys\
        Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)](../../../s3/latest/userguide/usingkmsencryption.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

    5. If you want Amazon RDS to access to access other buckets, add the ARNs
        for these buckets. Optionally, you can also grant access to all
        buckets and objects in Amazon S3.
08. Choose **Next: Tags** and then **Next: Review**.

09. For **Name**, enter a name for your IAM policy, for example `rds-s3-integration-policy`. You
     use this name when you create an IAM role to associate with your DB instance. You can also add an optional
     **Description** value.

10. Choose **Create policy**.

Create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that grants Amazon RDS access to an Amazon S3 bucket. After you create the policy, note the ARN of the
policy. You need the ARN for a subsequent step.

Include the appropriate actions in the policy based on the type of access required:

- `GetObject` – Required to transfer files from an Amazon S3 bucket to Amazon RDS.

- `ListBucket` – Required to transfer files from an Amazon S3 bucket to Amazon RDS.

- `PutObject` – Required to transfer files from Amazon RDS to an Amazon S3 bucket.

- `AbortMultipartUpload` – Required for multipart uploads when transferring large files (100 MB or larger) from Amazon RDS to an Amazon S3 bucket.

- `ListMultipartUploadParts` – Required for multipart uploads when transferring large files (100 MB or larger) from Amazon RDS to an Amazon S3 bucket.

The following AWS CLI command creates an IAM policy named `rds-s3-integration-policy` with
these options. It grants access to a bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws iam create-policy \
   --policy-name rds-s3-integration-policy \
   --policy-document '{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "s3integration",
         "Action": [
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:ListBucket",
           "s3:PutObject",
           "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
           "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
         ],
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket",
           "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }'
```

The following example includes permissions for custom KMS keys.

```nohighlight

aws iam create-policy \
   --policy-name rds-s3-integration-policy \
   --policy-document '{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "s3integration",
         "Action": [
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:ListBucket",
           "s3:PutObject",
           "kms:Decrypt",
           "kms:Encrypt",
           "kms:ReEncrypt*",
           "kms:GenerateDataKey",
           "kms:DescribeKey",
         ],
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket",
           "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*",
           "arn:aws:kms:::your-kms-arn"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }'
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws iam create-policy ^
   --policy-name rds-s3-integration-policy ^
   --policy-document '{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "s3integration",
         "Action": [
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:ListBucket",
           "s3:PutObject",
           "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
           "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
         ],
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket",
           "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }'
```

The following example includes permissions for custom KMS keys.

```nohighlight

aws iam create-policy ^
   --policy-name rds-s3-integration-policy ^
   --policy-document '{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "s3integration",
         "Action": [
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:ListBucket",
           "s3:PutObject",
           "kms:Decrypt",
           "kms:Encrypt",
           "kms:ReEncrypt",
           "kms:GenerateDataKey",
           "kms:DescribeKey",
         ],
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket",
           "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*",
           "arn:aws:kms:::your-kms-arn"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }'
```

## Step 2: (Optional) Create an IAM policy for your Amazon S3 bucket

This step is necessary only in the following conditions:

- You plan to upload files to an Amazon S3 bucket from one account (account A) and access them from a different account (account B).

- Account B owns the bucket.

- Account B needs full control of objects loaded into the bucket.

If the preceding conditions don't apply to you, skip to [Step 3: Create an IAM role for your DB instance and attach your policy](#oracle-s3-integration.preparing.role).

To create your bucket policy, make sure you have the following:

- The account ID for account A

- The user name for account A

- The ARN value for the Amazon S3 bucket in account B

###### To create or edit a bucket policy

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the **Buckets** list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to create a bucket policy for or whose
    bucket policy you want to edit.

3. Choose **Permissions**.

4. Under **Bucket policy**, choose **Edit**. This opens the Edit bucket policy page.

5. On the **Edit bucket policy** page, explore **Policy examples** in the
    _Amazon S3 User Guide_, choose **Policy generator** to generate a policy automatically, or
    edit the JSON in the **Policy** section.

If you choose **Policy generator**, the AWS Policy Generator opens in a new window:
1. On the **AWS Policy Generator** page, in **Select Type of Policy**, choose
       **S3 Bucket Policy**.

2. Add a statement by entering the information in the provided fields, and then choose **Add**
      **Statement**. Repeat for as many statements as you would like to add. For more information about these
       fields, see the [IAM JSON\
       policy elements reference](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-elements.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

      ###### Note

      For convenience, the **Edit bucket policy** page displays the **Bucket ARN**(Amazon Resource Name) of the current bucket above the **Policy** text field. You can
      copy this ARN for use in the statements on the **AWS Policy Generator** page.

3. After you finish adding statements, choose **Generate Policy**.

4. Copy the generated policy text, choose **Close**, and return to the **Edit bucket**
      **policy** page in the Amazon S3 console.
6. In the **Policy** box, edit the existing policy or paste the bucket policy from the Policy generator. Make
    sure to resolve security warnings, errors, general warnings, and suggestions before you save your policy.
JSON

```json

{
     "Version":"2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "ExamplePermissions",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/account-A-user"
         },
         "Action": [
           "s3:PutObject",
           "s3:PutObjectAcl"
         ],
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket",
           "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/*"
         ]
       }
     ]
}

```

7. Choose **Save changes**, which returns you to the Bucket Permissions page.

## Step 3: Create an IAM role for your DB instance and attach your policy

This step assumes that you have created the IAM policy in [Step 1: Create an IAM policy for your Amazon RDS role](#oracle-s3-integration.preparing.policy). In this step, you create a role for your RDS for Oracle DB instance and then attach your
policy to the role.

###### To create an IAM role to allow Amazon RDS to access an Amazon S3 bucket

1. Open the [IAM Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**.

3. Choose **Create role**.

4. Choose **AWS service**.

5. For **Use cases for other AWS services:**, choose
    **RDS** and then **RDS – Add Role to**
**Database**. Then choose **Next**.

6. For **Search** under **Permissions**
**policies**, enter the name of the IAM policy you created in
    [Step 1: Create an IAM policy for your Amazon RDS role](#oracle-s3-integration.preparing.policy), and select the
    policy when it appears in the list. Then choose
    **Next**.

7. For **Role name**, enter a name for your IAM role, for
    example, `rds-s3-integration-role`. You can also add an optional
    **Description** value.

8. Choose **Create role**.

###### To create a role and attach your policy to it

1. Create an IAM role that Amazon RDS can assume on your behalf to access your Amazon S3 buckets.

We recommend using the [`aws:SourceArn`](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-condition-keys.md#condition-keys-sourcearn) and [`aws:SourceAccount`](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-condition-keys.md#condition-keys-sourceaccount) global condition context keys in resource-based trust relationships to limit
    the service's permissions to a specific resource. This is the most effective way to protect against the [confused deputy problem](../../../iam/latest/userguide/confused-deputy.md).

You might use both global condition context keys and have the `aws:SourceArn` value contain the account ID. In
    this case, the `aws:SourceAccount` value and the account in the `aws:SourceArn` value must use the same
    account ID when used in the same statement.

- Use `aws:SourceArn` if you want cross-service access for a single resource.

- Use `aws:SourceAccount` if you want to allow any resource in that account to be associated with the
cross-service use.

In the trust relationship, make sure to use the `aws:SourceArn` global condition context key with the full Amazon
Resource Name (ARN) of the resources accessing the role.

The following AWS CLI command creates the role named `rds-s3-integration-role` for this
purpose.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws iam create-role \
   --role-name rds-s3-integration-role \
   --assume-role-policy-document '{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
            "Service": "rds.amazonaws.com"
          },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Condition": {
             "StringEquals": {
                 "aws:SourceAccount": "my_account_ID",
                 "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:rds:Region:my_account_ID:db:dbname"
             }
         }
       }
     ]
   }'
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws iam create-role ^
   --role-name rds-s3-integration-role ^
   --assume-role-policy-document '{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
            "Service": "rds.amazonaws.com"
          },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Condition": {
             "StringEquals": {
                 "aws:SourceAccount": "my_account_ID",
                 "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:rds:Region:my_account_ID:db:dbname"
             }
         }
       }
     ]
   }'
```

For more information, see [Creating a role to delegate permissions\
to an IAM user](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-user.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

2. After the role is created, note the ARN of the role. You need the ARN for a subsequent step.

3. Attach the policy you created to the role you created.

The following AWS CLI command attaches the policy to the role named
    `rds-s3-integration-role`.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws iam attach-role-policy \
      --policy-arn your-policy-arn \
      --role-name rds-s3-integration-role
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws iam attach-role-policy ^
      --policy-arn your-policy-arn ^
      --role-name rds-s3-integration-role
```

Replace `your-policy-arn` with the policy ARN that you noted in a previous
    step.

## Step 4: Associate your IAM role with your RDS for Oracle DB instance

The last step in configuring permissions for Amazon S3 integration is associating your IAM role with your DB instance. Note the following
requirements:

- You must have access to an IAM role with the required Amazon S3 permissions policy attached to it.

- You can only associate one IAM role with your RDS for Oracle DB instance at a time.

- Your DB instance must be in the **Available** state.

###### To associate your IAM role with your RDS for Oracle DB instance

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose **Databases** from the navigation pane.

3. Choose the RDS for Oracle DB instance name to display its details.

4. On the **Connectivity & security** tab, scroll down to the **Manage IAM roles**
    section at the bottom of the page.

5. For **Add IAM roles to this instance**, choose the role
    that you created in [Step 3: Create an IAM role for your DB instance and attach your policy](#oracle-s3-integration.preparing.role).

6. For **Feature**, choose **S3\_INTEGRATION**.

![Add S3_INTEGRATION role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/ora-s3-integration-role.png)

7. Choose **Add role**.

The following AWS CLI command adds the role to an Oracle DB instance named
`mydbinstance`.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds add-role-to-db-instance \
   --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
   --feature-name S3_INTEGRATION \
   --role-arn your-role-arn
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds add-role-to-db-instance ^
   --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance ^
   --feature-name S3_INTEGRATION ^
   --role-arn your-role-arn
```

Replace `your-role-arn` with the role ARN that you noted in a previous step.
`S3_INTEGRATION` must be specified for the `--feature-name` option.
