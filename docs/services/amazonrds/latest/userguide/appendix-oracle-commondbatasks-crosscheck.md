# Crosschecking archived redo logs

You can crosscheck archived redo logs using the Amazon RDS procedure
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_rman_util.crosscheck_archivelog`.

You can use this procedure to crosscheck the archived redo logs registered in the
control file and optionally delete the expired logs records. When RMAN makes a
backup, it creates a record in the control file. Over time, these records increase
the size of the control file. We recommend that you remove expired records
periodically.

###### Note

Standard Amazon RDS backups don't use RMAN and therefore don't create
records in the control file.

This procedure uses the common parameter `p_rman_to_dbms_output` for
RMAN tasks.

For more information, see [Common parameters for RMAN procedures](appendix-oracle-commondbatasks-commonparameters.md).

This procedure also uses the following additional parameter.

Parameter nameData typeValid valuesDefaultRequiredDescription

`p_delete_expired`

boolean

`TRUE`, `FALSE`

`TRUE`

No

When `TRUE`, delete expired archived redo log
records from the control file.

When `FALSE`, retain the expired archived redo log
records in the control file.

This procedure is supported for the following Amazon RDS for Oracle DB engine versions:

- Oracle Database 21c (21.0.0)

- Oracle Database 19c (19.0.0)

The following example marks archived redo log records in the control file as
expired, but does not delete the records.

```sql

BEGIN
    rdsadmin.rdsadmin_rman_util.crosscheck_archivelog(
        p_delete_expired      => FALSE,
        p_rman_to_dbms_output => FALSE);
END;
/
```

The following example deletes expired archived redo log records from the control
file.

```sql

BEGIN
    rdsadmin.rdsadmin_rman_util.crosscheck_archivelog(
        p_delete_expired      => TRUE,
        p_rman_to_dbms_output => FALSE);
END;
/
```
