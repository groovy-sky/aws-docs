# Copying database metadata from Db2 to Amazon RDS for Db2 with db2look

`db2look` is a native Db2 tool that extracts data definition language (DDL)
files, objects, authorizations, configurations, WLM, and database layouts. You can use
`db2look` to copy database metadata from a self-managed Db2 database to an
Amazon RDS for Db2 database. For more information, see [Mimicking databases using\
db2look](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=tools-db2look) in the IBM Db2 documentation.

###### To copy the database metadata

1. Run the `db2look` tool on your self-managed Db2 system to extract the
    DDL file. In the following example, replace `database_name`
    with the name of your Db2 database.

```nohighlight

db2look -d database_name -e -l -a -f -wlm -cor -createdb -printdbcfg -o db2look.sql
```

2. If your client machine has access to the source (self-managed Db2)
    database and the RDS for Db2 DB instance, you can create the
    `db2look.sql` file on the client machine by directly
    attaching to the remote instance. Then catalog the remote self-managed Db2
    instance.
1. Catalog the node. In the following example, replace
       `dns_ip_address` and
       `port` with the DNS name or the IP address and
       the port number of the self-managed Db2 database.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 catalog tcpip node srcnode REMOTE dns_ip_address server port
      ```

2. Catalog the database. In the following example, replace
       `source_database_name` and
       `source_database_alias` with the name of the
       self-managed Db2 database and the alias that you want to use for this
       database.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 catalog database source_database_name as source_database_alias at node srcnode \
          authentication server_encrypt
      ```

3. Attach to the source database. In the following example, replace
       `source_database_alias`,
       `user_id`, and
       `user_password` with the alias that you created
       in the previous step and the user ID and password for the self-managed Db2
       database.

      ```nohighlight

      db2look -d source_database_alias -i user_id -w user_password -e -l -a -f -wlm \
          -cor -createdb -printdbcfg -o db2look.sql
      ```
3. If you can't access the remote self-managed Db2 database from the client
    machine, copy the `db2look.sql` file to the client machine.
    Then catalog the RDS for Db2 DB
    instance.
1. Catalog the node. In the following example, replace
       `dns_ip_address` and
       `port` with the DNS name or the IP address and
       the port number of the RDS for Db2 DB instance.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 catalog tcpip node remnode REMOTE dns_ip_address server port
      ```

2. Catalog the database. In the following example, replace
       `rds_database_name` and
       `rds_database_alias` with the name of the
       RDS for Db2 database and the alias that you want to use for this
       database.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 catalog database rds_database_name as rds_database_alias at node remnode \
          authentication server_encrypt
      ```

3. Catalog the admin database that manages RDS for Db2. You can't use
       this database to store any data.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 catalog database rdsadmin as rdsadmin at node remnode authentication server_encrypt
      ```
4. Create buffer pools and tablespaces. The administrator doesn't have privileges
    to create buffer pools or tablespaces. However, you can use Amazon RDS stored
    procedures to create them.
1. Find the names and definitions of the buffer pools and tablespaces in the
       `db2look.sql` file.

2. Connect to Amazon RDS using the master username and master password for your
       RDS for Db2 DB instance. In the following example, replace
       `master_username` and
       `master_password` with your own
       information.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 connect to rdsadmin user master_username using master_password
      ```

3. Create a buffer pool by calling `rdsadmin.create_bufferpool`.
       For more information, see [rdsadmin.create\_bufferpool](db2-sp-managing-buffer-pools.md#db2-sp-create-buffer-pool).

      ```nohighlight

      db2 "call rdsadmin.create_bufferpool(
          'database_name',
          'buffer_pool_name',
          buffer_pool_size,
          'immediate',
          'automatic',
          page_size,
          number_block_pages,
          block_size)"
      ```

4. Create a tablespace by calling `rdsadmin.create_tablespace`.
       For more information, see [rdsadmin.create\_tablespace](db2-sp-managing-tablespaces.md#db2-sp-create-tablespace).

      ```nohighlight

      db2 "call rdsadmin.create_tablespace(
          'database_name',
          'tablespace_name',
          'buffer_pool_name',
          tablespace_initial_size,
          tablespace_increase_size,
          'tablespace_type')"
      ```

5. Repeat steps c or d for each additional buffer pool or tablespace
       that you want to add.

6. Terminate your connection.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 terminate
      ```
5. Create tables and objects.
1. Connect to your RDS for Db2 database using the master username and master
       password for your RDS for Db2 DB instance. In the following example, replace
       `rds_database_name`,
       `master_username`, and
       `master_password` with your own
       information.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 connect to rds_database_name user master_username using master_password
      ```

2. Run the `db2look.sql` file.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 -tvf db2look.sql
      ```

3. Terminate your connection.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 terminate
      ```
