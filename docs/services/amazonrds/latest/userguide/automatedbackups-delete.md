# Deleting replicated backups for Amazon RDS

You can delete replicated backups for DB instances using the Amazon RDS console. You can also use the `delete-db-instance-automated-backups` AWS CLI
command or the `DeleteDBInstanceAutomatedBackup` RDS API operation.

Delete replicated backups in the destination Region from the
**Automated backups** page.

###### To delete replicated backups

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose the destination Region from the **Region selector**.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Automated backups**.

4. On the **Replicated backups** tab, choose the DB instance for which you want to delete the
    replicated backups.

5. For **Actions**, choose **Delete**.

6. On the confirmation page, enter `delete me` and choose
    **Delete**.

Delete replicated backups by using the [`delete-db-instance-automated-backup`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/delete-db-instance-automated-backup.html) AWS CLI command.

You can use the [`describe-db-instances`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.html)
CLI command to find the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the replicated backups. For more information, see [Finding information about replicated backups for Amazon RDS](automatedbackups-replicating-describe.md).
