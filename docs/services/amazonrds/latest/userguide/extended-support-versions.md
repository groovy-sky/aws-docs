## Amazon RDS Extended Support version naming

Amazon RDS will release new minor versions with fixes and CVE patches
for engines on RDS Extended Support. For more information, see [Amazon RDS Extended Support versions for RDS for MySQL](mysql-concepts-versionmgmt.md#mysql-extended-support-releases) and [Amazon RDS Extended Support updates for RDS for PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/PostgreSQLReleaseNotes/postgresql-extendedsupport.html) in the _Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL_
_Release Notes_.

The names of these minor releases will be in the form _major.minor-RDS.YYYYMMDD.patch.YYYYMMDD_, for
example, 5.7.44-RDS.20240208.R2.20240210 (for RDS for MySQL) or
11.22-RDS.20240208.R2.20240210 (for RDS for PostgreSQL).

**major**

For MySQL, the major version number is both the integer and the first
fractional part of the version number, for example, 8.0. A major version
upgrade increases the major part of the version number. For example, an
upgrade from 5.7.44 to 8.0.33 is a major version upgrade, where
_5.7_ and _8.0_ are the major version numbers.

For PostgreSQL, the major version number is the integer, for example,
11.

**minor-RDS.YYYYMMDD**

For MySQL, the minor version number is the third part of the version
number, for example, the 44-RDS.20240208 in
5.7.44-RDS.20240208.

For PostgeSQL, the minor version number is the second part of version
number, for example, the 22-RDS.20240208in
11.22-RDS.20240208.

The date is when Amazon RDS created the Amazon RDS minor version.

**patch**

The patch version is what follows the date when Amazon RDS created the
Amazon RDS minor version, for example, the R2 in
5.7.44-RDS.20240208.R2 or
11.22-RDS.20240208.R2.

An Amazon RDS patch version includes important bug fixes added to an Amazon RDS
minor version after its release.

**YYYYMMDD**

The date is when Amazon RDS created the patch version, for example, the
20240210 in 5.7.44-RDS.20240208.R2.20240210 or
11.22-RDS.20240208.R2.20240210.

An Amazon RDS dated version is a security patch that includes important
security fixes added to a minor version after its release. It doesn't
include any fixes that might change an engine's behavior.
