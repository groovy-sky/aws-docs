# Local time zone for Microsoft SQL Server DB instances

The time zone of an Amazon RDS DB instance running Microsoft SQL Server is set by default. The current default is Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC). You can set the time zone of your DB instance to a local time zone instead, to match the time zone of your
applications.

You set the time zone when you first create your DB instance. You can create your DB
instance by using the [AWS Management Console](user-createdbinstance.md), the
Amazon RDS API [CreateDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbinstance.md) action, or the AWS CLI [create-db-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html) command.

If your DB instance is part of a Multi-AZ deployment (using SQL Server DBM or AGs),
then when you fail over, your time zone remains the local time zone that you set. For
more information, see [Multi-AZ deployments using Microsoft SQL Server Database Mirroring or Always On availability groups](chap-sqlserver.md#SQLServer.Concepts.General.Mirroring).

When you request a point-in-time restore, you specify the time to restore to. The time is
shown in your local time zone. For more information, see [Restoring a DB instance to a specified time for Amazon RDS](user-pit.md).

The following are limitations to setting the local time zone on your DB
instance:

- You can't modify the time zone of an existing SQL Server DB instance.

- You can't restore a snapshot from a DB instance in one time zone to a DB
instance in a different time zone.

- We strongly recommend that you don't restore a backup file from one time zone
to a different time zone. If you restore a backup file from one time zone to a
different time zone, you must audit your queries and applications for the
effects of the time zone change. For more information, see [Importing and exporting SQL Server databases using native backup and restore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.Procedural.Importing.html).
