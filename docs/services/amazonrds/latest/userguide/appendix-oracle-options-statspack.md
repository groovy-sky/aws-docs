# Oracle Statspack

The Oracle Statspack option installs and enables the Oracle Statspack performance
statistics feature. Oracle Statspack is a collection of SQL, PL/SQL, and SQL\*Plus
scripts that collect, store, and display performance data. For information about using
Oracle Statspack, see [Oracle Statspack](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13160_01/wli/docs10gr3/dbtuning/statsApdx.html) in the Oracle documentation.

###### Note

Oracle Statspack is no longer supported by Oracle and has been replaced by the
more advanced Automatic Workload Repository (AWR). AWR is available only for Oracle
Enterprise Edition customers who have purchased the Diagnostics Pack. You can use
Oracle Statspack with any Oracle DB engine on Amazon RDS. You can't run Oracle
Statspack on Amazon RDS read replicas.

## Setting up Oracle Statspack

To run Statspack scripts, you must add the Statspack option.

###### To set up Oracle Statspack

1. In a SQL client, log in to the Oracle DB with an administrative
    account.

2. Do either of the following actions, depending on whether Statspack is
    installed:

- If Statspack is installed, and the `PERFSTAT` account
is associated with Statspack, skip to Step 4.

- If Statspack is not installed, and the `PERFSTAT`
account exists, drop the account as follows:

```sql

DROP USER PERFSTAT CASCADE;
```

Otherwise, attempting to add the Statspack option generates an
error and `RDS-Event-0058`.

3. Add the Statspack option to an option group. See [Adding an option to an option group](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.AddOption).

Amazon RDS automatically installs the Statspack scripts on the DB instance and
    then sets up the `PERFSTAT` account.

4. Reset the password using the following SQL statement, replacing _pwd_ with your new password:

```sql

ALTER USER PERFSTAT IDENTIFIED BY pwd ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
```

You can log in using the `PERFSTAT` user account and run the
    Statspack scripts.

5. Grant the `CREATE JOB` privilege to the `PERFSTAT`
    account using the following statement:

```sql

GRANT CREATE JOB TO PERFSTAT;
```

6. Ensure that idle wait events in the `PERFSTAT.STATS$IDLE_EVENT`
    table are populated.

Because of Oracle Bug 28523746, the idle wait events in
    `PERFSTAT.STATS$IDLE_EVENT` may not be populated. To ensure
    all idle events are available, run the following statement:

```sql

INSERT INTO PERFSTAT.STATS$IDLE_EVENT (EVENT)
SELECT NAME FROM V$EVENT_NAME WHERE WAIT_CLASS='Idle'
MINUS
SELECT EVENT FROM PERFSTAT.STATS$IDLE_EVENT;
COMMIT;
```

## Generating Statspack reports

A Statspack report compares two snapshots.

###### To generate Statspack reports

1. In a SQL client, log in to the Oracle DB with the `PERFSTAT` account.

2. Create a snapshot using either of the following techniques:

- Create a Statspack snapshot manually.

- Create a job that takes a Statspack snapshot after a given time interval. For example, the following job creates a Statspack
snapshot every hour:

```sql

VARIABLE jn NUMBER;
exec dbms_job.submit(:jn, 'statspack.snap;',SYSDATE,'TRUNC(SYSDATE+1/24,''HH24'')');
COMMIT;
```

3. View the snapshots using the following query:

```sql

SELECT SNAP_ID, SNAP_TIME FROM STATS$SNAPSHOT ORDER BY 1;
```

4. Run the Amazon RDS procedure `rdsadmin.rds_run_spreport`,
    replacing _begin\_snap_ and _end\_snap_ with the snapshot IDs:

```sql

exec rdsadmin.rds_run_spreport(begin_snap,end_snap);
```

For example, the following command creates a report based on the interval
    between Statspack snapshots 1 and 2:

```sql

exec rdsadmin.rds_run_spreport(1,2);
```

The file name of the Statspack report includes the number of the two
    snapshots. For example, a report file created using Statspack snapshots 1
    and 2 would be named `ORCL_spreport_1_2.lst`.

5. Monitor the output for errors.

Oracle Statspack performs checks before running the report. Therefore, you
    could also see error messages in the command output. For example, you might
    try to generate a report based on an invalid range, where the beginning
    Statspack snapshot value is larger than the ending value. In this case, the
    output shows the error message, but the DB engine does not generate an error
    file.

```sql

exec rdsadmin.rds_run_spreport(2,1);
*
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-20000: Invalid snapshot IDs. Find valid ones in perfstat.stats$snapshot.
```

If you use an invalid number a Statspack snapshot, the output shows an
    error. For example, if you try to generate a report for snapshots 1 and 50,
    but snapshot 50 doesn't exist, the output shows an error.

```sql

exec rdsadmin.rds_run_spreport(1,50);
*
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-20000: Could not find both snapshot IDs
```

6. (Optional)

To retrieve the report, call the trace file procedures, as explained in
    [Working with Oracle trace files](user-logaccess-concepts-oracle.md#USER_LogAccess.Concepts.Oracle.WorkingWithTracefiles).

Alternatively, download the Statspack report from the RDS console. Go to the
    **Log** section of the DB instance details and choose
    **Download**. The following example shows
    `trace/ORCL_spreport_1_2.lst`

![Show a list of Oracle log files in the RDS console. The following trace file is circled: trace/ORCL_spreport_1_2.lst.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/statspack1.png)

If an error occurs while generating a report, the DB engine uses the same
    naming conventions as for a report but with an extension of
    `.err`. For example, if an error occurred while creating
    a report using Statspack snapshots 1 and 7, the report file would be named
    `ORCL_spreport_1_7.err`. You can download the error
    report using the same techniques as for a standard Snapshot report.

## Removing Statspack snapshots

To remove a range of Oracle Statspack snapshots, use the following command:

```sql

exec statspack.purge(begin snap, end snap);
```
