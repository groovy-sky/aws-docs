# MySQL on Amazon RDS versions

For MySQL, version numbers are organized as version = X.Y.Z. In Amazon RDS terminology, X.Y
denotes the major version, and Z is the minor version number. For Amazon RDS implementations, a
version change is considered major if the major version number changes—for example,
going from version 5.7 to 8.0. A version change is considered minor if only the minor
version number changes—for example, going from version 8.0.32 to 8.0.34.

\\* MySQL Community retired major version 5.7 and won't be releasing new minor
versions. This is a minor version that Amazon RDS released with critical security patches and
bug fixes for MySQL 5.7 databases that are covered under RDS Extended Support. For more
information about these minor versions, see [Amazon RDS Extended Support versions for RDS for MySQL](#mysql-extended-support-releases). For more information about RDS Extended Support,
see [Amazon RDS Extended Support with Amazon RDS](extended-support.md).

You can specify any currently supported MySQL version when creating a new DB instance.
You can specify the major version (such as MySQL 5.7), and any supported minor version
for the specified major version. If no version is specified, Amazon RDS defaults to a
supported version, typically the most recent version. If a major version is specified
but a minor version is not, Amazon RDS defaults to a recent release of the major version you
have specified. To see a list of supported versions, as well as defaults for newly
created DB instances, run the [`describe-db-engine-versions`](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-engine-versions.md) AWS CLI command.

For example, to list the supported engine versions for RDS for MySQL, run the following
CLI command:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --engine mysql --query "*[].{Engine:Engine,EngineVersion:EngineVersion}" --output text
```

The default MySQL version might vary by AWS Region. To create a DB instance with a
specific minor version, specify the minor version during DB instance creation. You can
determine the default minor version for an AWS Region by running the following AWS CLI
command:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --default-only --engine mysql --engine-version major_engine_version --region region --query "*[].{Engine:Engine,EngineVersion:EngineVersion}" --output text
```

Replace `major_engine_version` with the major engine version,
and replace `region` with the AWS Region. For example, the
following AWS CLI command returns the default MySQL minor engine version for the 5.7 major
version and the US West (Oregon) AWS Region (us-west-2):

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --default-only --engine mysql --engine-version 5.7 --region us-west-2 --query "*[].{Engine:Engine,EngineVersion:EngineVersion}" --output text
```

With Amazon RDS, you control when to upgrade your MySQL instance to a new major version
supported by Amazon RDS. You can maintain compatibility with specific MySQL versions, test
new versions with your application before deploying in production, and perform major
version upgrades at times that best fit your schedule.

When automatic minor version upgrade is enabled, your DB instance will be upgraded
automatically to new MySQL minor versions as they are supported by Amazon RDS. This patching
occurs during your scheduled maintenance window. You can modify a DB instance to enable
or disable automatic minor version upgrades.

If you opt out of automatically scheduled upgrades, you can manually upgrade to a
supported minor version release by following the same procedure as you would for a major
version update. For information, see [Upgrading a DB instance engine version](user-upgradedbinstance-upgrading.md).

Amazon RDS currently supports the following upgrades for major versions of the MySQL
database engine:

- MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0

- MySQL 8.0 to MySQL 8.4

Because major version upgrades involve some compatibility risk, they do not occur
automatically; you must make a request to modify the DB instance. You should thoroughly
test any upgrade before upgrading your production instances. For information about
upgrading a MySQL DB instance, see [Upgrades of the RDS for MySQL DB engine](user-upgradedbinstance-mysql.md).

You can test a DB instance against a new version before upgrading by creating a DB
snapshot of your existing DB instance, restoring from the DB snapshot to create a new DB
instance, and then initiating a version upgrade for the new DB instance. You can then
experiment safely on the upgraded clone of your DB instance before deciding whether or
not to upgrade your original DB instance.

This release contains patches for the following CVEs:

- [CVE-2024-20963](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-20963)

## Working with the Database Preview environment

In July 2023, Oracle announced a new release model for MySQL. This model includes two
types of releases: Innovation Releases and LTS releases. Amazon RDS makes MySQL Innovation
Releases available in the RDS Preview environment. To learn more about the MySQL
Innovation releases, see [Introducing MySQL Innovation and Long-Term Support (LTS) versions](https://blogs.oracle.com/mysql/post/introducing-mysql-innovation-and-longterm-support-lts-versions).

RDS for MySQL DB instances in the Database Preview environment are functionally similar
to other RDS for MySQL DB instances. However, you can't use the Database Preview
environment for production workloads.

Preview environments have the following limitations:

- Amazon RDS deletes all DB instances 60 days after you create them, along with any
backups and snapshots.

- You can only use General Purpose SSD and Provisioned IOPS SSD storage.

- You can't get help from Support with DB instances. Instead, you can post your questions to the AWS‐managed Q&A
community, [AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/tags/TAsibBK6ZeQYihN9as4S_psg/amazon-relational-database-service).

- You can't copy a snapshot of a DB instance to a production environment.

The following options are supported by the preview.

- You can create DB instances using db.m6i, db.r6i, db.m6g, db.m5, db.t3,
db.r6g, and db.r5 DB instance classes. For more information about RDS instance
classes, see [DB instance classes](concepts-dbinstanceclass.md).

- You can use both single-AZ and multi-AZ deployments.

- You can use standard MySQL dump and load functions to export databases from or
import databases to the Database Preview environment.

### Features not supported in the Database Preview environment

The following features aren't available in the Database Preview
environment:

- Cross-Region snapshot copy

- Cross-Region read replicas

- RDS Proxy

### Creating a new DB instance in the Database Preview environment

You can create a DB instance in the Database Preview environment using the
AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or RDS API.

###### To create a DB instance in the Database Preview environment

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).
