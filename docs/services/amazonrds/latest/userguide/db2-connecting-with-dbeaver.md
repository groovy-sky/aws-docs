# Connecting to your Amazon RDS for Db2 DB instance with DBeaver

You can use third-party tools such as DBeaver to connect to Amazon RDS for Db2 DB
instances. To download this utility, see [DBeaver Community](https://dbeaver.io/).

To connect to your RDS for Db2 DB instance, you need its DNS name and port number. For
information about finding them, see [Finding the endpoint](db2-finding-instance-endpoint.md). You also need to know the
database name, master username, and master password that you defined when you created your
RDS for Db2 DB instance. For more information about finding them, see [Creating a DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.Creating).

###### To connect to an RDS for Db2 DB instance with DBeaver
