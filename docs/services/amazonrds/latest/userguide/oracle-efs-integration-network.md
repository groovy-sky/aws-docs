# Configuring network permissions for RDS for Oracle integration with Amazon EFS

For RDS for Oracle to integrate with Amazon EFS, make sure that your DB instance has network access
to an EFS file system. For more information, see [Controlling network\
access to Amazon EFS file systems for NFS clients](../../../efs/latest/ug/nfs-access-control-efs.md) in the _Amazon Elastic File System User_
_Guide_.

## Controlling network access with security groups

You can control your DB instance access to EFS file systems using network layer
security mechanisms such as VPC security groups. To allow access to an EFS file system
for your DB instance, make sure that your EFS file system meets the following
requirements:

- An EFS mount target exists in every Availability Zone used by an RDS for Oracle
DB instance.

An _EFS mount target_ provides an IP address for an NFSv4
endpoint at which you can mount an EFS file system. You mount your file system
using its DNS name, which resolves to the IP address of the EFS mount target in
the used by the Availability Zone of your DB instance.

You can configure DB instances in different AZs to use the same EFS file system. For
Multi-AZ, you need a mount point for each AZ in your deployment. You might need
to move a DB instance to a different AZ. For these reasons, we recommend that you
create an EFS mount point in each AZ in your VPC. By default, when you create a
new EFS file system using the console, RDS creates mount targets for all
AZs.

- A security group is attached to the mount target.

- The security group has an inbound rule to allow the network subnet or security
group of the RDS for Oracle DB instance on TCP/2049 (Type NFS).

For more information, see [Creating Amazon EFS file systems](../../../efs/latest/ug/creating-using-create-fs.md#configure-efs-network-access) and [Creating and\
managing EFS mount targets and security groups](../../../efs/latest/ug/accessing-fs.md) in the _Amazon Elastic File System_
_User Guide_.

## Controlling network access with file system policies

Amazon EFS integration with RDS for Oracle works with the default (empty) EFS file system policy.
The default policy doesn't use IAM to authenticate. Instead, it grants full access to
any anonymous client that can connect to the file system using a mount target. The
default policy is in effect whenever a user-configured file system policy isn't in
effect, including at file system creation. For more information, see [Default EFS file system policy](../../../efs/latest/ug/iam-access-control-nfs-efs.md#default-filesystempolicy) in the
_Amazon Elastic File System User Guide_.

To strengthen access to your EFS file system for all clients, including RDS for Oracle, you
can configure IAM permissions. In this approach, you create a file system policy. For
more information, see [Creating file system\
policies](../../../efs/latest/ug/create-file-system-policy.md) in the _Amazon Elastic File System User Guide_.
