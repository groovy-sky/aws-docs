# MariaDB on Amazon RDS versions

For MariaDB, version numbers are organized as version X.Y.Z. In Amazon RDS terminology, X.Y
denotes the major version, and Z is the minor version number. For Amazon RDS implementations, a
version change is considered major if the major version number changes, for example going
from version 10.5 to 10.6. A version change is considered minor if only the minor version
number changes, for example going from version 10.6.14 to 10.6.16.

You can specify any currently supported MariaDB version when creating a new DB
instance. You can specify the major version (such as MariaDB 10.5), and any
supported minor version for the specified major version. If no version is specified,
Amazon RDS defaults to a supported version, typically the most recent version. If a
major version is specified but a minor version is not, Amazon RDS defaults to a recent
release of the major version you have specified. To see a list of supported versions,
as well as defaults for newly created DB instances, use the
[`describe-db-engine-versions`](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-engine-versions.md) AWS CLI command.

For example, to list the supported engine versions for RDS for MariaDB, run the following CLI command:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --engine mariadb --query "*[].{Engine:Engine,EngineVersion:EngineVersion}" --output text
```

The default MariaDB version might vary by AWS Region. To create a DB instance with a
specific minor version, specify the minor version during DB instance creation. You can
determine the default minor version for an AWS Region by running the following AWS CLI
command:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --default-only --engine mariadb --engine-version major_engine_version --region region --query "*[].{Engine:Engine,EngineVersion:EngineVersion}" --output text
```

Replace `major_engine_version` with the major engine version,
and replace `region` with the AWS Region. For example, the
following AWS CLI command returns the default MariaDB minor engine version for the 10.5
major version and the US West (Oregon) AWS Region (us-west-2):

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --default-only --engine mariadb --engine-version 10.5 --region us-west-2 --query "*[].{Engine:Engine,EngineVersion:EngineVersion}" --output text
```

## Supported MariaDB major versions on Amazon RDS

RDS for MariaDB major versions remain available at least until community end of life for
the corresponding community version. You can use the following dates to plan your
testing and upgrade cycles. If Amazon extends support for an RDS for MariaDB version for
longer than originally stated, we plan to update this table to reflect the later date.

###### Note

Dates with only a month and a year are approximate and are updated with an exact
date when it’s known.

You can also view information about support dates for major engine versions by
running the [describe-db-major-engine-versions](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-major-engine-versions.md) AWS CLI command or by using the [DescribeDBMajorEngineVersions](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbmajorengineversions.md) RDS API operation.

## Working with the Database Preview environment

RDS for MariaDB DB instances in the Database Preview environment are functionally similar to
other RDS for MariaDB DB instances. However, you can't use the Database Preview environment for
production workloads.

Preview environments have the following limitations:

- Amazon RDS deletes all DB instances 60 days after you create them, along with any
backups and snapshots.

- You can only use General Purpose SSD and Provisioned IOPS SSD storage.

- You can't get help from Support with DB instances. Instead,
you can post your questions to the AWS‐managed Q&A community,
[AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/tags/TAsibBK6ZeQYihN9as4S_psg/amazon-relational-database-service).

- You can't copy a snapshot of a DB instance to a production environment.

The following options are supported by the preview.

- You can create DB instances using db.m6i, db.r6i, db.m6g, db.m5, db.t3, db.r6g,
and db.r5 DB instance classes. For more information about RDS instance classes, see
[DB instance classes](concepts-dbinstanceclass.md).

- You can use both single-AZ and Multi-AZ deployments.

- You can use standard MariaDB dump and load functions to export databases from or
import databases to the Database Preview environment.

### Features not supported in the Database Preview environment

The following features aren't available in the Database Preview environment:

- Cross-Region snapshot copy

- Cross-Region read replicas

- RDS Proxy

### Creating a new DB instance in the Database Preview environment

You can create a DB instance in the Database Preview environment using the AWS Management Console,
AWS CLI, or RDS API.

###### To create a DB instance in the Database Preview environment

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose **Dashboard** from the navigation pane.

3. In the **Dashboard** page, locate the
    **Database Preview Environment** section, as shown
    in the following image.

![The Database Preview Environment section with link in the Amazon RDS console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/preview-environment-dashboard.png)

You can navigate directly to the [Database Preview environment](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/rds-preview/home?region=us-east-2). Before you can proceed, you
    must acknowledge and accept the limitations.

![The Database Preview Environment Service Agreement dialog to acknowledge limitations.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/preview-environment-console.png)

4. To create the RDS for MariaDB DB instance, follow the same process that you
    would for creating any Amazon RDS DB instance. For more information, see the
    [Console](user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.CON) procedure in [Creating a DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.Creating).

To create a DB instance in the Database Preview environment using the AWS CLI,
use the following endpoint.

```nohighlight

rds-preview.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
```

To create the RDS for MariaDB DB instance, follow the same process that you would
for creating any Amazon RDS DB instance. For more information, see the [AWS CLI](user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.CLI) procedure in [Creating a DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.Creating).

To create a DB instance in the Database Preview environment using the RDS API,
use the following endpoint.

```nohighlight

rds-preview.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
```

To create the RDS for MariaDB DB instance, follow the same process that you would
for creating any Amazon RDS DB instance. For more information, see the [RDS API](user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.API) procedure in [Creating a DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.Creating).

## MariaDB version 11.7 in the Database Preview environment

MariaDB version 11.7 is now available in the Amazon RDS Database Preview environment.
MariaDB version 11.7 contains several improvements that are described in [Changes and\
improvements in MariaDB 11.7](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-11-7). This version also includes support for the
vector data type, indexing, and search. For more information, see [Vector Overview](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/vector-overview) in the
MariaDB documentation.

You can use the Database Preview environment to test your workloads against this
release before it is available in all AWS Regions for production workloads. For
information on the Database Preview environment, see [Working with the Database Preview environment](#mariadb-working-with-the-database-preview-environment). To access the
Preview Environment from the console, select [rds-preview/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds-preview).

## Deprecated versions for Amazon RDS for MariaDB

Amazon RDS for MariaDB versions 10.0, 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 are deprecated.

For information about the Amazon RDS deprecation policy for MariaDB, see
[Amazon RDS FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/faqs).
