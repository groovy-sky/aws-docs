# Avoiding performance issues with REPLICA IDENTITY FULL in RDS for PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL logical replication requires each published table to have a _replica_
_identity_ so that the subscriber can locate the correct row to update or delete. By
default, the primary key serves as the replica identity. When a table has no primary key or
suitable unique index, you can set the replica identity to `FULL`, which causes
PostgreSQL to use the entire row as the key.

While `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` solves the immediate problem of replicating tables
without primary keys, it can introduce serious performance issues on both the publisher and
subscriber. Understanding these impacts is important for anyone using logical replication with
RDS for PostgreSQL, including features that rely on logical replication internally, such
as blue/green deployments.

## Why REPLICA IDENTITY FULL causes problems

### Increased WAL volume on the publisher

The `REPLICA IDENTITY` setting controls what information PostgreSQL writes to
the write-ahead log (WAL) to identify rows that are updated or deleted. With the default
replica identity (primary key), only the key columns are logged as the old row identity. With
`FULL`, PostgreSQL records the old values of _every_ column
for each `UPDATE` and `DELETE`. This has several
consequences:

- **WAL size increases significantly.** For updates, the
size of each WAL record roughly doubles because both old and new values for every column are
recorded. If the table contains large values stored using [TOAST](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html),
the increase can be much larger
because TOASTed values must be fetched and written to the WAL even if they were not
modified by the update.

- **Higher I/O and CPU usage on the publisher.** The
additional WAL writes consume more disk I/O bandwidth and CPU cycles, especially for
write-heavy workloads.

- **More data sent to subscribers.** The publisher must
transmit larger WAL records over the network to each subscriber, increasing bandwidth
consumption.

### Slow row lookups on the subscriber

When the subscriber receives an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` log record, it
must find the matching row in its local copy of the table. With `REPLICA IDENTITY
          FULL`, the subscriber searches for a row that matches _all_ column
values from the old row image.

How PostgreSQL performs this search differs by PostgreSQL major version:

- **Before PostgreSQL 16:** If the table has no primary
key and no explicitly configured replica identity index, the subscriber performs a
sequential scan of the entire table for every single `UPDATE` or
`DELETE` operation. On large tables, this makes apply performance extremely
slow.

- **PostgreSQL 16 and later:** The subscriber can use
a btree or hash index for row lookups, even if that index is not explicitly set as
the replica identity. However, the subscriber does not evaluate which index is most
efficient. [Beginning in version 16](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb), PostgreSQL selects the [first suitable index](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/logical-replication-publication.html) it finds, and the user has no control over this
choice. If the selected index has low selectivity (for
example, an index on a boolean or status column), the row lookup can be nearly as slow as
a sequential scan. For this reason, relying on implicit index selection with
`REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` is unreliable and should be considered a fallback,
not a recommended configuration.

### How REPLICA IDENTITY FULL causes replication lag

The two problems described above — larger WAL on the publisher and slower row lookups on
the subscriber — combine to cause replication lag.

By default, PostgreSQL logical replication uses a single _apply worker_
process per subscription to receive changes from the publisher and apply them to the
subscriber's tables. The apply worker processes changes serially, one row at a time, in
commit order. This means the subscriber's throughput is limited by how fast it can apply each
individual change.

When `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` is set on a table without an appropriate index,
every `UPDATE` and `DELETE` requires a sequential scan of the entire
table to find the matching row. If the table has millions of rows, each of these operations
can take seconds or longer. The result is a cascading problem:

1. **The publisher generates changes faster than the subscriber can**
**apply them.** The publisher's write workload continues at normal speed, but the
    subscriber's apply worker is bottlenecked on sequential scans or poorly selective
    indexes for each row lookup.

2. **WAL accumulates on the publisher and can exhaust**
**storage.** PostgreSQL cannot reclaim WAL segments until the subscriber confirms
    it has applied them. As the subscriber falls further behind, the publisher accumulates
    WAL on disk. On RDS for PostgreSQL, this appears as growing
    `OldestReplicationSlotLag` in CloudWatch. In severe cases, this can consume all
    available storage and cause the publisher to stop accepting writes.

3. **The lag is self-reinforcing.** As the subscriber falls
    behind, the table on the subscriber continues to grow from replicated inserts, making
    each sequential scan even slower. Without intervention, the lag grows without
    bound.

This problem is especially severe for tables that receive frequent `UPDATE`
or `DELETE` operations. `INSERT` operations are not affected because
they don't require a row lookup on the subscriber.

###### Note

Starting with PostgreSQL 16, the apply worker can use parallel apply for large
streaming transactions, which can help with throughput. However, the fundamental row-lookup
bottleneck for `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` without indexes remains, because each
individual row still requires a scan to locate.

### Impact on blue/green deployments

Blue/green deployments in Amazon RDS use logical replication internally to keep the green
environment synchronized with the blue environment by setting up a single subscription
per database. The logical replication apply process in
the green environment is _single-threaded_. A single apply worker process
receives all changes from the blue environment and applies them one at a time, in commit
order. There is no parallel apply in the blue/green replication path.

This single-threaded design means the green environment's ability to keep up with the
blue environment depends entirely on how fast that one apply worker can process each
individual change. When tables use `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` without a primary key
or suitable index, the impact on the apply worker depends on the PostgreSQL version. In
versions prior to 16, every `UPDATE` and `DELETE` on those tables
forces the apply worker to perform a sequential scan of the entire table to find the matching
row. In versions 16 and later, PostgreSQL will use a [suitable index](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb) if one is available, but if no qualifying index exists, the apply
worker still falls back to a sequential scan.
While the apply worker is scanning a large table for one row, all other pending changes
across all tables queue up and wait.

The consequences for blue/green deployments are significant:

- **Replication lag grows continuously.** If the blue
environment generates write traffic faster than the single apply worker can process it,
the green environment falls further and further behind. Because the apply worker is
single-threaded, there is no way to parallelize the catch-up.

- **Switchover can be blocked.** A blue/green switchover
requires the green environment to be fully synchronized with the blue environment. If
replication lag is too high, the switchover cannot complete within the timeout
period.

- **The green environment might never catch up.** For
write-heavy workloads with large tables using `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` and no
indexes, the apply rate can be so slow that the green environment falls permanently
behind, making switchover impossible without first resolving the replica identity
configuration.

- **WAL accumulates on the blue environment.** While the
green environment is behind, the blue environment retains WAL segments for the
replication slot. This increases storage usage on the blue (production) environment and
can affect production performance.

To avoid these problems, ensure that all tables have a primary key or a suitable unique
index explicitly configured as the replica identity using `ALTER TABLE ... REPLICA
          IDENTITY USING INDEX` _before_ creating a blue/green deployment.
Don't rely on `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` with implicit index selection in PostgreSQL
16+, because the subscriber might choose a poorly selective index or fall back to sequential
scans. Test the deployment with a representative write workload to confirm the green
environment can keep up.

## How to identify tables using REPLICA IDENTITY FULL

Run the following query to find all tables with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`:

```

SELECT n.nspname AS schema, c.relname AS table_name, c.relreplident
FROM pg_catalog.pg_class c
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace
WHERE c.relkind = 'r'
  AND c.relreplident = 'f'
  AND n.nspname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
ORDER BY n.nspname, c.relname;
```

The `relreplident` column values are:

- `d` — default (primary key)

- `n` — nothing

- `f` — full (entire row)

- `i` — a specific index

## Workarounds and best practices

### Add a primary key wherever possible

The most effective solution is to add a primary key to tables that lack one. When a
primary key exists, PostgreSQL uses it as the default replica identity, which provides
efficient row lookups on the subscriber and minimizes WAL overhead on the publisher.

```

ALTER TABLE my_table ADD COLUMN id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY;
```

###### Important

This statement acquires an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock and rewrites the entire
table, because the default value expression uses `nextval()` which is volatile.
All reads and writes to the table are blocked for the duration of the rewrite. On large
tables, this can cause significant downtime. Plan this change during a maintenance window
or consider alternative approaches such as creating the column as nullable first, then
backfilling and adding the constraint in separate steps.

If adding a primary key is not feasible due to application constraints, consider adding a
unique index on a set of `NOT NULL` columns and setting it as the replica
identity:

```

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX my_table_replica_idx ON my_table (col1, col2);
ALTER TABLE my_table REPLICA IDENTITY USING INDEX my_table_replica_idx;
```

###### Note

To avoid blocking writes while the index is built, use the [`CONCURRENTLY`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html) clause:
`CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY my_table_replica_idx ON my_table (col1,
            col2);`

###### Note

The index used for replica identity must be unique, must not be partial, must not be
deferrable, and must include only columns with `NOT NULL` constraints.

### Don't rely on implicit index selection (PostgreSQL 16+)

Starting with PostgreSQL 16, the subscriber's apply worker can use btree or hash indexes
for row lookups when the replica identity is set to `FULL`, even if those indexes
are not explicitly configured as the replica identity. While this prevents sequential scans
in some cases, relying on this implicit behavior is an anti-pattern for the following
reasons:

- **You don't control which index is chosen.**
PostgreSQL selects the first qualifying index it finds in catalog order, not the most
selective or efficient one. If the table has multiple qualifying indexes, the one chosen
might have low selectivity, leading to poor lookup performance.

- **The behavior is fragile.** Adding, dropping,
or rebuilding indexes can change which index the apply worker uses, potentially causing
unexpected performance regressions in replication.

- **It masks the underlying problem.** Tables
without a primary key or explicit replica identity are inherently risky for logical
replication. Relying on implicit index selection defers the problem rather than solving
it.

Instead, explicitly configure the replica identity for every replicated table:

- **Best option:** Add a primary key. This is the
most reliable and efficient replica identity.

- **Alternative:** Use `ALTER TABLE ...
                REPLICA IDENTITY USING INDEX` to designate a specific unique, non-partial,
non-deferrable index with only `NOT NULL` columns. This gives you explicit
control over which columns are used for row identification.

Reserve `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` only for tables where neither option is
feasible, and understand that performance depends on factors outside your direct
control.

### Monitor replication lag

When using `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`, monitor replication lag closely to detect
subscriber apply slowdowns before they become critical.

**On the publisher**, check the lag between the current WAL
position and what the subscriber has confirmed:

```

SELECT slot_name, confirmed_flush_lsn, pg_current_wal_lsn(),
       (pg_current_wal_lsn() - confirmed_flush_lsn) AS lag_bytes
FROM pg_replication_slots
WHERE slot_type = 'logical';
```

A steadily growing `lag_bytes` value indicates the subscriber is falling
behind. The `pg_stat_replication_slots` view provides additional statistics about
each replication slot's usage.

**On the subscriber**, the
`pg_stat_subscription` view shows the state of each apply worker, including the
last WAL location received and reported:

```

SELECT subname, received_lsn, latest_end_lsn,
       last_msg_send_time, last_msg_receipt_time
FROM pg_stat_subscription;
```

###### Note

On PostgreSQL 16 and later, you can also select `worker_type` to
distinguish between the main apply worker and parallel apply workers.

A large gap between `received_lsn` and `latest_end_lsn`, or stale
timestamps in `last_msg_send_time`, can indicate the apply worker is struggling
to keep up. The `pg_stat_subscription_stats` view also tracks apply errors and
conflicts that might contribute to lag.

**For RDS for PostgreSQL**, you can also monitor the
`OldestReplicationSlotLag` CloudWatch metric, which tracks the lag in bytes of
the most behind replication slot. A rising value is an early warning sign of
replication lag.

**Checking which tables might be using a sub-optimal index during**
**apply**

On the subscriber, you can identify tables where the apply worker is performing excessive
heap reads, which can indicate that the table doesn't have an efficient index for row lookups
during apply. Run the following query on the subscriber:

```

SELECT relname, heap_blks_read, heap_blks_hit,
       idx_blks_read, idx_blks_hit,
       heap_blks_read + heap_blks_hit AS total_heap_access
FROM pg_statio_user_tables
WHERE heap_blks_read > 0
ORDER BY heap_blks_read DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

A table with a high `heap_blks_read` value relative to
`idx_blks_read` can indicate that the apply worker is not using an efficient index
to locate rows for `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations. This is a common
source of replication lag when `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` is in use.

###### Note

This query requires the [`track_counts`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-statistics.html) parameter to be enabled on the subscriber. This
parameter is on by default.

### Evaluate whether REPLICA IDENTITY FULL is necessary

Before setting `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`, consider whether you truly need it.
Common reasons for using it include:

- The table has no primary key or unique index.

- You need the full before-image of rows for change data capture (CDC)
consumers.

- You need TOASTed column values included in replication events for updates
that don't modify those columns.

If your only reason is the lack of a primary key, adding one is almost always the better
path. If you need full before-images for CDC, consider whether your CDC consumer can
reconstruct full rows by maintaining state externally, which avoids the WAL and subscriber
overhead of `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`.
