# Renaming a Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server database in a Multi-AZ deployment

To rename a Microsoft SQL Server database instance that uses Multi-AZ, use the following procedure:

1. First, turn off Multi-AZ for the DB instance.

2. Rename the database by running `rdsadmin.dbo.rds_modify_db_name`.

3. Then, turn on Multi-AZ Mirroring or Always On Availability Groups for the DB instance, to return it to its original state.

For more information, see [Adding Multi-AZ to a Microsoft SQL Server DB instance](user-sqlservermultiaz.md#USER_SQLServerMultiAZ.Adding).

###### Note

If your instance doesn't use Multi-AZ, you don't need to change any settings before or after running `rdsadmin.dbo.rds_modify_db_name`.

You can't rename a database on a read replica source instance.

**Example:** In the following example, the
`rdsadmin.dbo.rds_modify_db_name` stored procedure renames a database from
`MOO` to `ZAR`. This is similar to running the
statement `DDL ALTER DATABASE [MOO] MODIFY NAME =
			[ZAR]`.

```sql

EXEC rdsadmin.dbo.rds_modify_db_name N'MOO', N'ZAR'
GO
```
