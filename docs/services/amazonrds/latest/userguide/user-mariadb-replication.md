# Working with MariaDB replication in Amazon RDS

You usually use read replicas to configure replication between Amazon RDS DB instances. For
general information about read replicas, see [Working with DB instance read replicas](user-readrepl.md). For specific information about working with read
replicas on Amazon RDS for MariaDB, see [Working with MariaDB read replicas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_MariaDB.Replication.ReadReplicas.html).

You can also configure replication based on binary log coordinates for a
MariaDB DB instance. For MariaDB instances, you can also configure replication based on
global transaction IDs (GTIDs), which provides better crash safety.
For more information, see
[Configuring GTID-based replication with an external source instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MariaDB.Procedural.Replication.GTID.html).

The following are other replication options available with RDS for MariaDB:

- You can set up replication between an RDS for MariaDB DB instance and a MySQL or
MariaDB instance that is external to Amazon RDS. For information about configuring
replication with an external source, see [Configuring binary log file position replication with an external source instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Procedural.Importing.External.ReplMariaDB.html).

- You can configure replication to import databases from a MySQL or MariaDB instance that is external to Amazon RDS, or to export
databases to such instances. For more information, see [Importing data to an Amazon RDS for MariaDB DB instance with reduced downtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/mariadb-importing-data-reduced-downtime.html) and [Exporting data from a MySQL DB instance by using replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Procedural.Exporting.NonRDSRepl.html).

For any of these replication options, you can use either row-based replication, statement-based, or mixed replication. Row-based replication
only replicates the changed rows that result from a SQL statement. Statement-based replication replicates the entire SQL statement. Mixed replication
uses statement-based replication when possible, but switches to row-based replication when SQL statements that are unsafe for statement-based replication
are run. In most cases, mixed replication is recommended. The binary log format of the DB instance determines whether replication is row-based,
statement-based, or mixed. For information about setting the binary log format, see [Configuring MariaDB binary logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.MariaDB.BinaryFormat.html).

For information about replication compatibility between MariaDB versions, see [Replication Compatibility](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-vs-mysql-compatibility) in the MariaDB documentation.
