# Preparing to create an Oracle replica

Before you can begin using your replica, perform the following tasks.

- [Changing your logging configuration](#oracle-read-replicas.configuration.logging-config)

## Enabling automatic backups

Before a DB instance can serve as a source DB instance, make sure to enable automatic backups on the source
DB instance. To learn how to perform this procedure, see [Enabling automated backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.Enabling.html).

## Enabling force logging mode

We recommend that you enable force logging mode. In force logging mode, the Oracle database writes redo
records even when `NOLOGGING` is used with data definition language (DDL) statements.

###### To enable force logging mode

1. Log in to your Oracle database using a client tool such as SQL Developer.

2. Enable force logging mode by running the following procedure.

```

exec rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.force_logging(p_enable => true);
```

For more information about this procedure, see [Setting force logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.Oracle.CommonDBATasks.Log.html#Appendix.Oracle.CommonDBATasks.SettingForceLogging).

## Changing your logging configuration

For _n_ online redo logs of size _m_, RDS
automatically creates _n_ +1 standby logs of size
_m_ on the primary DB instance and all replicas. Whenever you change
the logging configuration on the primary, the changes propagate automatically to the
replicas.

If you change your logging configuration, consider the following guidelines:

- We recommend that you complete the changes before making a DB instance the source
for replicas. RDS for Oracle also supports updating the instance after it becomes a
source.

- Before you change the logging configuration on the primary DB instance, check that
each replica has enough storage to accommodate the new configuration.

You can modify the logging configuration for a DB instance by using the Amazon RDS procedures
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.add_logfile` and
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.drop_logfile`. For more information, see [Adding online redo logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.Oracle.CommonDBATasks.Log.html#Appendix.Oracle.CommonDBATasks.RedoLogs) and [Dropping online redo logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.Oracle.CommonDBATasks.Log.html#Appendix.Oracle.CommonDBATasks.DroppingRedoLogs).

## Setting the MAX\_STRING\_SIZE parameter

Before you create an Oracle replica, ensure that the setting of the `MAX_STRING_SIZE` parameter
is the same on the source DB instance and the replica. You can do this by associating them with the same
parameter group. If you have different parameter groups for the source and the replica, you can set
`MAX_STRING_SIZE` to the same value. For more information about setting this parameter, see
[Turning on extended data types for a new DB instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Oracle.Concepts.ExtendedDataTypes.html#Oracle.Concepts.ExtendedDataTypes.CreateDBInstance).

## Planning compute and storage resources

Ensure that the source DB instance and its replicas are sized properly, in terms of compute and storage, to
suit their operational load. If a replica reaches compute, network, or storage resource capacity, the replica
stops receiving or applying changes from its source. Amazon RDS for Oracle doesn't intervene to mitigate high
replica lag between a source DB instance and its replicas. You can modify the storage and CPU resources of a
replica independently from its source and other replicas.
