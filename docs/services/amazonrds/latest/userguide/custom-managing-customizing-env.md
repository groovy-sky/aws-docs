# Customizing your RDS Custom environment

###### Note

End of support notice: On March 31, 2027, AWS will end support for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. After March 31, 2027, you will no longer be able to access the RDS Custom for Oracle console or RDS Custom for Oracle resources. For more information, see [RDS Custom for Oracle end of support](rds-custom-for-oracle-end-of-support.md).

RDS Custom for Oracle includes built-in features that allow you to customize your DB instance environment
without pausing automation. For example, you can use RDS APIs to customize your environment
as follows:

- Create and restore DB snapshots to create a clone environment.

- Create read replicas.

- Modify storage settings.

- Change the CEV to apply release updates

For some customizations, such as changing the character set, you can't use the RDS APIs.
In these cases, you need to change the environment manually by accessing your Amazon EC2 instance
as the root user or logging in to your Oracle database as `SYSDBA`.

To customize your instance manually, you must pause and resume RDS Custom automation. This
pause ensures that your customizations don't interfere with RDS Custom automation. In this way,
you avoid breaking the support perimeter, which places the instance in the
`unsupported-configuration` state until you fix the underlying issues.
Pausing and resuming are the only supported automation tasks when you modify an RDS Custom for Oracle
DB instance.

## General steps for customizing your RDS Custom environment

To customize your RDS Custom DB instance, complete the following steps:

1. Pause RDS Custom automation for a specified period using the console or CLI.

2. Identify your underlying Amazon EC2 instance.

3. Connect to your underlying Amazon EC2 instance using SSH keys or AWS Systems Manager.

4. Verify your current configuration settings at the database or operating system
    layer.

You can validate your changes by comparing the initial configuration to the
    changed configuration. Depending on the type of customization, use OS tools or
    database queries.

5. Customize your RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance as needed.

6. Reboot your instance or database, if required.

###### Note

In an on-premises Oracle CDB, you can preserve a specified open mode for
PDBs using a built-in command or after a startup trigger. This mechanism
brings PDBs to a specified state when the CDB restarts. When opening your
CDB, RDS Custom automation discards any user-specified preserved states and
attempts to open all PDBs. If RDS Custom can't open all PDBs, the following
event is issued: `The following PDBs failed to open:
                                   list-of-PDBs`.

7. Verify your new configuration settings by comparing them with the previous
    settings.

8. Resume RDS Custom automation in either of the following ways:

- Resume automation manually.

- Wait for the pause period to end. In this case, RDS Custom resumes
monitoring and instance recovery automatically.

9. Verify the RDS Custom automation framework

If you followed the preceding steps correctly, RDS Custom starts an automated
    backup. The status of the instance in the console shows
    **Available**.

For best practices and step-by-step instructions, see the AWS blog posts [Make configuration changes to an Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle instance: Part 1](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/part-1-make-configuration-changes-to-an-amazon-rds-custom-for-oracle-instance)
and [Recreate an Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle database: Part 2](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/part-2-recreate-an-amazon-rds-custom-for-oracle-database).

## Pausing and resuming your RDS Custom DB instance

You can pause and resume automation for your DB instance using the console or CLI.

###### To pause or resume RDS Custom automation

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then choose the RDS Custom DB instance that you
    want to modify.

3. Choose **Modify**. The **Modify DB instance** page appears.

4. For **RDS Custom automation mode**, choose one of the following options:

- **Paused** pauses the monitoring and instance
recovery for the RDS Custom DB instance. Enter the pause duration
that you want (in minutes) for **Automation mode**
**duration**. The minimum value is 60 minutes
(default). The maximum value is 1,440 minutes.

- **Full automation** resumes automation.

5. Choose **Continue** to check the summary of modifications.

A message indicates that RDS Custom will apply the changes immediately.

6. If your changes are correct, choose **Modify DB instance**. Or choose
    **Back** to edit your changes or **Cancel** to cancel your
    changes.

On the RDS console, the details for the modification appear. If you paused automation, the
    **Status** of your RDS Custom DB instance indicates **Automation**
**paused**.

7. (Optional) In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then your
    RDS Custom DB instance.

In the **Summary** pane, **RDS Custom automation mode**
    indicates the automation status. If automation is paused, the value is **Paused.**
**Automation resumes in `num` minutes**.

To pause or resume RDS Custom automation, use the `modify-db-instance` AWS CLI command. Identify the DB
instance using the required parameter `--db-instance-identifier`. Control the automation mode with the
following parameters:

- `--automation-mode` specifies the pause state of the DB instance. Valid values are
`all-paused`, which pauses automation, and `full`, which resumes
it.

- `--resume-full-automation-mode-minutes` specifies the duration of the pause. The
default value is 60 minutes.

###### Note

Regardless of whether you specify `--no-apply-immediately` or `--apply-immediately`, RDS Custom
applies modifications asynchronously as soon as possible.

In the command response, `ResumeFullAutomationModeTime` indicates the resume time as a UTC timestamp. When
the automation mode is `all-paused`, you can use `modify-db-instance` to resume automation mode or
extend the pause period. No other `modify-db-instance` options are supported.

The following example pauses automation for `my-custom-instance` for 90 minutes.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier my-custom-instance \
    --automation-mode all-paused \
    --resume-full-automation-mode-minutes 90
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier my-custom-instance ^
    --automation-mode all-paused ^
    --resume-full-automation-mode-minutes 90
```

The following example extends the pause duration for an extra 30 minutes. The 30 minutes is added to
the original time shown in `ResumeFullAutomationModeTime`.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier my-custom-instance \
    --automation-mode all-paused \
    --resume-full-automation-mode-minutes 30
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier my-custom-instance ^
    --automation-mode all-paused ^
    --resume-full-automation-mode-minutes 30
```

The following example resumes full automation for `my-custom-instance`.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier my-custom-instance \
    --automation-mode full \
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier my-custom-instance ^
    --automation-mode full
```

In the following partial sample output, the pending `AutomationMode` value is
`full`.
