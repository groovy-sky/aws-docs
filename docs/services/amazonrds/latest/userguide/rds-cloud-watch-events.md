# Creating a rule that triggers on an Amazon RDS event

Using Amazon EventBridge, you can automate AWS services and respond to system events such as application
availability issues or resource changes.

## Creating rules to send Amazon RDS events to Amazon EventBridge

You can write simple rules to indicate which Amazon RDS events interest you and which automated actions to take when an event matches a rule. You
can set a variety of targets, such as an AWS Lambda function or an Amazon SNS topic, which receive events in JSON format. For example, you can configure
Amazon RDS to send events to Amazon EventBridge whenever a DB
instance is created or deleted. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events) and the [Amazon EventBridge User Guide](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide.md).

###### To create a rule that triggers on an RDS event:

01. Open the CloudWatch console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

02. Under **Events** in the navigation pane, choose **Rules**.

03. Choose **Create rule**.

04. For **Event Source**, do the following:
    1. Choose **Event Pattern**.

    2. For **Service Name**, choose **Relational Database Service (RDS)**.

    3. For **Event Type**, choose the type of Amazon RDS resource that triggers the event. For example, if a DB instance triggers the event, choose **RDS DB Instance Event**.
05. For **Targets**, choose **Add Target** and choose the AWS service that is to act when an event of the
     selected type is detected.

06. In the other fields in this section, enter information specific to this target type, if any is needed.

07. For many target types, EventBridge needs permissions to send events to the target. In these cases, EventBridge can create the IAM role needed for
     your event to run:

- To create an IAM role automatically, choose **Create a new role for this specific resource**.

- To use an IAM role that you created before, choose **Use existing role**.

08. Optionally, repeat steps 5-7 to add another target for this rule.

09. Choose **Configure details**. For **Rule definition**, type a name and description for the rule.

    The rule name must be unique within this Region.

10. Choose **Create rule**.

For more information, see [Creating an\
EventBridge Rule That Triggers on an Event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/Create-CloudWatch-Events-Rule.html) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

## Tutorial: Log DB instance state changes using Amazon EventBridge

In this tutorial, you create an AWS Lambda function that logs the state changes for an Amazon RDS instance.
You then create a rule that runs the function whenever there is a state change of an existing RDS DB instance. The tutorial assumes that you
have a small running test instance that you can shut down temporarily.

###### Important

Don't perform this tutorial on a running production DB instance.

- [Step 2: Create a rule](#rds-create-rule)

- [Step 3: Test the rule](#rds-test-rule)

### Step 1: Create an AWS Lambda function

Create a Lambda function to log the state change events. You specify this function when you create your rule.

###### To create a Lambda function

1. Open the AWS Lambda console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda).

2. If you're new to Lambda, you see a welcome page. Choose **Get Started Now**. Otherwise, choose **Create**
**function**.

3. Choose **Author from scratch**.

4. On the **Create function** page, do the following:
1. Enter a name and description for the Lambda function. For example, name the function `RDSInstanceStateChange`.

2. In **Runtime**, select **Node.js 16x**.

3. For **Architecture**, choose **x86\_64**.

4. For **Execution role**, do either of the following:

- Choose **Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions**.

- For **Existing role**, choose **Use an existing role**. Choose the role that you want to use.

5. Choose **Create function**.
5. On the **RDSInstanceStateChange** page, do the following:
1. In **Code source**, select **index.js**.

2. In the **index.js** pane, delete the existing code.

3. Enter the following code:

      ```

      console.log('Loading function');

      exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
          console.log('Received event:', JSON.stringify(event));
      };
      ```

4. Choose **Deploy**.

### Step 2: Create a rule

Create a rule to run your Lambda function whenever you launch an Amazon RDS instance.

###### To create the EventBridge rule

01. Open the Amazon EventBridge console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Rules**.

03. Choose **Create rule**.

04. Enter a name and description for the rule. For example, enter `RDSInstanceStateChangeRule`.

05. Choose **Rule with an event pattern**, and then choose **Next**.

06. For **Event source**, choose **AWS events or EventBridge partner events**.

07. Scroll down to the **Event pattern** section.

08. For **Event source**, choose **AWS services**.

09. For **AWS service**, choose **Relational Database Service (RDS)**.

10. For **Event type**, choose **RDS DB Instance Event**.

11. Leave the default event pattern. Then choose **Next**.

12. For **Target types**, choose **AWS service**.

13. For **Select a target**, choose **Lambda function**.

14. For **Function**, choose the Lambda function that you created. Then choose **Next**.

15. In **Configure tags**, choose **Next**.

16. Review the steps in your rule. Then choose **Create rule**.

### Step 3: Test the rule

To test your rule, shut down an RDS DB instance. After waiting a few minutes for the instance to shut down, verify that your Lambda function
was invoked.

###### To test your rule by stopping a DB instance

01. Open the Amazon RDS console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

02. Stop an RDS DB instance.

03. Open the Amazon EventBridge console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events).

04. In the navigation pane, choose **Rules**, choose the name of the rule that you created.

05. In **Rule details**, choose **Monitoring**.

    You are redirected to the Amazon CloudWatch console. If you are not redirected, click **View the metrics in CloudWatch**.

06. In **All metrics**, choose the name of the rule that you created.

    The graph should indicate that the rule was invoked.

07. In the navigation pane, choose **Log groups**.

08. Choose the name of the log group for your Lambda function
     ( **/aws/lambda/ `function-name`**).

09. Choose the name of the log stream to view the data provided by the function for the instance that you launched. You should see a received
     event similar to the following:

    ```

    {
        "version": "0",
        "id": "12a345b6-78c9-01d2-34e5-123f4ghi5j6k",
        "detail-type": "RDS DB Instance Event",
        "source": "aws.rds",
        "account": "111111111111",
        "time": "2021-03-19T19:34:09Z",
        "region": "us-east-1",
        "resources": [
            "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:111111111111:db:testdb"
        ],
        "detail": {
            "EventCategories": [
                "notification"
            ],
            "SourceType": "DB_INSTANCE",
            "SourceArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:111111111111:db:testdb",
            "Date": "2021-03-19T19:34:09.293Z",
            "Message": "DB instance stopped",
            "SourceIdentifier": "testdb",
            "EventID": "RDS-EVENT-0087"
        }
    }
    ```

    For more examples of RDS events in JSON format, see [Overview of events for Amazon RDS](working-with-events.md#rds-cloudwatch-events.sample).

10. (Optional) When you're finished, you can open the Amazon RDS console and start the instance that you stopped.
