# Using GTID-based replication

The following content explains how to use global transaction identifiers (GTIDs) with
binary log (binlog) replication among Amazon RDS for MySQL DB
instances.

If you use binlog replication and aren't familiar with GTID-based replication with MySQL,
see [Replication\
with global transaction identifiers](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-gtids.html) in the MySQL documentation.

GTID-based replication is supported for the following
versions:

- All RDS for MySQL 8.4 versions

- All RDS for MySQL 8.0 versions

- All RDS for MySQL 5.7 versions

All MySQL DB instances in a replication configuration must meet this
version requirement.

## Overview of global transaction identifiers (GTIDs)

_Global transaction identifiers (GTIDs)_ are unique
identifiers generated for committed MySQL transactions. You can use GTIDs to make binlog
replication simpler and easier to troubleshoot.

MySQL uses two different types of transactions for binlog replication:

- _GTID transactions_ – Transactions that are identified by a GTID.

- _Anonymous transactions_ – Transactions that
don't have a GTID assigned.

In a replication configuration, GTIDs are unique across all DB instances. GTIDs simplify
replication configuration because when you use them, you don't have to refer to log
file positions. GTIDs also make it easier to track replicated transactions and determine
whether the source instance and replicas are consistent.

You can use GTID-based replication to replicate data with RDS for MySQL
read replicas. You can configure GTID-based replication when you are creating new read replicas, or you can
convert existing read replicas to use GTID-based replication.

You can also use GTID-based replication in a delayed replication configuration with RDS for MySQL. For more information,
see [Configuring delayed replication with MySQL](user-mysql-replication-readreplicas-delayreplication.md).

## Parameters for GTID-based replication

Use the following parameters to configure GTID-based replication.

ParameterValid valuesDescription

`gtid_mode`

`OFF`, `OFF_PERMISSIVE`,
`ON_PERMISSIVE`, `ON`

`OFF` specifies that new transactions are anonymous
transactions (that is, don't have GTIDs), and a transaction
must be anonymous to be replicated.

`OFF_PERMISSIVE` specifies that new transactions
are anonymous transactions, but all transactions can be
replicated.

`ON_PERMISSIVE` specifies that new transactions are
GTID transactions, but all transactions can be replicated.

`ON` specifies that new transactions are GTID
transactions, and a transaction must be a GTID transaction to be
replicated.

`enforce_gtid_consistency`

`OFF`, `ON`, `WARN`

`OFF` allows transactions to violate GTID
consistency.

`ON` prevents transactions from violating GTID
consistency.

`WARN` allows transactions to violate GTID
consistency but generates a warning when a violation occurs.

###### Note

In the AWS Management Console, the `gtid_mode` parameter appears as `gtid-mode`.

For GTID-based replication, use these settings for the parameter
group for your DB instance or read replica:

- `ON` and `ON_PERMISSIVE` apply only to outgoing replication
from an RDS DB instance. Both of these values cause your RDS DB instance to
use GTIDs for transactions that are replicated. `ON` requires that
the target database also use GTID-based replication. `ON_PERMISSIVE`
makes GTID-based replication optional on the target database.

- `OFF_PERMISSIVE`, if set, means that your RDS DB instances can accept
incoming replication from a source database. They can do this regardless of
whether the source database uses GTID-based replication.

- `OFF`, if set, means that your RDS DB instance only accepts incoming replication
from source databases that don't use GTID-based replication.
