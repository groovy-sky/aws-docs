# Removing additional storage volumes

You can remove additional storage volumes from RDS for Oracle and RDS for SQL Server DB instances when they are no
longer needed. Before removing a volume, make sure that you have moved all database
files off the volume and that no database objects are referencing it. Verify that the
volume status is `Not-in-use`.

###### Important

You can't remove the primary storage volume. You can only remove additional storage volumes.

###### To remove an additional storage volume from a DB instance

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Databases**.

3. Choose the DB instance that includes the volume that you want to remove.

4. Choose **Modify**.

5. In the **Storage** section, locate the additional storage volume that you want to remove.

6. Choose **Remove volume** for the volume you want to delete.

###### Note

You can only remove volumes with a status of `Not-in-use`. If the volume is
still in use, move all database files off the volume.

7. Choose **Continue**.

8. When the settings are as you want them, choose **Modify DB**
**instance**.

To remove an additional storage volume from a DB instance, use the AWS CLI command [`modify-db-instance`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html). Set the following
parameter:

- `--additional-storage-volumes` – JSON array specifying the remaining additional storage volumes. Omit the volume you want to remove from this array.

The following example removes the additional storage volume named `rdsdbdata3`
from `mydbinstance` by specifying only the remaining volumes and
applies the change immediately.

```

aws rds modify-db-instance \
	--db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
	--additional-storage-volumes '[{ \
		"VolumeName": "rdsdbdata3", \
		"SetForDelete": true
	}]'
```

To remove an additional storage volume from a DB instance, use the Amazon RDS API operation [`ModifyDBInstance`](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbinstance.md). Set the following
parameters:

- `AdditionalStorageVolumes` – Array of additional storage volume specifications for the volumes you want to keep. Omit the volume you want to remove from this array.

- `ApplyImmediately` – Set this option to
`True` to apply the storage changes immediately. Set
this option to `False` (the default) to apply the changes
during the next maintenance window.
