# Connecting to your Amazon RDS for Db2 DB instance with IBM CLPPlus

You can use a utility such as IBM CLPPlus to connect to an Amazon RDS for Db2 DB instance. This
utility is part of IBM Data Server Runtime Client. To download the
clientfrom IBM Fix Central, see [IBM Data Server\
Client Packages Version 11.5 Mod 8 Fix Pack 0](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6830885) in IBM Support.

###### Important

We recommend that you run IBM CLPPlus on an operating system that supports graphical
user interfaces such as macOS, Windows, or
Linux with Desktop. If running headless Linux, use
switch **-nw** with CLPPlus commands.

- [Retrieving CLOB Data from DB2 Stored Procedures](#db2-connecting-ibm-clpplus-retrieve-clob-data)

## Installing the client

After downloading the package for Linux, install the client.

###### Note

To install the client on AIX or Windows, follow the
same procedure but modify the commands for your operating system.

###### To install the client on Linux

1. Run **`./db2_install`**.

2. Run **`clientInstallDir/instance/db2icrt**
**-s client` `instance_name`**. Replace
    `instance_name` with a valid operating system user
    on Linux. In Linux, the Db2 DB instance name is
    tied to the operating system username.

This command creates a **`sqllib`**
    directory in the home directory of the designated user on Linux.

## Connecting to a DB instance

To connect to your RDS for Db2 DB instance, you need its DNS name and port number. For
information about finding them, see [Finding the endpoint](db2-finding-instance-endpoint.md). You also need to know the
database name, master username, and master password that you defined when you created
your RDS for Db2 DB instance. For more information about finding them, see [Creating a DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.Creating).

###### To connect to an RDS for Db2 DB instance with IBM CLPPlus

1. Review the command syntax. In the following example, replace
    `clientDir` with the location where the client is
    installed.

```nohighlight

cd clientDir/bin
       ./clpplus -h
```

2. Configure your Db2 server. In the following example, replace
    `dsn_name`,
    `database_name`,
    `endpoint`, and `port`
    with the DSN name, database name, endpoint, and port for your RDS for Db2 DB
    instance. For more information, see [Finding the endpoint of your Amazon RDS for Db2 DB instance](db2-finding-instance-endpoint.md).

```non

db2cli writecfg add -dsn dsn_name -database database_name -host endpoint -port port -parameter "Authentication=SERVER_ENCRYPT"
```

3. Connect to your RDS for Db2 DB instance. In the following example, replace
    `master_username` and
    `dsn_name` with the master username and DSN
    name.

```nohighlight

./clpplus -nw master_username@dsn_name
```

4. A Java Shell window opens. Enter the master password for your
    RDS for Db2 DB instance.

###### Note

If a Java Shell window doesn't open, run `./clpplus -nw` to use the same command
line window.

```nohighlight

Enter password: *********
```

A connection is made and produces output similar to the following
    example:

```nohighlight

Database Connection Information :
   ---------------------------------
Hostname = database-1.abcdefghij.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
Database server = DB2/LINUXX8664  SQL110590
SQL authorization ID = admin
Local database alias = DB2DB
Port = 50000
```

5. Run queries and view results. The following example shows a SQL statement that
    selects the database you created.

```sql

SQL > select current server from sysibm.dual;
```

This command produces output similar to the following example:

```sql

1
       --------------------
       DB2DB
       SQL>
```

## Retrieving CLOB Data from DB2 Stored Procedures

Stored procedures like rdsadmin.db2pd\_command return results in CLOB columns, which support up to 2 GB of data. However, DB2 CLP limits CLOB output to 8 KB (8192 bytes), truncating any data beyond this threshold. To retrieve the complete output, use CLPPLUS instead.

1. Get Task ID (task\_id)

```nohighlight

db2 "select task_id, task_type, database_name, lifecycle, varchar(bson_to_json(task_input_params), 500) as task_params,
cast(task_output as varchar(500)) as task_output, CREATED_AT, LAST_UPDATED_AT from table(rdsadmin.get_task_status(null,null,null))"
```

2. Execute CLPPLUS Command

After obtaining the task\_id, execute the following command from the Unix prompt (replace TASK\_ID with the actual numeric task ID):

```nohighlight

$ (echo "select task_output from table(rdsadmin.get_task_status(task_id,null,null));" ; echo "disconnect;" ; echo "exit;") | clpplus -nw -silent masteruser/MasterUserPassword@hostname:port_num/rdsadmin
```
