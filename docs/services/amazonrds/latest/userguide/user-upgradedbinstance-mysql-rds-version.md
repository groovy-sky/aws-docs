# RDS version numbers in RDS for MySQL

RDS version numbers use either the
`major.minor.patch`
or the
`major.minor.patch.YYYYMMDD`
naming scheme. Amazon RDS Extended Support versions use the `minor-RDS.YYYYMMDD`
minor version naming scheme.

An RDS patch version includes important bug fixes added to a minor version after its
release. An RDS date version ( `YYYYMMDD`) is a security patch.
A security patch doesn't include any fixes that might change the engine's behavior. For
information about RDS Extended Support version numbering, see [Amazon RDS Extended Support version naming](extended-support-versions.md#extended-support-naming).

You can find out the RDS version number of your RDS for MySQL database with the following
SQL query:

```sql

mysql> select mysql.rds_version();
```

For example, querying an RDS for MySQL 8.0.34 database returns the following
output:

```nohighlight

+---------------------+
| mysql.rds_version() |
+---------------------+
| 8.0.34.R2.20231201  |
+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```
