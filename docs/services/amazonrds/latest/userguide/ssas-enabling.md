# Turning on SSAS

Use the following process to turn on SSAS for your DB instance:

1. Create a new option group, or choose an existing option group.

2. Add the `SSAS` option to the option group.

3. Associate the option group with the DB instance.

4. Allow inbound access to the virtual private cloud (VPC) security group for the SSAS
    listener port.

5. Turn on Amazon S3 integration.

## Creating an option group for SSAS

Use the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI to create an option group that corresponds to the SQL
Server engine and version of the DB instance that you plan to use.

###### Note

You can also use an existing option group if it's for the correct SQL Server engine
and version.

The following console procedure creates an option group for SQL Server Standard Edition
2017.

###### To create the option group

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Option groups**.

3. Choose **Create group**.

4. In the **Create option group** pane, do the following:
1. For **Name**, enter a name for the option group that is unique
       within your AWS account, such as
       `ssas-se-2017`. The name can
       contain only letters, digits, and hyphens.

2. For **Description**, enter a brief description of the option group, such as `SSAS option group
                                                  for SQL Server SE 2017`. The description is used for display purposes.

3. For **Engine**, choose **sqlserver-se**.

4. For **Major engine version**, choose
       **14.00**.
5. Choose **Create**.

The following CLI example creates an option group for SQL Server Standard Edition
2017.

###### To create the option group

- Use one of the following commands.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-option-group \
      --option-group-name ssas-se-2017 \
      --engine-name sqlserver-se \
      --major-engine-version 14.00 \
      --option-group-description "SSAS option group for SQL Server SE 2017"
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-option-group ^
      --option-group-name ssas-se-2017 ^
      --engine-name sqlserver-se ^
      --major-engine-version 14.00 ^
      --option-group-description "SSAS option group for SQL Server SE 2017"
```

## Adding the SSAS option to the option group

Next, use the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI to add the `SSAS` option to the option
group.

###### To add the SSAS option

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Option groups**.

3. Choose the option group that you just created.

4. Choose **Add option**.

5. Under **Option details**, choose
    **SSAS** for **Option**
**name**.

6. Under **Option settings**, do the following:

1. For **Max memory**, enter a value in
       the range 10–80.

      **Max memory** specifies the upper threshold above which SSAS begins
       releasing memory more aggressively to make room for requests that are running, and also new
       high-priority requests. The number is a percentage of the total memory of the DB instance. The
       allowed values are 10–80, and the default is 45.

2. For **Mode**, choose the SSAS server mode, **Tabular** or
       **Multidimensional**.

      If you don't see the **Mode** option setting, it means that Multidimensional
       mode isn't supported in your AWS Region. For more information, see [Limitations](appendix-sqlserver-options-ssas.md#SSAS.Limitations).

      **Tabular** is the default.

3. For **Security groups**, choose the VPC security group to associate with the
       option.

###### Note

The port for accessing SSAS, 2383, is prepopulated.

7. Under **Scheduling**, choose whether to add the
    option immediately or at the next maintenance window.

8. Choose **Add option**.

###### To add the SSAS option

1. Create a JSON file, for example `ssas-option.json`, with the following parameters:

- `OptionGroupName` – The name of option group that you created or
chose previously ( `ssas-se-2017` in the
following example).

- `Port` – The port that you use to access SSAS. The only supported
port is 2383.

- `VpcSecurityGroupMemberships` – Memberships for VPC security groups
for your RDS DB instance.

- `MAX_MEMORY` – The upper threshold above which SSAS should begin
releasing memory more aggressively to make room for
requests that are running, and also new high-priority
requests. The number is a percentage of the total memory
of the DB instance. The allowed values are 10–80,
and the default is 45.

- `MODE` – The SSAS server mode, either `Tabular` or
`Multidimensional`. `Tabular` is the default.

If you receive an error that the `MODE` option
setting isn't valid, it means that Multidimensional mode
isn't supported in your AWS Region. For more
information, see [Limitations](appendix-sqlserver-options-ssas.md#SSAS.Limitations).

The following is an example of a JSON file with SSAS option settings.

```nohighlight

{
"OptionGroupName": "ssas-se-2017",
"OptionsToInclude": [
	{
	"OptionName": "SSAS",
	"Port": 2383,
	"VpcSecurityGroupMemberships": ["sg-0abcdef123"],
	"OptionSettings": [{"Name":"MAX_MEMORY","Value":"60"},{"Name":"MODE","Value":"Multidimensional"}]
	}],
"ApplyImmediately": true
}
```

2. Add the `SSAS` option to the option group.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds add-option-to-option-group \
       --cli-input-json file://ssas-option.json \
       --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds add-option-to-option-group ^
       --cli-input-json file://ssas-option.json ^
       --apply-immediately
```

## Associating the option group with your DB instance

You can use the console or the CLI to associate the option group with your DB
instance.

Associate your option group with a new or existing DB instance:

- For a new DB instance, associate the option group with the DB instance when you launch
the instance. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md).

- For an existing DB instance, modify the instance and associate the new option group with
it. For more information, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

###### Note

If you use an existing instance, it must already have an Active Directory domain and
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role associated with it. If you create a new
instance, specify an existing Active Directory domain and IAM
role. For more information, see [Working with Active Directory with RDS for SQL Server](user-sqlserver-activedirectorywindowsauth.md).

You can associate your option group with a new or existing DB instance.

###### Note

If you use an existing instance, it must already have an Active Directory domain and IAM role associated with it. If you create
a new instance, specify an existing Active Directory domain and IAM role. For more information, see
[Working with Active Directory with RDS for SQL Server](user-sqlserver-activedirectorywindowsauth.md).

###### To create a DB instance that uses the option group

- Specify the same DB engine type and major version that you used when creating the option group.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance \
      --db-instance-identifier myssasinstance \
      --db-instance-class db.m5.2xlarge \
      --engine sqlserver-se \
      --engine-version 14.00.3223.3.v1 \
      --allocated-storage 100 \
      --manage-master-user-password \
      --master-username admin \
      --storage-type gp2 \
      --license-model li \
      --domain-iam-role-name my-directory-iam-role \
      --domain my-domain-id \
      --option-group-name ssas-se-2017
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance ^
      --db-instance-identifier myssasinstance ^
      --db-instance-class db.m5.2xlarge ^
      --engine sqlserver-se ^
      --engine-version 14.00.3223.3.v1 ^
      --allocated-storage 100 ^
      --manage-master-user-password ^
      --master-username admin ^
      --storage-type gp2 ^
      --license-model li ^
      --domain-iam-role-name my-directory-iam-role ^
      --domain my-domain-id ^
      --option-group-name ssas-se-2017
```

###### To modify a DB instance to associate the option group

- Use one of the following commands.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
      --db-instance-identifier myssasinstance \
      --option-group-name ssas-se-2017 \
      --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance ^
      --db-instance-identifier myssasinstance ^
      --option-group-name ssas-se-2017 ^
      --apply-immediately
```

## Allowing inbound access to your VPC security group

Create an inbound rule for the specified SSAS listener port in the VPC security group associated with your DB instance.
For more information about setting up security groups, see [Provide access to your DB instance in your VPC by creating a security group](chap-settingup.md#CHAP_SettingUp.SecurityGroup).

## Enabling Amazon S3 integration

To download model configuration files to your host for deployment, use Amazon S3 integration. For
more information, see [Integrating an Amazon RDS for SQL Server DB instance with Amazon S3](user-sqlserver-options-s3-integration.md).
