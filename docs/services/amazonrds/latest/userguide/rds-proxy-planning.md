# Planning where to use RDS Proxy

You can determine which of your DB instances, clusters, and applications might benefit the most from using
RDS Proxy. To do so, consider these factors:

- Any DB instance
that encounters "too many connections" errors is a good candidate
for associating with a proxy. This is often characterized by a high value of the
`ConnectionAttempts` CloudWatch metric. The proxy enables applications to open many client connections, while the
proxy manages a smaller number of long-lived connections to the DB instance
.

- For DB instances that use smaller AWS instance classes, such as T2 or T3, using a proxy can
help avoid out-of-memory conditions. It can also help reduce the CPU overhead for establishing
connections. These conditions can occur when dealing with large numbers of connections.

- You can monitor certain Amazon CloudWatch metrics to determine whether a DB instance is approaching
certain types of limit. These limits are for the number of connections and the memory associated with
connection management. You can also monitor certain CloudWatch metrics to determine whether a DB instance
is handling many short-lived connections. Opening and closing such connections can impose
performance overhead on your database. For information about the metrics to monitor, see
[Monitoring RDS Proxy metrics with Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.monitoring.html).

- AWS Lambda functions can also be good candidates for using a proxy. These functions make frequent short
database connections that benefit from connection pooling offered by RDS Proxy. You can take advantage of
any IAM authentication you already have for Lambda functions, instead of managing database credentials in
your Lambda application code.

- Applications that typically open and close large numbers of database
connections and don't have built-in connection pooling mechanisms are good
candidates for using a proxy.

- Applications that keep a large number of connections open for long periods are typically good candidates
for using a proxy. Applications in industries such as software as a service (SaaS) or ecommerce often
minimize the latency for database requests by leaving connections open. With RDS Proxy, an application can
keep more connections open than it can when connecting directly to the DB
instance.

- You might not have adopted IAM authentication and Secrets Manager due to the complexity of setting up such
authentication for all DB instances
. The proxy can enforce the authentication policies for client
connections for particular applications. You can take advantage of any IAM
authentication you already have for Lambda functions, instead of managing database credentials in your
Lambda application code.

- RDS Proxy can help make applications more resilient and transparent to database failures. RDS Proxy bypasses Domain Name System (DNS) caches
to reduce failover times by up to 66% for Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instances.
RDS Proxy also automatically routes traffic to a new database instance while preserving application connections. This makes failovers more transparent
for applications.
