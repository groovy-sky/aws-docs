# How to perform a major version upgrade for RDS for PostgreSQL

We recommend the following process when performing a major version upgrade on
an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database:

01. **Have a version-compatible parameter**
    **group ready** – If you are using a
     custom parameter group, you have two options. You can
     specify a default parameter group for the new DB engine
     version. Or you can create your own custom parameter group
     for the new DB engine version. For more information, see
     [Parameter groups for Amazon RDS](user-workingwithparamgroups.md) and
     [Working with DB cluster parameter groups for Multi-AZ DB clusters](user-workingwithdbclusterparamgroups.md).

02. **Check for unsupported database**
    **classes** – Check that your
     database's instance class is compatible with the
     PostgreSQL version you are upgrading to. For more
     information, see [Supported DB engines for DB instance classes](concepts-dbinstanceclass-support.md).

03. **Check for unsupported**
    **usage:**

- **Prepared**
**transactions** – Commit or roll
back all open prepared transactions before
attempting an upgrade.

You can use the following query to verify that
there are no open prepared transactions on your
database.

```sql

SELECT count(*) FROM pg_catalog.pg_prepared_xacts;
```

- **Reg\* data**
**types** – Remove all uses of the
_reg\*_ data types before
attempting an upgrade. Except for
`regtype` and `regclass`,
you can't upgrade the _reg\*_
data types. The `pg_upgrade` utility
can't persist this data type, which is used by
Amazon RDS to do the upgrade.

To verify that there are no uses of
unsupported _reg\*_ data types,
use the following query for each database.

```sql

SELECT count(*) FROM pg_catalog.pg_class c, pg_catalog.pg_namespace n, pg_catalog.pg_attribute a
    WHERE c.oid = a.attrelid
        AND NOT a.attisdropped
        AND a.atttypid IN ('pg_catalog.regproc'::pg_catalog.regtype,
                           'pg_catalog.regprocedure'::pg_catalog.regtype,
                           'pg_catalog.regoper'::pg_catalog.regtype,
                           'pg_catalog.regoperator'::pg_catalog.regtype,
                           'pg_catalog.regconfig'::pg_catalog.regtype,
                           'pg_catalog.regdictionary'::pg_catalog.regtype)
        AND c.relnamespace = n.oid
        AND n.nspname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema');

```

04. **Check for invalid**
    **databases:**

- Ensure there are no invalid databases. The
`datconnlimit` column in the
`pg_database` catalog includes a value
of `-2` to mark databases as invalid
that were interrupted during a `DROP
                                                    DATABASE` operation.

Use the following query to check for invalid
databases:

```sql

SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datconnlimit = - 2;
```

- The previous query returns invalid database
names. You can use `DROP DATABASE
                                                    invalid_db_name;`
to drop invalid databases. You can also use the
following command to drop invalid
databases:

```sql

SELECT 'DROP DATABASE ' || quote_ident(datname) || ';' FROM pg_database WHERE datconnlimit = -2 \gexec
```

For more information about invalid databases, see [Understanding the behavior of autovacuum with\
invalid databases](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-autovacuumbehavior.md).

05. **Handle logical replication**
    **slots** – An upgrade can't
     occur if the database has any logical replication slots.
     Logical replication slots are typically used for AWS DMS
     migration and for replicating tables from the database to
     data lakes, BI tools, and other targets. Before upgrading,
     make sure that you know the purpose of any logical
     replication slots that are in use, and confirm that
     it's okay to delete them. If the logical replication
     slots are still being used, you shouldn't delete them,
     and you can't proceed with the upgrade.

    If the logical replication slots aren't needed, you can
     delete them using the following SQL:

    ```sql

    SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots WHERE slot_type NOT LIKE 'physical';
    SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot(slot_name);
    ```

    Logical replication setups that use the `pglogical`
     extension also need to have slots dropped for a successful
     major version upgrade. For information about how to identify
     and drop slots created using the `pglogical`
     extension, see [Managing logical replication slots for RDS for PostgreSQL](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-pglogical-handle-slots.md).

    On source version 17 and later, logical replication slots on non-read-replicas can be retained through upgrades. Logical replication slots created on read replicas are not retained through upgrades.

    Ensure that all transactions and logical decoding messages have been consumed from the slot before initiating the upgrade. If there are unconsumed write-ahead log files (WAL) held by logical replication slots, the upgrade will fail with a message identifying the problem slots. See the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-upgrade.html) for further details.

    On Multi-AZ clusters with source versions earlier than 17.8 or 18.2, ensure that `flow_control` is disabled. For more information, see [Turning on and turning off flow control for Multi-AZ DB clusters](multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.md#multi-az-db-clusters-concepts-replica-lag). You can turn off flow control by removing the extension from the `shared_preload_libraries` and rebooting your DB instance.

06. **Handle read replicas** –
     An upgrade of a Single-AZ DB instance or Multi-AZ DB instance deployment
     also upgrades the in-Region read replicas
     along with the primary DB instance. Amazon RDS doesn't upgrade Multi-AZ DB cluster
     read replicas.

    You can't upgrade read replicas separately. If you could,
     it could lead to situations where the primary and replica
     databases have different PostgreSQL major versions. However,
     read replica upgrades might increase downtime on the primary
     DB instance. To prevent a read replica upgrade, promote the
     replica to a standalone instance or delete it before
     starting the upgrade process.

    The upgrade process recreates the read replica's
     parameter group based on the read replica's current
     parameter group. You can apply a custom parameter group to a
     read replica only after the upgrade completes by modifying
     the read replica. For more information about read replicas,
     see [Working with read replicas for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](user-postgresql-replication-readreplicas.md).

07. **Handle large objects** – In PostgreSQL, large objects (also known as BLOBs) are used to store and manage large binary objects (like files, images, videos, etc.) that are larger than the maximum size allowed for regular column data types. For more information see [PostgreSQL Large Objects documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/largeobjects.html).

    An upgrade can run out of memory and fail if there are millions of large objects and the instance cannot handle them during an upgrade. The PostgreSQL major version upgrade process comprises of two broad phases: dumping the schema via pg\_dump and restoring it through pg\_restore. If your database has millions of large objects you need to ensure your instance has sufficient memory to handle the pg\_dump and pg\_restore during an upgrade and scale it to a larger instance type.

    Before you begin an upgrade, check if your database is having any large objects. The catalog `pg_largeobject_metadata` holds metadata associated with large objects. The actual large object data is stored in `pg_largeobject`. Use the following query to check for the number of large objects:

    ```

    SELECT count(*) FROM pg_largeobject_metadata;
    ```

    To cleanup existing large objects or orphaned large objects, see [Managing large objects with the lo module](../aurorauserguide/postgresql-large-objects-lo-extension.md).

    When planning a major version upgrade, we recommend using an instance type with at least 32 GB of memory if your database contains 25 to 30 million large objects. This recommendation is based on our tests and can vary depending on your specific workload and database configuration. If your database includes additional objects (such as tables, indexes, or materialized views), we recommend selecting a larger instance type to ensure optimal performance during the upgrade process.

08. **Handle zero-ETL integrations**
     – If you have an existing [zero-ETL integration](zero-etl.md), [delete it](zero-etl-deleting.md) before
     performing a major version upgrade. Then, after completing
     the upgrade, recreate the integration.

    On source versions majors 17 and up, the zero-ETL integration can be retained through the upgrade.

09. **Perform a backup** – We
     recommend that you perform a backup before performing the
     major version upgrade so that you have a known restore point
     for your database. If your backup retention period is
     greater than 0, the upgrade process creates DB snapshots of
     your database before and after upgrading. To change your
     backup retention period, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md) and
     [Modifying a Multi-AZ DB cluster for Amazon RDS](modify-multi-az-db-cluster.md).

    To perform a backup manually, see [Creating a DB snapshot for a Single-AZ DB instance for Amazon RDS](user-createsnapshot.md) and [Creating a Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshot for Amazon RDS](user-createmultiazdbclustersnapshot.md).

10. **Upgrade certain extensions before a**
    **major version upgrade** – If you
     plan to skip a major version with the upgrade, you need to
     update certain extensions _before_
     performing the major version upgrade. For example, upgrading
     from versions 9.5.x or 9.6.x to version 11.x skips a major
     version. The extensions to update include PostGIS and
     related extensions for processing spatial data.

- `address_standardizer`

- `address_standardizer_data_us`

- `postgis_raster`

- `postgis_tiger_geocoder`

- `postgis_topology`

You cannot directly upgrade to PostgreSQL version 17 if you
are using `rdkit` version 4.6.0 and lower, and
PostgreSQL version 16 and lower, due to `rdkit`
incompatibility. Below are the upgrade options:

- If you are on PostgreSQL version 13 and lower,
you need to perform a major version upgrade to
version 14.14 and higher 14 versions, 15.9 and
higher 15 versions, or 16.5 and higher 16 versions
first, and then perform the version upgrade to
PostgreSQL 17.

- If you are on PostgreSQL version 14, 15, or
16, you need to perform a minor version upgrade to
14.14 and higher 14 versions, 15.9 and higher 15
versions, or 16.5 and higher 16 versions, and then
upgrade to PostgreSQL version 17.

Run the following command for each extension that you're
using:

```sql

ALTER EXTENSION PostgreSQL-extension UPDATE TO 'new-version';
```

For more information, see [Upgrading PostgreSQL extensions in RDS for PostgreSQL databases](user-upgradedbinstance-postgresql-extensionupgrades.md). To learn more about upgrading PostGIS, see [Step 6: Upgrade the PostGIS extension](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-postgis.md#Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.PostGIS.Update).

11. **Drop certain extensions before the major**
    **version upgrade** – Extensions that are not supported on the target version must be dropped, or else the upgrade will fail.

    The `plrust` extension is removed starting in RDS PostgreSQL 18. The `postgis_topology` extension is unavailable on RDS PostgreSQL versions 18.1 and 18.2 due to known issues \[ [1](https://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/ticket/5983)\], \[ [2](https://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/ticket/6016)\]. These extensions must be removed prior to upgrading.

    An upgrade that
     skips a major version to version 11.x doesn't support
     updating the `pgRouting` extension. Upgrading
     from versions 9.4.x, 9.5.x, or 9.6.x to versions 11.x skips
     a major version. It's safe to drop the
     `pgRouting` extension and then reinstall
     it to a compatible version after the upgrade. For the
     extension versions you can update to, see [Supported PostgreSQL extension versions](postgresql-concepts-general-featuresupport-extensions.md).

    The `tsearch2` and `chkpass` extensions
     are no longer supported for PostgreSQL versions 11 or later.

    You can check if an extension is installed with the following query:

    ```sql

    SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname in ('extension_name');
    ```

12. **Drop unknown data types**
     – Drop `unknown` data types depending on
     the target version.

    PostgreSQL version 10 stopped supporting the
     `unknown` data type. If a version 9.6
     database uses the `unknown` data type, an upgrade
     to a version 10 shows an error message such as the
     following:

    ```

    Database instance is in a state that cannot be upgraded: PreUpgrade checks failed:
    The instance could not be upgraded because the 'unknown' data type is used in user tables.
    Please remove all usages of the 'unknown' data type and try again."
    ```

    To find the `unknown` data type in your database so
     you can remove the offending column or change it to a
     supported data type, use the following SQL:

    ```

    SELECT DISTINCT data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE data_type ILIKE 'unknown';
    ```

13. **Perform an upgrade dry run**
     – We highly recommend testing a major version upgrade
     on a duplicate of your production database before attempting
     the upgrade on your production database. You can monitor the
     execution plans on the duplicate test database for any
     possible execution plan regressions and to evaluate its
     performance. To create a duplicate test instance, you can
     either restore your database from a recent snapshot or do a
     point-in-time restore of your database to its latest
     restorable time.

    For more information, see [Restoring from a snapshot](user-restorefromsnapshot.md#USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.Restoring) or
     [Restoring a DB instance to a specified time for Amazon RDS](user-pit.md). For Multi-AZ DB clusters, see [Restoring from a snapshot to a Multi-AZ DB cluster](user-restorefrommultiazdbclustersnapshot-restoring.md) or [Restoring a Multi-AZ DB cluster to a specified time](user-pit-multiazdbcluster.md).

    For details on performing the upgrade, see [Manually upgrading the engine version](user-upgradedbinstance-upgrading.md#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.Manual).

    In upgrading a version 9.6 database to version 10, be aware
     that PostgreSQL 10 enables parallel queries by default. You
     can test the impact of parallelism
     _before_ the upgrade by changing
     the `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` parameter
     on your test database to 2.

    ###### Note

    The default value for
    `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`
    parameter in the `default.postgresql10`
    DB parameter group is 2.

    For more information, see [Parallel Query](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/parallel-query.html) in the PostgreSQL
     documentation. To disable parallelism on version 10, set the
     `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`
     parameter to 0.

    During the major version upgrade, the `public` and
     `template1` databases and the
     `public` schema in every database are
     temporarily renamed. These objects appear in the logs with
     their original name and a random string appended. The string
     is appended so that custom settings such as
     `locale` and `owner` are
     preserved during the major version upgrade. After the
     upgrade completes, the objects are renamed back to their
     original names.

    ###### Note

    During the major version upgrade process, you can't do
    a point-in-time restore of your DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster.
    After Amazon RDS performs the upgrade, it takes an
    automatic backup of the database. You can perform a
    point-in-time restore to times before the upgrade
    began and after the automatic backup of your
    database has completed.

14. **If an upgrade fails with precheck**
    **procedure errors, resolve the issues**
     – During the major version upgrade process, Amazon RDS for
     PostgreSQL first runs a precheck procedure to identify any
     issues that might cause the upgrade to fail. The precheck
     procedure checks all potential incompatible conditions
     across all databases in the instance.

    If the precheck encounters an issue, it creates a log event
     indicating the upgrade precheck failed. The precheck process
     details are in an upgrade log named
     `pg_upgrade_precheck.log` for all the
     databases of a database. Amazon RDS appends a timestamp to the
     file name. For more information about viewing logs, see
     [Monitoring Amazon RDS log files](user-logaccess.md).

    If a read replica upgrade fails at precheck, replication on
     the failed read replica is broken and the read replica is
     put in the terminated state. Delete the read replica and
     recreate a new read replica based on the upgraded primary DB
     instance.

    Resolve all of the issues identified in the precheck log and
     then retry the major version upgrade. The following is an
     example of a precheck log.

    ```

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Upgrade could not be run on Wed Apr 4 18:30:52 2018
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The instance could not be upgraded from 9.6.11 to 10.6 for the following reasons.
    Please take appropriate action on databases that have usage incompatible with the requested major engine version upgrade and try the upgrade again.

    * There are uncommitted prepared transactions. Please commit or rollback all prepared transactions.* One or more role names start with 'pg_'. Rename all role names that start with 'pg_'.

    * The following issues in the database 'my"million$"db' need to be corrected before upgrading:** The ["line","reg*"] data types are used in user tables. Remove all usage of these data types.
    ** The database name contains characters that are not supported by RDS for PostgreSQL. Rename the database.
    ** The database has extensions installed that are not supported on the target database version. Drop the following extensions from your database: ["tsearch2"].

    * The following issues in the database 'mydb' need to be corrected before upgrading:** The database has views or materialized views that depend on 'pg_stat_activity'. Drop the views.
    ```

15. **If a read replica upgrade fails while**
    **upgrading the database, resolve the issue**
     – A failed read replica is placed in the
     `incompatible-restore` state and
     replication is terminated on the database. Delete the read
     replica and recreate a new read replica based on the
     upgraded primary DB instance.

    ###### Note

    Amazon RDS doesn't upgrade read replicas for Multi-AZ DB clusters. If you
    perform a major version upgrade on a Multi-AZ DB cluster, then the
    replication state of its read replicas changes to
    **terminated**.

    A read replica upgrade might fail for the following
     reasons:

- It was unable to catch up with the primary
DB instance even after a wait time.

- It was in a terminal or incompatible lifecycle
state such as storage-full, incompatible-restore,
and so on.

- When the primary DB instance upgrade started, there
was a separate minor version upgrade running on
the read replica.

- The read replica used incompatible
parameters.

- The read replica was unable to communicate
with the primary DB instance to synchronize the data
folder.

16. **Upgrade your production**
    **database** – When the dry-run major
     version upgrade is successful, you should be able to upgrade
     your production database with confidence. For more
     information, see [Manually upgrading the engine version](user-upgradedbinstance-upgrading.md#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.Manual).

17. Run the `ANALYZE` operation to refresh the
     `pg_statistic` table. You should do this
     for every database on all your PostgreSQL databases.
     Optimizer statistics aren't transferred during a major
     version upgrade, so you need to regenerate all statistics to
     avoid performance issues. Run the command without any
     parameters to generate statistics for all regular tables in
     the current database, as follows:

    ```nohighlight

    ANALYZE VERBOSE;
    ```

    The `VERBOSE` flag is optional, but using it shows
     you the progress. For more information, see [ANALYZE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/sql-analyze.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

    When analyzing specific tables instead of using ANALYZE
     VERBOSE, run the ANALYZE command for each table as
     follows:

    ```nohighlight

    ANALYZE table_name;
    ```

    For partitioned tables, always analyze the parent table. This
     process:

- Automatically samples rows across all
partitions

- Updates statistics for each partition
recursively

- Maintains essential planning statistics at the
parent level

While parent tables store no actual data, analyzing them is
vital for query optimization. Running ANALYZE only on
individual partitions can lead to poor query performance
since the optimizer won't have the comprehensive statistics
needed for efficient cross-partition planning.

###### Note

Run ANALYZE on your system after the upgrade to avoid
performance issues.

After the major version upgrade is complete, we recommend the
following:

- A PostgreSQL upgrade doesn't upgrade any PostgreSQL
extensions. To upgrade extensions, see [Upgrading PostgreSQL extensions in RDS for PostgreSQL databases](user-upgradedbinstance-postgresql-extensionupgrades.md).

- Optionally, use Amazon RDS to view two logs that the
`pg_upgrade` utility produces. These are
`pg_upgrade_internal.log` and
`pg_upgrade_server.log`. Amazon RDS appends a
timestamp to the file name for these logs. You can view
these logs as you can any other log. For more information,
see [Monitoring Amazon RDS log files](user-logaccess.md).

You can also upload the upgrade logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For more
information, see [Publishing PostgreSQL logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](user-logaccess-concepts-postgresql.md#USER_LogAccess.Concepts.PostgreSQL.PublishtoCloudWatchLogs).

- To verify that everything works as expected, test your
application on the upgraded database with a similar
workload. After the upgrade is verified, you can delete this
test instance.
