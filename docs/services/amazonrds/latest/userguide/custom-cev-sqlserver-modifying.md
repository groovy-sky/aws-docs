# Modifying a CEV for RDS Custom for SQL Server

You can modify a CEV using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI. You can modify the CEV description or its availability status. Your CEV
has one of the following status values:

- `available` – You can use this CEV to create a new RDS Custom DB
instance or upgrade a DB instance. This is the default status for a newly created
CEV.

- `inactive` – You can't create or upgrade an RDS Custom DB
instance with this CEV. You can't restore a DB snapshot to create a new RDS Custom DB
instance with this CEV.

You can change the CEV status from `available` to `inactive` or from
`inactive` to `available`. You might change the status to
`INACTIVE` to prevent the accidental use of a CEV or to make a discontinued
CEV eligible for use again.

###### To modify a CEV

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Custom engine versions**.

3. Choose a CEV whose description or status you want to modify.

4. For **Actions**, choose
    **Modify**.

5. Make any of the following changes:

- For **CEV status settings**, choose a new
availability status.

- For **Version description**, enter a new
description.

6. Choose **Modify CEV**.

If the CEV is in use, the console displays **You can't modify**
**the CEV status**. Fix the problems, then try again.

The **Custom engine versions** page appears.

To modify a CEV by using the AWS CLI, run the [modify-custom-db-engine-version](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-custom-db-engine-version.md) command. You can find CEVs to modify by running the [describe-db-engine-versions](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-engine-versions.md) command.

The following options are required:

- `--engine`

- `--engine-version
                              cev`, where
`cev` is the name of the
custom engine version that you want to modify

- `--status` `
                              status`, where
`status` is the
availability status that you want to assign to the CEV

The following example changes a CEV named `15.00.4249.2.my_cevtest` from its current status to
`inactive`.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-custom-db-engine-version \
    --engine custom-sqlserver-ee \
    --engine-version 15.00.4249.2.my_cevtest \
    --status inactive
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-custom-db-engine-version ^
    --engine custom-sqlserver-ee ^
    --engine-version 15.00.4249.2.my_cevtest ^
    --status inactive
```
