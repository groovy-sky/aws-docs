# Removing the NATIVE\_NETWORK\_ENCRYPTION option

You can remove NNE from a DB instance.

To remove the `NATIVE_NETWORK_ENCRYPTION` option from a DB instance, do one of
the following:

- To remove the option from multiple DB instances, remove the
`NATIVE_NETWORK_ENCRYPTION` option from the option group they
belong to. This change affects all DB instances that use the option group. After you
remove the `NATIVE_NETWORK_ENCRYPTION` option, you don't need to
restart your DB instances. For more information, see [Removing an option from an option group](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.RemoveOption).

- To remove the option from a single DB instance, modify the DB instance and specify a
different option group that doesn't include the
`NATIVE_NETWORK_ENCRYPTION` option. You can specify the default
(empty) option group, or a different custom option group. After you remove the
`NATIVE_NETWORK_ENCRYPTION` option, you don't need to restart
your DB instance. For more information, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).
