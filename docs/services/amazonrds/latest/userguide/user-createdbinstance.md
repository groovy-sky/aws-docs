# Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance

The basic building block of Amazon RDS is the DB instance, where you create your databases. You
choose the engine-specific characteristics of the DB instance when you create it. You also choose
the storage capacity, CPU, memory, and so on of the AWS instance on which the database
server runs.

## DB instance prerequisites

###### Important

Before you can create an Amazon RDS DB instance, complete the tasks in [Setting up your Amazon RDS environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SettingUp.html).

The following are prerequisites for creating an RDS DB instance.

###### Topics

- [Configure the network for the DB instance](#USER_CreateDBInstance.Prerequisites.VPC)

- [Additional prerequisites](#USER_CreateDBInstance.Prerequisites.Additional)

### Configure the network for the DB instance

You can create an Amazon RDS DB instance only in a virtual private cloud (VPC) based on the
Amazon VPC service. Also, it must be in an AWS Region that has at least two
Availability Zones. The DB subnet group that you choose for the DB instance must cover at
least two Availability Zones. This configuration ensures that you can configure a
Multi-AZ deployment when you create the DB instance or easily move to one in the
future.

To set up connectivity between your new DB instance and an Amazon EC2 instance in the same
VPC, do so when you create the DB instance. To connect to your DB instance from resources other
than EC2 instances in the same VPC, configure the network connections
manually.

###### Topics

- [Configure automatic network connectivity with an EC2 instance](#USER_CreateDBInstance.Prerequisites.VPC.Automatic)

- [Configure the network manually](#USER_CreateDBInstance.Prerequisites.VPC.Manual)

#### Configure automatic network connectivity with an EC2 instance

When you create an RDS DB instance, you can use the AWS Management Console to set up connectivity
between an EC2 instance and the new DB instance. When you do so, RDS configures your
VPC and network settings automatically. The DB instance is created in the same VPC as
the EC2 instance so that the EC2 instance can access the DB instance.

The following are requirements for connecting an EC2 instance with the
DB instance:

- The EC2 instance must exist in the AWS Region before you create the
DB instance.

If no EC2 instances exist in the AWS Region, the console provides a
link to create one.

- The user who is creating the DB instance must have permissions to perform
the following operations:

- `ec2:AssociateRouteTable`

- `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress`

- `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress`

- `ec2:CreateRouteTable`

- `ec2:CreateSubnet`

- `ec2:CreateSecurityGroup`

- `ec2:DescribeInstances`

- `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces`

- `ec2:DescribeRouteTables`

- `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups`

- `ec2:DescribeSubnets`

- `ec2:ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute`

- `ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupEgress`

Using this option creates a private DB instance. The DB instance uses a DB subnet group
with only private subnets to restrict access to resources within the VPC.

To connect an EC2 instance to the DB instance, choose **Connect to an EC2**
**compute resource** in the **Connectivity** section
on the **Create database** page.

![Connect an EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/ec2-set-up-connection-create.png)

When you choose **Connect to an EC2 compute resource**, RDS
sets the following options automatically. You can't change these settings unless
you choose not to set up connectivity with an EC2 instance by choosing
**Don't connect to an EC2 compute resource**.

Console optionAutomatic setting

**Network type**

RDS sets network type to **IPv4**.
Currently, dual-stack mode isn't supported when you set up a
connection between an EC2 instance and the DB instance.

**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**

RDS sets the VPC to the one associated with the EC2
instance.

**DB subnet group**

RDS requires a DB subnet group with a private subnet in the
same Availability Zone as the EC2 instance. If a DB subnet group
that meets this requirement exists, then RDS uses the existing
DB subnet group. By default, this option is set to
**Automatic setup**.

When you choose
**Automatic setup** and there is no DB
subnet group that meets this requirement, the following
action happens. RDS uses three available private subnets in
three Availability Zones where one of the Availability Zones
is the same as the EC2 instance. If a private subnet isn’t
available in an Availability Zone, RDS creates a private
subnet in the Availability Zone. Then RDS creates the DB
subnet group.

When a private subnet is
available, RDS uses the route table associated with the
subnet and adds any subnets it creates to this route table.
When no private subnet is available, RDS creates a route
table without internet gateway access and adds the subnets
it creates to the route table.

RDS also allows
you to use existing DB subnet groups. Select
**Choose existing** if you want to use
an existing DB subnet group of your choice.

**Public access**

RDS chooses **No** so that the DB instance
isn't publicly accessible.

For security, it is a best practice to keep the database
private and make sure it isn't accessible from the
internet.

**VPC security group (firewall)**

RDS creates a new security group that is associated with
the DB instance. The security group is named
`rds-ec2-n`,
where `n` is a number.
This security group includes an inbound rule with the EC2
VPC security group (firewall) as the source. This security
group that is associated with the DB instance allows the EC2
instance to access the DB instance.

RDS also creates a new security group that is associated
with the EC2 instance. The security group is named
`ec2-rds-n`,
where `n` is a number.
This security group includes an outbound rule with the VPC
security group of the DB instance as the source. This security
group allows the EC2 instance to send traffic to the
DB instance.

You can add another new security group by choosing
**Create new** and typing the name of
the new security group.

You can add existing security groups by choosing
**Choose existing** and selecting
security groups to add.

**Availability Zone**

When you choose **Single DB instance** in
**Availability & durability**
(Single-AZ deployment), RDS chooses the Availability Zone of
the EC2 instance.

When you choose **Multi-AZ DB instance** in
**Availability & durability**
(Multi-AZ DB instance deployment), RDS chooses the Availability
Zone of the EC2 instance for one DB instance in the deployment.
RDS randomly chooses a different Availability Zone for the
other DB instance. Either the primary DB instance or the standby replica
is created in the same Availability Zone as the EC2
instance. When you choose **Multi-AZ**
**DB instance**, there is the possibility of cross
Availability Zone costs if the DB instance and EC2 instance are in
different Availability Zones.

For more information about these settings, see [Settings for DB instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateDBInstance.Settings.html).

If you change these settings after the DB instance is created, the changes might
affect the connection between the EC2 instance and the DB instance.

#### Configure the network manually

To connect to your DB instance from resources other than EC2 instances in the same
VPC, configure the network connections manually. If you use the AWS Management Console to
create your DB instance, you can have Amazon RDS automatically create a VPC for you. Or you
can use an existing VPC or create a new VPC for your DB instance. With any approach,
your VPC requires at least one subnet in each of at least two Availability Zones
for use with an RDS DB instance.

By default, Amazon RDS creates the DB instance an Availability Zone automatically for
you. To choose a specific Availability Zone, you need to change the
**Availability & durability** setting to
**Single DB instance**. Doing so exposes an
**Availability Zone** setting that lets you choose from
among the Availability Zones in your VPC. However, if you choose a Multi-AZ
deployment, RDS chooses the Availability Zone of the primary or writer DB instance
automatically, and the **Availability Zone** setting doesn't
appear.

In some cases, you might not have a default VPC or haven't created a VPC.
In these cases, you can have Amazon RDS automatically create a VPC for you when you
create a DB instance using the console. Otherwise, do the following:

- Create a VPC with at least one subnet in each of at least two of the
Availability Zones in the AWS Region where you want to deploy your DB
instance. For more information, see [Working with a DB instance in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html#Overview.RDSVPC.Create) and [Tutorial: Create a VPC for use with a DB instance (IPv4 only)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateVPC.html).

- Specify a VPC security group that authorizes connections to your DB
instance. For more information, see [Provide access to your DB instance in your VPC by creating a security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SettingUp.html#CHAP_SettingUp.SecurityGroup) and [Controlling access with security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.RDSSecurityGroups.html).

- Specify an RDS DB subnet group that defines at least two subnets in
the VPC that can be used by the DB instance. For more information, see [Working with DB subnet groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html#USER_VPC.Subnets).

If you want to connect to a resource that isn't in the same VPC as the DB instance,
see the appropriate scenarios in [Scenarios for accessing a DB instance in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.Scenarios.html).

### Additional prerequisites

Before you create your DB instance, consider the following additional
prerequisites:

- If you are connecting to AWS using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials, your
AWS account must have certain IAM policies. These grant the permissions
required to perform Amazon RDS operations. For more information, see [Identity and access management for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAM.html).

To use IAM to access the RDS console, sign in to the AWS Management Console with your
IAM user credentials. Then go to the Amazon RDS console at
[https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

- To tailor the configuration parameters for your DB instance, specify a DB
parameter group with the required parameter settings. For information about
creating or modifying a DB parameter group, see [Parameter groups for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.html).

###### Important

If you are using the BYOL model for Amazon RDS for Db2, before creating a DB instance, you
must first create a custom parameter group that contains your IBM Site ID
and IBM Customer ID. For more information, see [Bring your own license (BYOL) for Db2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-licensing.html#db2-licensing-options-byol).

- Determine the TCP/IP port number to specify for your DB instance. The firewalls
at some companies block connections to the default ports for RDS DB instances. If
your company firewall blocks the default port, choose another port for your
DB instance. The default ports for Amazon RDS DB engines are:

RDS for Db2RDS for MariaDBRDS for MySQLRDS for OracleRDS for PostgreSQLRDS for SQL Server5000033063306152154321433

For RDS for SQL Server, the following ports are reserved, and you can't use them when
you create a DB instance: `1234, 1434, 3260, 3343, 3389, 47001,`
and `49152-49156`.

## Creating a DB instance

You can create an Amazon RDS DB instance using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

###### Note

For RDS for Db2, we recommend that you set up items needed for your license model before you
create an RDS for Db2 DB instance. For more information, see [Amazon RDS for Db2 licensing options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-licensing.html).

You can create a DB instance by using the AWS Management Console with **Easy**
**create** enabled or not enabled. With **Easy**
**create** enabled, you specify only the DB engine type, DB instance size,
and DB instance identifier. **Easy create** uses the default setting
for other configuration options. With **Easy create** not
enabled, you specify more configuration options when you create a database,
including ones for availability, security, backups, and maintenance.

###### Note

In the following procedure, **Standard create** is
enabled, and **Easy create** isn't enabled. This
procedure uses Microsoft SQL Server as an example.

For examples that use **Easy create** to walk you through
creating and connecting to sample DB instances for each engine, see [Getting started with Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_GettingStarted.html).

###### To create a DB instance

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

02. In the upper-right corner of the Amazon RDS console, choose the AWS
     Region in which you want to create the DB instance.

03. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

04. Choose **Create database**, then choose
     **Standard create**.

05. For
     **Engine type**, choose IBM Db2, MariaDB, Microsoft
     SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, or PostgreSQL.

    **Microsoft SQL Server** is shown here.

    ![Engine selection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/create-instance-sqlserver.png)

06. For **Database management type**, if you're using
     Oracle or SQL Server choose **Amazon RDS** or
     **Amazon RDS Custom**.

    **Amazon RDS** is shown here. For more information on
     RDS Custom, see [Amazon RDS Custom](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-custom.html).

07. For
     **Edition**, if you're using Db2, Oracle, or SQL
     Server, choose the DB engine edition that you want to use.

    MySQL has only one option for the edition, and MariaDB and PostgreSQL
     have none.

08. For **Version**, choose the engine version.

09. In **Templates**, choose the template that matches
     your use case. If you choose **Production**, the
     following are preselected in a later step:

- **Multi-AZ** failover option

- **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)** storage
option

- **Enable deletion protection** option

We recommend these features for any production environment.

###### Note

Template choices vary by edition.

10. In the **Settings** section, open **Credential**
    **Settings**. Then do the following:
    1. (Optional) Change the **Master username**
        value.

    2. Choose either of the following credentials management
        options:

- **Managed in AWS Secrets Manager**

In **Select the encryption key**,
choose either a KMS key that Secrets Manager creates or a key
that you have created.

###### Note

We recommend AWS Secrets Manager as the most secure
technique for managing credentials. Additional
charges apply. For more information, see [Password management with Amazon RDS and AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html).

- **Self managed**

To specify a password, clear the **Auto**
**generate a password** check box if it is
selected. Enter the same password in **Master**
**password** and **Confirm master**
**password**.
11. (Optional) Set up a connection to a compute resource for this
     DB instance.

    You can configure connectivity between an Amazon EC2 instance and the new
     DB instance during DB instance creation. For more information, see [Configure automatic network connectivity with an EC2 instance](#USER_CreateDBInstance.Prerequisites.VPC.Automatic).

12. In the **Connectivity** section under **VPC**
    **security group (firewall)**, if you select **Create**
    **new**, a VPC security group is created with an inbound rule
     that allows your local computer's IP address to access the database.

13. For the remaining sections, specify your DB instance settings. For
     information about each setting, see [Settings for DB instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateDBInstance.Settings.html).

14. Choose **Create database**.

    If you chose to use an automatically generated password, the
     **View credential details** button appears on the
     **Databases** page.

    To view the master username and password for the DB instance, choose
     **View credential details**.

    To connect to the DB instance as the master user, use the username and
     password that appear.

    ###### Important

    You can't view the master user password again. If you
    don't record it, you might have to change it. If you need to
    change the master user password after the DB instance is available, modify
    the DB instance to do so. For more information about modifying a DB instance,
    see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html).

15. For **Databases**, choose the name of the new
     DB instance.

    On the RDS console, the details for the new DB instance appear. The DB
     instance has a status of **Creating** until the DB instance
     is created and ready for use. When the state changes to
     **Available**, you can connect to the DB instance.
     Depending on the DB instance class and storage allocated, it can take several
     minutes for the new instance to be available.

    ![My DB instances details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/SQLSvr-Launch05.png)

###### Note

If you want to use Db2 license through AWS Marketplace, you must first subscribe to AWS Marketplace and
register with IBM by using the AWS Management Console. For more information, see [Subscribing to Db2 Marketplace listings and registering with IBM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-licensing.html#db2-marketplace-subscribing-registering).

To create a DB instance by using the AWS CLI, call the [create-db-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html)
command with the following parameters:

- `--db-instance-identifier`

- `--db-instance-class`

- `--vpc-security-group-ids`

- `--db-subnet-group`

- `--engine`

- `--master-username`

- `--master-user-password` or `--manage-master-user-password`

- `--allocated-storage`

- `--backup-retention-period`

For information about each setting, see [Settings for DB instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateDBInstance.Settings.html).

This example uses Microsoft SQL Server.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance \
    --engine sqlserver-se \
    --db-instance-identifier mymsftsqlserver \
    --allocated-storage 250 \
    --db-instance-class db.t3.large \
    --vpc-security-group-ids mysecuritygroup \
    --db-subnet-group mydbsubnetgroup \
    --master-username masterawsuser \
    --manage-master-user-password \
    --backup-retention-period 3
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance ^
    --engine sqlserver-se ^
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance ^
    --allocated-storage 250 ^
    --db-instance-class db.t3.large ^
    --vpc-security-group-ids mysecuritygroup ^
    --db-subnet-group mydbsubnetgroup ^
    --master-username masterawsuser ^
    --manage-master-user-password ^
    --backup-retention-period 3
```

This command produces output similar to the following.

```

DBINSTANCE  mydbinstance  db.t3.large  sqlserver-se  250  sa  creating  3  ****  n  10.50.2789
SECGROUP  default  active
PARAMGRP  default.sqlserver-se-14  in-sync
```
