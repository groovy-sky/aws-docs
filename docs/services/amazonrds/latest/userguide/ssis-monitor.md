# Monitoring the status of a deployment task

To track the status of your deployment task, call the `rds_fn_task_status`
function. It takes two parameters. The first parameter should always be
`NULL` because it doesn't apply to SSIS. The second parameter accepts a
task ID.

To see a list of all tasks, set the first parameter to `NULL` and the second
parameter to `0`, as shown in the following example.

```SQL

SELECT * FROM msdb.dbo.rds_fn_task_status(NULL,0);
```

To get a specific task, set the first parameter to `NULL` and the second
parameter to the task ID, as shown in the following example.

```SQL

SELECT * FROM msdb.dbo.rds_fn_task_status(NULL,42);
```

The `rds_fn_task_status` function returns the following information.
