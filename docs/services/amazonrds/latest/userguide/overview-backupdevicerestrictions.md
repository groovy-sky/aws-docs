# Automated backups with unsupported MySQL storage engines

For the MySQL DB engine, automated backups are only supported for the InnoDB storage
engine. Using these features with other MySQL storage engines, including MyISAM, can
lead to unreliable behavior when you're restoring from backups. Specifically, since
storage engines like MyISAM don't support reliable crash recovery, your tables can
be corrupted in the event of a crash. For this reason, we encourage you to use the
InnoDB storage engine.

- To convert existing MyISAM tables to InnoDB tables, you can use the `ALTER TABLE` command, for example: `ALTER TABLE
                      table_name ENGINE=innodb, ALGORITHM=COPY;`

- If you choose to use MyISAM, you can attempt to manually repair tables that become damaged
after a crash by using the `REPAIR` command. For more information,
see [REPAIR\
TABLE statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/repair-table.html) in the MySQL documentation. However, as noted in the
MySQL documentation, there is a good chance that you might not be able to
recover all your data.

- If you want to take a snapshot of your MyISAM tables before restoring, follow these steps:

1. Stop all activity to your MyISAM tables (that is, close all sessions).

You can close all sessions by calling the [mysql.rds\_kill](appendix-mysql-commondbatasks.md) command for each
    process that is returned from the `SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST` command.

2. Lock and flush each of your MyISAM tables. For example, the following commands lock and
    flush two tables named `myisam_table1` and `myisam_table2`:

```sql

mysql> FLUSH TABLES myisam_table, myisam_table2 WITH READ LOCK;
```

3. Create a snapshot of your DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster. When the snapshot has
    completed, release the locks and resume activity on the MyISAM tables.
    You can release the locks on your tables using the following command:

```sql

mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
```

These steps force MyISAM to flush data stored in memory to disk, which ensures a clean
start when you restore from a DB snapshot. For more information on creating a DB
snapshot, see [Creating a DB snapshot for a Single-AZ DB instance for Amazon RDS](user-createsnapshot.md).
