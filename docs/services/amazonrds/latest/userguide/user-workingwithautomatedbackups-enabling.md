# Enabling automated backups

If your DB instance doesn't have automated backups enabled, you can enable them at
any time. You enable automated backups by setting the backup retention period to a
positive nonzero value. When automated backups are turned on, your DB instance is taken offline and a backup is immediately created.

###### Note

If you manage your backups in AWS Backup, you can't enable automated backups. For
more information, see [Using AWS Backup to manage automated backups for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/AutomatedBackups.AWSBackup.html).

###### To enable automated backups immediately

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then choose
    the DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster that you want to modify.

3. Choose **Modify**.

4. For **Backup retention period**, choose a positive nonzero
    value, for example three days.

5. Choose **Continue**.

6. Choose **Apply immediately**.

7. Choose **Modify DB instance** or **Modify**
**cluster** to save your changes and enable automated
    backups.

To enable automated backups, use the AWS CLI [modify-db-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html) or [modify-db-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster.html) command.

Include the following parameters:

- `--db-instance-identifier` (or `--db-cluster-identifier`
for a Multi-AZ DB cluster)

- `--backup-retention-period`

- `--apply-immediately` or `--no-apply-immediately`

In the following example, we enable automated backups by setting the backup retention period to three days. The changes are applied
immediately.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier my_db_instance  \
    --backup-retention-period 3 \
    --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier my_db_instance  ^
    --backup-retention-period 3 ^
    --apply-immediately
```

To enable automated backups, use the RDS API [ModifyDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbinstance.md) or [ModifyDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbcluster.md) operation with the following required
parameters:

- `DBInstanceIdentifier` or `DBClusterIdentifier`

- `BackupRetentionPeriod`

## Viewing automated backups

To view your automated backups, choose **Automated backups** in
the navigation pane. To view individual snapshots associated with an automated
backup, choose **Snapshots** in the navigation pane. Alternatively,
you can describe individual snapshots associated with an automated backup. From
there, you can restore a DB instance directly from one of those snapshots.

Automated snapshot names follow the pattern
`rds:<database-name>-yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm`, with
`yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm` representing the date and time the snapshot was
created.

To describe the automated backups for your existing DB instances using the AWS CLI,
use one of the following commands:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instance-automated-backups --db-instance-identifier DBInstanceIdentifier
```

or

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instance-automated-backups --dbi-resource-id DbiResourceId
```

To describe the retained automated backups for your existing DB instances using
the RDS API, call the [`DescribeDBInstanceAutomatedBackups`](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbinstanceautomatedbackups.md) action with one of
the following parameters:

- `DBInstanceIdentifier`

- `DbiResourceId`
