# Understanding PostgreSQL roles and permissions

When you create an
RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance using the AWS Management Console, an
administrator account is created at the same time. By default, its name is
`postgres`, as shown in the following screenshot:

![The default login identity for Credentials in the Create database page is postgres.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/default-login-identity-apg-rpg.png)

You can choose another name rather than accept the default ( `postgres`). If you
do, the name you choose must start with a letter and be between 1 and 16 alphanumeric
characters. For simplicity's sake, we refer to this main user account by its default value
( `postgres`) throughout this guide.

If you use the `create-db-instance` AWS CLI rather
than the AWS Management Console, you create the name by passing it with the `master-username`
parameter in the command. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md).

Whether you use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the Amazon RDS API, and whether you use the default
`postgres` name or choose a different name, this first database user account is a
member of the `rds_superuser` group and has `rds_superuser`
privileges.
