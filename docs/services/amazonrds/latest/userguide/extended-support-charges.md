# Amazon RDS Extended Support charges

You will incur charges for all engines enrolled in RDS Extended Support
beginning the day after the RDS end of standard support date. For the RDS end of
standard support date, see [Major versions](mysql-concepts-versionmgmt.md#MySQL.Concepts.VersionMgmt.ReleaseCalendar) and [Release calendar for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](../postgresqlreleasenotes/postgresql-release-calendar.md). RDS Extended Support charges apply to standby
instances in Multi-AZ deployments.

The additional charge for RDS Extended Support automatically stops when you take one of the
following actions:

- Upgrade to an engine version that's covered under standard support.

- Delete the database that's running a major version past the RDS
end of standard support date.

The charges will restart if your target engine version enters RDS Extended Support in the
future.

For example, RDS for PostgreSQL 11 enters Extended Support on March 1, 2024, but
charges don't start until April 1, 2024. You upgrade your RDS for PostgreSQL 11 database
to RDS for PostgreSQL 12 on April 30, 2024. You will only be charged for 30 days
of Extended Support on RDS for PostgreSQL 11\. You continue running RDS for PostgreSQL 12 on this DB instance past the RDS end of standard support
date of February 28, 2025. Your database will again incur RDS Extended Support charges starting on
March 1, 2025.

pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/pricing).

## Avoiding charges for Amazon RDS Extended Support

You can avoid being charged for RDS Extended Support by preventing RDS from
creating or restoring a DB instance or a
Multi-AZ DB cluster
past the RDS end of standard support date. To do this, use the AWS CLI or the
RDS API.

In the AWS CLI, specify `open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled` for
the `--engine-lifecycle-support` option. In the RDS API, specify
`open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled` for the
`LifeCycleSupport` parameter. For more information, see [Creating a DB instance or a Multi-AZ DB cluster](extended-support-creating-db-instance.md) or [Restoring a DB instance or a Multi-AZ DB cluster](extended-support-restoring-db-instance.md).
