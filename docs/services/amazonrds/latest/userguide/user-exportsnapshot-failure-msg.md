# Failure messages for Amazon S3 export tasks for Amazon RDS

The following table describes the messages that are returned when Amazon S3 export tasks fail.

Failure messageDescription**`An unknown internal error occurred.`**

The task has failed because of an unknown error, exception, or failure.

**`An unknown internal error occurred writing the export task's metadata to the S3 bucket**
**[bucket name].`**

The task has failed because of an unknown error, exception, or failure.

**`The RDS export failed to write the export task's metadata because it can't assume the**
**IAM role [role ARN].`**

The export task assumes your IAM role to validate whether it is allowed to write metadata to your S3
bucket. If the task can't assume your IAM role, it fails.

**`The RDS export failed to write the export task's metadata to the S3 bucket [bucket name]**
**using the IAM role [role ARN] with the KMS key [key ID]. Error code: [error code]`**

One or more permissions are missing, so the export task can't access the S3 bucket. This failure
message is raised when receiving one of the following error codes:

- `AWSSecurityTokenServiceException` with the error code `AccessDenied`

- `AmazonS3Exception` with the error code `NoSuchBucket`,
`AccessDenied`, `KMS.KMSInvalidStateException`, `403
                                          Forbidden`, or `KMS.DisabledException`

These error codes indicate settings are misconfigured for the IAM role, S3 bucket, or KMS key.

**`The IAM role [role ARN] isn't authorized to call [S3 action] on the S3 bucket [bucket name].**
**Review your permissions and retry the export.`**

The IAM policy is misconfigured. Permission for the specific S3 action on the S3 bucket is missing,
which causes the export task to fail.

**`KMS key check failed. Check the credentials on your KMS key and try again.`**The KMS key credential check failed.**`S3 credential check failed. Check the permissions on your S3 bucket and IAM**
**policy.`**The S3 credential check failed.**`The S3 bucket [bucket name] isn't valid. Either it isn't located in the current AWS**
**Region or it doesn't exist. Review your S3 bucket name and retry the export.`**The S3 bucket is invalid.**`The S3 bucket [bucket name] isn't located in the current AWS Region. Review your S3 bucket**
**name and retry the export.`**The S3 bucket is in the wrong AWS Region.
