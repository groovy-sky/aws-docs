and VPC security groups, skip ahead to [Getting started with Amazon RDS](chap-gettingstarted.md).

## Sign up for an AWS account

If you do not have an AWS account, complete the following steps to create one.

###### To sign up for an AWS account

1. Open [https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

2. Follow the online instructions.

Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call or text message and entering
    a verification code on the phone keypad.

When you sign up for an AWS account, an _AWS account root user_ is created. The root user has access to all AWS services
    and resources in the account. As a security best practice, assign administrative access to a user, and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-root-user.md#root-user-tasks).

AWS sends you a confirmation email after the sign-up process is
complete. At any time, you can view your current account activity and manage your account by
going to [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/) and choosing **My**
**Account**.

## Create a user with administrative access

After you sign up for an AWS account, secure your AWS account root user, enable AWS IAM Identity Center, and create an administrative user so that you
don't use the root user for everyday tasks.

###### Secure your AWS account root user

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) as the account owner by choosing **Root user** and entering your AWS account email address. On the next page, enter your password.

For help signing in by using root user, see [Signing in as the root user](../../../signin/latest/userguide/console-sign-in-tutorials.md#introduction-to-root-user-sign-in-tutorial) in the _AWS Sign-In User Guide_.

2. Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your root user.

For instructions, see [Enable a virtual MFA device for your AWS account root user (console)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/enable-virt-mfa-for-root.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

###### Create a user with administrative access

1. Enable IAM Identity Center.

For instructions, see [Enabling\
    AWS IAM Identity Center](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-set-up-for-idc.md) in the
    _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

2. In IAM Identity Center, grant administrative access to a user.

For a tutorial about using the IAM Identity Center directory as your identity source, see [Configure user access with the default IAM Identity Center directory](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/quick-start-default-idc.md) in the
    _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

###### Sign in as the user with administrative access

- To sign in with your IAM Identity Center user, use the sign-in URL that was sent to your email address when you created the IAM Identity Center user.

For help signing in using an IAM Identity Center user, see [Signing in to the AWS access portal](../../../signin/latest/userguide/iam-id-center-sign-in-tutorial.md) in the _AWS Sign-In User Guide_.

###### Assign access to additional users

1. In IAM Identity Center, create a permission set that follows the best practice of applying least-privilege permissions.

For instructions, see [Create a permission set](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-started-create-a-permission-set.md) in the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

2. Assign users to a group, and then assign single sign-on access to the group.

For instructions, see [Add groups](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/addgroups.md) in the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

## Grant programmatic access

Users need programmatic access if they want to interact with AWS outside of the AWS Management Console. The way to grant programmatic access depends on the type of user that's accessing AWS.

To grant users programmatic access, choose one of the following options.

## Determine requirements

The basic building block of Amazon RDS is the DB instance. In a DB instance, you create your
databases. A DB instance provides a network address called an _endpoint_. Your applications use this endpoint to connect to your DB
instance. When you create a DB instance, you specify details like storage, memory,
database engine and version, network configuration, security, and maintenance periods.
You control network access to a DB instance through a security group.

Before you create a DB instance and a security group, you must know your DB instance and
network needs. Here are some important things to consider:

- **Resource requirements**– What are the memory and
processor requirements for your application or service? You use these settings
to help you determine what DB instance class to use. For specifications about DB
instance classes, see [DB instance classes](concepts-dbinstanceclass.md).

- **VPC, subnet, and security group –** Your DB instance
will most likely be in a virtual private cloud (VPC). To connect to your DB
instance, you need to set up security group rules. These rules are set up
differently depending on what kind of VPC you use and how you use it. For
example, you can use: a default VPC or a user-defined VPC.

The following list describes the rules for each VPC option:

- **Default VPC** – If your AWS account has a
default VPC in the current AWS Region, that VPC is configured to support
DB instances. If you specify the default VPC when you create the DB
instance, do the following:

- Make sure to create a _VPC security group_ that authorizes
connections from the application or service to the Amazon RDS DB
instance. Use the **Security Group** option on the VPC
console or the AWS CLI to create VPC security groups. For
information, see [Step 3: Create a VPC security group](user-vpc-workingwithrdsinstanceinavpc.md#USER_VPC.CreateVPCSecurityGroup).

- Specify the default DB subnet group. If this is the first DB instance you have created
in this AWS Region, Amazon RDS creates the default DB subnet group
when it creates the DB instance.

- **User-defined VPC –** If you want to specify a
user-defined VPC when you create a DB instance, be aware of the
following:

- Make sure to create a _VPC security group_ that authorizes
connections from the application or service to the Amazon RDS DB
instance. Use the **Security Group** option on the VPC
console or the AWS CLI to create VPC security groups. For information, see
[Step 3: Create a VPC security group](user-vpc-workingwithrdsinstanceinavpc.md#USER_VPC.CreateVPCSecurityGroup).

- The VPC must meet certain requirements in order to host DB instances, such
as having at least two subnets, each in a separate Availability
Zone. For information, see [Amazon VPC and Amazon RDS](user-vpc.md).

- Make sure to specify a DB subnet group that defines which subnets in that VPC can be
used by the DB instance. For information, see the DB subnet
group section in [Working with a DB instance in a VPC](user-vpc-workingwithrdsinstanceinavpc.md#Overview.RDSVPC.Create).

- **High availability –** Do you need failover
support? On Amazon RDS, a Multi-AZ deployment creates a primary DB instance and a
secondary standby DB instance in another Availability Zone for failover support.
We recommend Multi-AZ deployments for production workloads to maintain high
availability. For development and test purposes, you can use a deployment that
isn't Multi-AZ. For more information, see [Configuring and managing a Multi-AZ deployment for Amazon RDS](concepts-multiaz.md).

- **IAM policies**– Does your AWS account have
policies that grant the permissions needed to perform Amazon RDS operations? If you
are connecting to AWS using IAM credentials, your IAM account must have
IAM policies that grant the permissions required to perform Amazon RDS operations.
For more information, see [Identity and access management for Amazon RDS](usingwithrds-iam.md).

- **Open ports**– What TCP/IP port does your database
listen on? The firewalls at some companies might block connections to the
default port for your database engine. If your company firewall blocks the
default port, choose another port for the new DB instance. When you create a DB
instance that listens on a port you specify, you can change the port by
modifying the DB instance.

- **AWS Region**– What AWS Region do you want your
database in? Having your database in close proximity to your application or web
service can reduce network latency. For more information, see [Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones](concepts-regionsandavailabilityzones.md).

- **DB disk subsystem**– What are your storage
requirements? Amazon RDS provides three storage types:

- General Purpose (SSD)

- Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS)

- Magnetic (also known as standard storage)

For more information on Amazon RDS storage, see [Amazon RDS DB instance storage](chap-storage.md).

When you have the information you need to create the security group and the DB instance,
continue to the next step.

## Provide access to your DB instance in your VPC by creating a security group

VPC security groups provide access to DB instances in a VPC.
They act as a firewall for the associated DB instance,
controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at the DB instance level. DB instances are
created by default with a firewall and a default security group that protect
the DB instance.

Before you can connect to your DB instance, you must add rules to a security group that enable you to
connect. Use your network and configuration information to create rules to allow access to your DB
instance.

For example, suppose that you have an application that accesses a database on your DB
instance in a VPC. In this case, you must add a custom TCP rule that specifies the port
range and IP addresses that your application uses to access the database. If you have an
application on an Amazon EC2 instance, you can use the security group that you set
up for the Amazon EC2 instance.

You can configure connectivity between an Amazon EC2 instance a DB instance when you create the
DB instance. For more information, see [Configure automatic network connectivity with an EC2 instance](user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.Prerequisites.VPC.Automatic).

###### Tip

You can set up network connectivity between an Amazon EC2 instance and a DB
instance automatically when you create the DB instance. For more information, see
[Configure automatic network connectivity with an EC2 instance](user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.Prerequisites.VPC.Automatic).

For information about how to connect resources in Amazon Lightsail to your DB instances, see [Connect Lightsail resources to AWS services using VPC peering](../../../lightsail/latest/userguide/using-lightsail-with-other-aws-services.md).

For information about common scenarios for accessing a DB instance, see
[Scenarios for accessing a DB instance in a VPC](user-vpc-scenarios.md).

###### To create a VPC security group

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

###### Note

Make sure you are in the VPC console, not the RDS console.

2. In the upper-right corner of the AWS Management Console, choose the AWS Region where you want to create
    your VPC security group and DB instance. In the list of Amazon VPC resources for that
    AWS Region, you should see at least one VPC and several subnets. If you
    don't, you don't have a default VPC in that AWS Region.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Security Groups**.

4. Choose **Create security group**.

The **Create security group** page appears.

5. In **Basic details**, enter the
    **Security group name** and **Description**.
    For **VPC**, choose the VPC that you
    want to create your DB instance in.

6. In **Inbound rules**, choose **Add rule**.

1. For **Type**, choose **Custom TCP**.

2. For **Port range**, enter the port value to use for your DB
       instance.

3. For **Source**, choose a security group name or type the IP address
       range (CIDR value) from where you access the DB instance. If you choose
       **My IP**, this allows access to the DB instance
       from the IP address detected in your browser.
7. If you need to add more IP addresses or different port ranges, choose **Add rule**
    and enter the information for the rule.

8. (Optional) In **Outbound rules**, add rules for outbound traffic.
    By default, all outbound traffic is allowed.

9. Choose **Create security group**.

You can use the VPC security group that you just created as the security group for your DB
instance when you create it.

###### Note

If you use a default VPC, a default subnet group spanning all of the VPC's subnets is created
for you. When you create a DB instance, you can select the default VPC and use **default**
for **DB Subnet Group**.

After you have completed the setup requirements, you can create a DB instance using your
requirements and security group. To do so, follow the instructions in [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md). For
information about getting started by creating a DB instance that uses a specific DB
engine, see the relevant documentation in the following table.
