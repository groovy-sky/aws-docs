# RDS version numbers in RDS for PostgreSQL

RDS version numbers use the
`major.minor.patch`
naming scheme. An RDS patch version includes important bug fixes added to a
minor version after its release. For information about RDS Extended Support version
numbering, see [Amazon RDS Extended Support version naming](extended-support-versions.md#extended-support-naming).

To identify the Amazon RDS version number of your database, you must first create
the `rds_tools` extension by using the following command:

```

CREATE EXTENSION rds_tools;
```

Starting with the release of PostgreSQL version 15.2-R2, you can find out the
RDS version number of your RDS for PostgreSQL database with the following SQL
query:

```sql

postgres=> SELECT rds_tools.rds_version();
```

For example, querying an RDS for PostgreSQL 15.2 database returns the
following:

```nohighlight

rds_version
----------------
 15.2.R2
(1 row)

```
