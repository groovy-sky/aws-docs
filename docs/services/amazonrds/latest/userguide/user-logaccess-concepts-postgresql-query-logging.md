# Turning on query logging for your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance

You can collect more detailed information about your database activities, including
queries, queries waiting for locks, checkpoints, and many other details by setting some
of the parameters listed in the following table. This topic focuses on logging
queries.

ParameterDefaultDescription

log\_connections

–

Logs each successful connection.

log\_disconnections

–

Logs the end of each session and its duration.

log\_checkpoints

1

Logs each checkpoint.

log\_lock\_waits

–

Logs long lock waits. By default, this parameter isn't
set.

log\_min\_duration\_sample

–

(ms) Sets the minimum execution time above which a sample of
statements is logged. Sample size is set using the
`log_statement_sample_rate` parameter.

log\_min\_duration\_statement

–

Any SQL statement that runs atleast for the specified amount of
time or longer gets logged. By default, this parameter isn't
set. Turning on this parameter can help you find unoptimized
queries.

log\_statement

–

Sets the type of statements logged. By default, this parameter
isn't set, but you can change it to `all`,
`ddl`, or `mod` to specify the types of
SQL statements that you want logged. If you specify anything other
than `none` for this parameter, you should also take
additional steps to prevent the exposure of passwords in the log
files. For more information, see [Mitigating risk of password exposure when using query logging](#USER_LogAccess.Concepts.PostgreSQL.Query_Logging.mitigate-risk).

log\_statement\_sample\_rate

–

The percentage of statements exceeding the time specified in
`log_min_duration_sample` to be logged, expressed as
a floating point value between 0.0 and 1.0.

log\_statement\_stats

–

Writes cumulative performance statistics to the server
log.

## Using logging to find slow performing queries

You can log SQL statements and queries to help find slow performing queries. You
turn on this capability by modifying the settings in the `log_statement`
and `log_min_duration` parameters as outlined in this section. Before
turning on query logging for your
RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance, you should be
aware of possible password exposure in the logs and how to mitigate the risks. For
more information, see [Mitigating risk of password exposure when using query logging](#USER_LogAccess.Concepts.PostgreSQL.Query_Logging.mitigate-risk).

Following, you can find reference information about the `log_statement`
and `log_min_duration` parameters.

###### log\_statement

This parameter specifies the type of SQL statements that should get sent to
the log. The default value is `none`. If you change this parameter to
`all`, `ddl`, or `mod`, be sure to apply
recommended actions to mitigate the risk of exposing passwords in the logs. For
more information, see [Mitigating risk of password exposure when using query logging](#USER_LogAccess.Concepts.PostgreSQL.Query_Logging.mitigate-risk).

**all**

Logs all statements. This setting is recommended for debugging
purposes.

**ddl**

Logs all data definition language (DDL) statements, such as CREATE,
ALTER, DROP, and so on.

**mod**

Logs all DDL statements and data manipulation language (DML)
statements, such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, which modify the
data.

**none**

No SQL statements get logged. We recommend this setting to avoid the
risk of exposing passwords in the logs.

###### log\_min\_duration\_statement

Any SQL statement that runs atleast for the specified amount of time or longer
gets logged. By default, this parameter isn't set. Turning on this parameter can
help you find unoptimized queries.

**–1–2147483647**

The number of milliseconds (ms) of runtime over which a statement gets
logged.

###### To set up query logging

These steps assume that your
RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance uses a custom DB
parameter group.

1. Set the `log_statement` parameter to `all`. The
    following example shows the information that is written to the
    `postgresql.log` file with this parameter
    setting.

FROM support,aws_comprehend.detect_sentiment(feedback, 'en') s
ORDER BY s.confidence DESC;

   ----------------------- END OF LOG ----------------------
```

2. Set the `log_min_duration_statement` parameter. The following
    example shows the information that is written to the
    `postgresql.log` file when the parameter is set to
    `1`.

Queries that exceed the duration specified in the
    `log_min_duration_statement` parameter are logged. The
    following shows an example. You can view the log file for your
    RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance in the
    Amazon RDS Console.

```nohighlight

2022-10-05 19:05:19 UTC:52.95.4.1(6461):postgres@labdb:[6144]:LOG: statement: DROP table comments;

   ----------------------- END OF LOG ----------------------
```

### Mitigating risk of password exposure when using query logging

We recommend that you keep `log_statement` set to `none`
to avoid exposing passwords. If you set `log_statement` to
`all`, `ddl`, or `mod`, we recommend that
you take one or more of the following steps.

- For the client, encrypt sensitive information. For more information,
see [Encryption Options](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/encryption-options.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation. Use the
`ENCRYPTED` (and `UNENCRYPTED`) options of the
`CREATE` and `ALTER` statements. For more
information, see [CREATE USER](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createuser.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

- For your RDS for PostgreSQL DB
instance, set up and use the PostgreSQL Auditing (pgAudit)
extension. This extension redacts sensitive information in CREATE and
ALTER statements sent to the log. For more information, see [Using pgAudit to log database activity](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-pgaudit.md).

- Restrict access to the CloudWatch logs.

- Use stronger authentication mechanisms such as IAM.
