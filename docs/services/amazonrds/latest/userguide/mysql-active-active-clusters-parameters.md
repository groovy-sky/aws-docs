# Required parameter settings for active-active clusters

Configuring parameters for active-active clusters in Amazon RDS for MySQL is essential for
maintaining consistent performance and operational stability. This table details the key
parameters that control replication, conflict resolution, and workload distribution.
Correct configuration ensures efficient synchronization between nodes, minimizes
replication lag, and optimizes resource utilization in distributed or high-traffic
environments.

ParameterDescriptionRequired setting

`binlog_format`

Sets the binary logging format. The default value for RDS for MySQL
8.0 versions and lower is `MIXED`. The default value for
RDS for MySQL 8.4 versions is `ROW`. For more information,
see [the MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html).

`ROW`

`enforce_gtid_consistency`

Enforces GTID consistency for statement execution. The default value for RDS for MySQL is `OFF`. For more information, see
[the MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-gtids.html).

`ON`

`group_replication_group_name`

Sets the Group Replication name to a UUID. The UUID format is
`11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555`. You can
generate a MySQL UUID by connecting to a MySQL DB instance and
running `SELECT UUID()`. The value must be the same for
all of the DB instances in the active-active cluster. For more
information, see [the MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/miscellaneous-functions.html).

A MySQL UUID

`gtid-mode`

Controls GTID-based logging. The default value for RDS for MySQL is `OFF_PERMISSIVE`. For more information, see
[the MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-gtids.html).

`ON`

`rds.custom_dns_resolution`

Specifies whether to allow DNS resolution from the Amazon DNS
server in your VPC. DNS resolution must be enabled when Group
Replication is enabled with the
`rds.group_replication_enabled` parameter. DNS
resolution can't be enabled when Group Replication is disabled with
the `rds.group_replication_enabled` parameter. For more
information, see [Amazon DNS\
server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#AmazonDNS) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.

`1`

`rds.group_replication_enabled`

Specifies whether Group Replication is enabled for a DB instance.
Group Replication must be enabled on a DB instance in an
active-active cluster.

`1`

`replica_preserve_commit_order` (RDS for MySQL 8.4 and
higher versions) or `slave_preserve_commit_order`
(RDS for MySQL 8.0 versions)

Controls the order that transactions are committed on a replica.
The default value for RDS for MySQL is `ON`. For more
information, see [the MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-replica.html).

`ON`
