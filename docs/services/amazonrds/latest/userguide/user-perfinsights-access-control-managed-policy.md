# Attaching the AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsReadOnly policy to an IAM principal

`AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsReadOnly` is an AWS managed
policy that grants access to all read-only operations of the Amazon RDS Performance Insights API.

If you attach `AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsReadOnly` to a permission set or role,
you must also attach the following CloudWatch
permissions:

- `GetMetricStatistics`

- `ListMetrics`

- `GetMetricData`

With these permissions, the recipient can use
Performance Insights with other console features.

For more information about CloudWatch permissions, see
[Amazon CloudWatch \
permissions reference](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/permissions-reference-cw.md).
