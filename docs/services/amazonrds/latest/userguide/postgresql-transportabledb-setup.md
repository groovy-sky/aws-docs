# Setting up to transport a PostgreSQL database

Before you begin, make sure that your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instances meet the following requirements:

- The RDS for PostgreSQL DB instances for source and destination must run the same version of PostgreSQL.

- The destination DB can't have a database of the same name as the source DB that you want to transport.

- The account you use to run the transport needs `rds_superuser` privileges on both the source DB and the destination DB.

- The security group for the source DB instance must allow inbound access from the
destination DB instance. This might already be the case if your source and destination
DB instances are located in the VPC. For more information about security groups, see [Controlling access with security groups](overview-rdssecuritygroups.md).

Transporting databases from a source DB instance to a destination DB instance requires several changes to the DB parameter group associated with
each instance. That means that you must create a custom DB parameter group for the
source DB instance and create a custom DB parameter group for the destination DB instance.

###### Note

If your DB instances are already configured using custom
DB parameter groups, you can start with step 2 in the following procedure.

###### To configure the custom DB group parameters for transporting databases

For the following steps, use an account that has `rds_superuser` privileges.

1. If the source and destination DB instances use a default DB parameter group, you need to create
    a custom DB parameter group using the appropriate version for your instances. You do this so
    you can change values for several parameters.
    For more information, see [Parameter groups for Amazon RDS](user-workingwithparamgroups.md).

2. In the custom DB parameter group, change values for the following parameters:

- `shared_preload_libraries` – Add `pg_transport` to the list of
libraries.

- `pg_transport.num_workers` – The default value is 3. Increase or reduce this
value as needed for your database. For a 200 GB database, we recommend no larger than 8. Keep in mind that
if you increase the default value for this parameter, you should also increase the value of `max_worker_processes`.

- `pg_transport.work_mem` – The default value is either 128 MB or 256 MB, depending
on the PostgreSQL version. The default setting can typically be left unchanged.

- `max_worker_processes` – The value of this parameter needs to be set using the
following calculation:

```nohighlight

(3 * pg_transport.num_workers) + 9
```

This value is required on the destination to handle various background worker
processes involved in the transport. To learn more about
`max_worker_processes,` see [Resource Consumption](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

For more information about `pg_transport` parameters, see [Transportable databases parameter reference](postgresql-transportabledb-parameters.md).

3. Reboot the source RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance and the destination instance so that
    the settings for the parameters take effect.

4. Connect to your RDS for PostgreSQL source DB instance.

```nohighlight

psql --host=source-instance.111122223333.aws-region.rds.amazonaws.com --port=5432 --username=postgres --password
```

5. Remove extraneous extensions from the public schema of the DB instance. Only the `pg_transport`
    extension is allowed during the actual transport operation.

6. Install the `pg_transport` extension as follows:

```sql

postgres=> CREATE EXTENSION pg_transport;
CREATE EXTENSION
```

7. Connect to your RDS for PostgreSQL destination DB instance. Remove any extraneous extensions, and then install
    the `pg_transport` extension.

```sql

postgres=> CREATE EXTENSION pg_transport;
CREATE EXTENSION
```
