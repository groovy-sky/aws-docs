# Importing data from Db2 to Amazon RDS for Db2 with the INSERT command

You can use the `INSERT` command from a self-managed Db2 server to insert your
data into an Amazon RDS for Db2 database. With this migration approach, you use a nickname for the
remote RDS for Db2 DB instance. Your self-managed Db2 database (source) must be able to connect
to the RDS for Db2 database (target).

###### Important

The `INSERT` command method is useful for migrating small tables. If your
network bandwidth between your self-managed Db2 database and RDS for Db2 database is
limited, we recommend that you use a different migration approach. For more information,
see [Using native Db2 tools to migrate data from Db2 to Amazon RDS for Db2](db2-native-db2-tools.md).

###### To copy data from a self-managed Db2 database to an RDS for Db2 database

1. Catalog the RDS for Db2 DB instance on the self-managed Db2 instance.
1. Catalog the node. In the following example, replace
       `dns_ip_address` and
       `port` with the DNS name or the IP address and
       the port number of the self-managed Db2 database.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 catalog tcpip node remnode REMOTE dns_ip_address SERVER port
      ```

2. Catalog the database. In the following example, replace
       `rds_database_name` with the name of the
       database on your RDS for Db2 DB instance.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 catalog database rds_database_name as remdb at node remnode \
          authentication server_encrypt
      ```
2. Enable federation on the self-managed Db2 instance. In the following example,
    replace `source_database_name` with the name of your
    database on the self-managed Db2 instance.

```nohighlight

db2 update dbm cfg using FEDERATED YES source_database_name
```

3. Create tables on the RDS for Db2 DB instance.
1. Catalog the node. In the following example, replace
       `dns_ip_address` and
       `port` with the DNS name or the IP address and
       the port number of the self-managed Db2 database.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 catalog tcpip node srcnode REMOTE dns_ip_address server port
      ```

2. Catalog the database. In the following example, replace
       `source_database_name` and
       `source_database_alias` with the name of the
       self-managed Db2 database and the alias that you want to use for this
       database.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 catalog database source_database_name as source_database_alias at node srcnode \
          authentication server_encrypt
      ```
4. Attach to the source database. In the following example, replace
    `source_database_alias`,
    `user_id`, and `user_password`
    with the alias that you created in the previous step and the user ID and password
    for the self-managed Db2 database.

```nohighlight

db2look -d source_database_alias -i user_id -w user_password -e -l -a -f -wlm \
       -cor -createdb -printdbcfg -o db2look.sql
```

5. Set up federation, and create a nickname for the RDS for Db2 database table on the
    self-managed Db2 instance.
1. Connect to your local database. In the following example, replace
       `source_database_name` with the name of the
       database on your self-managed Db2 instance.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 connect to source_database_name
      ```

2. Create a wrapper to access Db2 data sources.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 create wrapper drda
      ```

3. Define a data source on a federated database. In the following example,
       replace `admin` and
       `admin_password` with your credentials for your
       self-managed Db2 instance. Replace
       `rds_database_name` with the name of the
       database on your RDS for Db2 DB instance.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 "create server rdsdb2 type DB2/LUW version '11.5.9.0' \
          wrapper drda authorization "admin" password "admin_password" \
          options( dbname 'rds_database_name', node 'remnode')"
      ```

4. Map the users on the two databases. In the following example, replace
       `master_username` and
       `master_password` with your credentials for
       your RDS for Db2 DB instance.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 "create user mapping for user server rdsdb2 \
          options (REMOTE_AUTHID 'master_username', REMOTE_PASSWORD 'master_password')"
      ```

5. Verify the connection to the RDS for Db2 server.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 set passthru rdsdb2
      ```

6. Create a nickname for the table in the remote RDS for Db2 database. In the
       following example, replace `NICKNAME` and
       `TABLE_NAME` with a nickname for the table and
       the name of the table.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 create nickname REMOTE.NICKNAME for RDSDB2.TABLE_NAME.NICKNAME
      ```
6. Insert data into the table in the remote RDS for Db2 database. Use the nickname in a
    `select` statement on the local table in the self-managed Db2
    instance. In the following example, replace `NICKNAME` and
    `TABLE_NAME` with a nickname for the table and the name
    of the table.

```nohighlight

db2 "INSERT into REMOTE.NICKNAME select * from RDS2DB2.TABLE_NAME.NICKNAME"
```
