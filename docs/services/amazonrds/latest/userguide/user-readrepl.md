# Working with DB instance read replicas

A _read replica_ is a read-only copy of a DB instance. You can reduce the
load on your primary DB instance by routing queries from your applications to the read replica. In
this way, you can elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance
for read-heavy database workloads.

To create a read replica from a source DB instance, Amazon RDS uses the built-in replication features
of the DB engine. For information about using read replicas with a specific engine, see the
following sections:

After you create a read replica from a source DB instance, the source becomes the primary DB instance.
When you make updates to the primary DB instance, Amazon RDS copies them asynchronously to the read
replica. The following diagram shows a source DB instance replicating to a read replica in a
different Availability Zone (AZ). Clients have read/write access to the primary DB instance and
read-only access to the replica.

Read replicas are billed as standard DB instances at the same rates as the DB instance class used for
the replica. You aren't charged for the data transfer incurred in replicating data between
the source DB instance and a read replica within the same AWS Region. For more information, see
[Cross-Region replication costs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.XRgn.html#USER_ReadRepl.XRgn.Costs) and

### Use cases for read replicas

Deploying one or more read replicas for a given source DB instance might make sense in a
variety of scenarios, including the following:

- Scaling beyond the compute or I/O capacity of a single DB instance for read-heavy
database workloads. You can direct this excess read traffic to one or more read
replicas.

- Serving read traffic while the source DB instance is unavailable. In some cases,
your source DB instance might not be able to take I/O requests, for example due to I/O
suspension for backups or scheduled maintenance. In these cases, you can direct
read traffic to your read replicas. For this use case, keep in mind that the
data on the read replica might be "stale" because the source DB instance is
unavailable.

- Business reporting or data warehousing scenarios where you might want business
reporting queries to run against a read replica, rather than your production
DB instance.

- Implementing disaster recovery. You can promote a read replica to a standalone
instance as a disaster recovery solution if the primary DB instance fails.

### How read replicas work

When you create a read replica, you specify an existing DB instance as the source. Then
Amazon RDS takes a snapshot of the source instance and creates a read-only instance from the
snapshot. Amazon RDS then uses the asynchronous replication method for the DB engine to
update the read replica whenever there is a change to the primary DB instance.

The read replica operates as a DB instance that allows only read-only
connections. Exceptions are the RDS for Db2 and the RDS for Oracle DB engines, which support replica
databases in standby mode and mounted mode, respectively. A standby replica and mounted
replica don't accept user connections and so can't serve read-only workloads. The
primary use for standby replicas and mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery.
For more information, see [Working with replicas for Amazon RDS for Db2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-replication.html) and [Working with read replicas for Amazon RDS for Oracle](oracle-read-replicas.md).

Applications connect to a read replica just as they do to any DB instance. Amazon RDS replicates
all databases from the source DB instance.

You must manually create read replicas. RDS doesn't support autoscaling of read
replicas, which is the automatic add or removing of read replicas as read demand
changes.

### Read replicas in a Multi-AZ deployment

You can configure a read replica for a DB instance that also has a standby replica
configured for high availability in a Multi-AZ deployment. Replication with the standby replica is
synchronous. Unlike a read replica, a standby replica can't serve read traffic.

In the following scenario, clients have read/write access to a primary DB instance in one
AZ. The primary instance copies updates asynchronously to a read replica in a second AZ
and also copies them synchronously to a standby replica in a third AZ. Clients have read
access only to the read replica.

![Read replica and standby replica configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/read-and-standby-replica.png)

For more information about high availability and standby replicas, see [Configuring and managing a Multi-AZ deployment for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html).

### Cross-Region read replicas

In some cases, a read replica resides in a different AWS Region from its primary
DB instance. In these cases, Amazon RDS sets up a secure communications channel between the primary
DB instance and the read replica. Amazon RDS establishes any AWS security configurations needed
to enable the secure channel, such as adding security group entries. For more
information about cross-Region read replicas, see [Creating a read replica in a different AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.XRgn.html).

The information in this chapter applies to creating Amazon RDS read replicas either in the
same AWS Region as the source DB instance, or in a separate AWS Region. The following
information doesn't apply to setting up replication with an instance that is running on
an Amazon EC2 instance or that is on-premises.

### Read replica storage types

By default, a read replica is created with the same storage type as the source DB
instance. However, you can create a read replica that has a different storage type from
the source DB instance based on the options listed in the following table.

Source DB instance storage typeSource DB instance storage allocationRead replica storage type optionsProvisioned IOPS100 GiB–64 TiBProvisioned IOPS, General Purpose, MagneticGeneral Purpose100 GiB–64 TiBProvisioned IOPS, General Purpose, MagneticGeneral Purpose<100 GiBGeneral Purpose, MagneticMagnetic100 GiB–6 TiBProvisioned IOPS, General Purpose, MagneticMagnetic<100 GiBGeneral Purpose, Magnetic

###### Note

When you increase the allocated storage of a read replica, it must be by at least
10 percent. If you try to increase the value by less than 10 percent, you get an
error.

### Restrictions for creating a replica from a replica

Amazon RDS doesn't support circular replication. You can't configure a DB instance to serve as a
replication source for an existing DB instance. You can only create a new read replica from an
existing DB instance. For example, if `MySourceDBInstance` replicates to
`ReadReplica1`, you can't configure
`ReadReplica1` to replicate back to
`MySourceDBInstance`.

For RDS for MariaDB and RDS for MySQL, and for certain versions of RDS for PostgreSQL, you can
create a read replica from an existing read replica. For example, you can create new
read replica `ReadReplica2` from existing replica
`ReadReplica1`. For RDS for Db2, RDS for Oracle, and RDS for SQL Server, you
can't create a read replica from an existing read replica.

### Considerations when deleting replicas

RDS doesn't support autoscaling of read replicas. Thus, RDS won't increase the number
of replicas when demand increases or decrease the number of replicas when demand
decreases. If you no longer need read replicas, manually delete them using the same
mechanisms for deleting a DB instance. If you delete a source DB instance without deleting its read
replicas in the same AWS Region, each replica is promoted to a standalone DB instance.

For information about deleting a DB instance, see [Deleting a DB instance](user-deleteinstance.md). For information about read replica promotion,
see [Promoting a read replica to be a standalone DB instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.Promote.html). For
information related to deleting the source DB instance for a cross-Region read replica, see
[Cross-Region replication considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.XRgn.html#USER_ReadRepl.XRgn.Cnsdr).
