# Analyzing your database workload on an Amazon RDS for SQL Server DB instance with Database Engine Tuning Advisor

Database Engine Tuning Advisor is a client application provided by Microsoft that analyzes database workload and recommends an
optimal set of indexes for your Microsoft SQL Server databases based on the kinds of queries you run. Like SQL Server Management
Studio, you run Tuning Advisor from a client computer that connects to your Amazon RDS DB instance that is running SQL Server. The
client computer can be a local computer that you run on premises within your own network or it can be an Amazon EC2 Windows instance
that is running in the same region as your Amazon RDS DB instance.

This section shows how to capture a workload for Tuning Advisor to analyze. This is the preferred process for capturing a workload
because Amazon RDS restricts host access to the SQL Server instance. For more information, see [Database Engine\
Tuning Advisor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/database-engine-tuning-advisor) in the Microsoft documentation.

To use Tuning Advisor, you must provide what is called a workload to the advisor. A workload is a set of Transact-SQL statements
that run against a database or databases that you want to tune. Database Engine Tuning Advisor uses trace files, trace tables,
Transact-SQL scripts, or XML files as workload input when tuning databases. When working with Amazon RDS, a workload can be a file on
a client computer or a database table on an Amazon RDS for SQL Server DB accessible to your client computer. The file or the table
must contain queries against the databases you want to tune in a format suitable for replay.

For Tuning Advisor to be most effective, a workload should be as realistic as
possible. You can generate a workload file or table by performing a trace against your
DB instance. While a trace is running, you can either simulate a load on your DB
instance or run your applications with a normal load.

There are two types of traces: client-side and server-side. A client-side trace is
easier to set up and you can watch trace events being captured in real-time in SQL
Server Profiler. A server-side trace is more complex to set up and requires some
Transact-SQL scripting. In addition, because the trace is written to a file on the Amazon RDS
DB instance, storage space is consumed by the trace. It is important to track of how
much storage space a running server-side trace uses because the DB instance could enter
a storage-full state and would no longer be available if it runs out of storage
space.

For a client-side trace, when a sufficient amount of trace data has been captured in
the SQL Server Profiler, you can then generate the workload file by saving the trace to
either a file on your local computer or in a database table on a DB instance that is
available to your client computer. The main disadvantage of using a client-side trace is
that the trace may not capture all queries when under heavy loads. This could weaken the
effectiveness of the analysis performed by the Database Engine Tuning Advisor. If you
need to run a trace under heavy loads and you want to ensure that it captures every
query during a trace session, you should use a server-side trace.

For a server-side trace, you must get the trace files on the DB instance into a
suitable workload file or you can save the trace to a table on the DB instance after the
trace completes. You can use the SQL Server Profiler to save the trace to a file on your
local computer or have the Tuning Advisor read from the trace table on the DB
instance.
