# Backing up and restoring a CDB

You can back up and restore your CDB using either RDS DB snapshots or Recovery Manager
(RMAN).

## Backing up and restoring a CDB using DB snapshots

DB snapshots work similarly in the CDB and non-CDB architectures. The principal differences
are as follows:

- When you restore a DB snapshot of a CDB, you can't rename the CDB. The CDB is named
`RDSCDB` and can't be changed.

- When you restore a DB snapshot of a CDB, you can't rename PDBs. You can modify the
PDB name by using the [modify-tenant-database](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifytenantdatabase.md) command.

- To find tenant databases in a snapshot, use the CLI command [describe-db-snapshot-tenant-databases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBSnapshotTenantDatabases.html).

- You can't directly interact with the tenant databases in a CDB snapshot that
uses the multi-tenant architecture configuration. If you restore the DB snapshot, you
restore all its tenant databases.

- RDS for Oracle implicitly copies tags on a tenant database to the tenant database in
a DB snapshot. When you restore a tenant database, the tags appear in the restored
database.

- If you restore a DB snapshot and specify new tags using the `--tags`
parameter, the new tags overwrite all existing tags.

- If you take a DB snapshot of a CDB instance that has tags, and you specify
`--copy-tags-to-snapshot`, RDS for Oracle copies tags from the tenant
databases to the tenant databases in the snapshot.

## Backing up and restoring a CDB using RMAN

To learn how to back up and restore a CDB or individual tenant database using RMAN,
see [Performing common RMAN tasks for Oracle DB instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.Oracle.CommonDBATasks.RMAN.html).
