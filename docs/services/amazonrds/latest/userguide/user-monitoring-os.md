# Monitoring OS metrics with Enhanced Monitoring

With Enhanced Monitoring, you can monitor the operating system of your DB instance in real time. When you want to
see how different processes or threads use the CPU, Enhanced Monitoring metrics are useful.

## Overview of Enhanced Monitoring

Amazon RDS provides metrics in real time for the operating system (OS) that your DB instance runs on. You can view all the system metrics and
process information for your RDS DB instances on the console. You can manage which metrics you want to monitor for each instance and customize the
dashboard according to your requirements. For descriptions of the Enhanced Monitoring metrics, see [OS metrics in Enhanced Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring-Available-OS-Metrics.html).

RDS delivers the metrics from Enhanced Monitoring into your Amazon CloudWatch Logs account. You can create metrics filters in
CloudWatch from CloudWatch Logs and display the graphs on the CloudWatch dashboard. You can consume the Enhanced Monitoring JSON output
from CloudWatch Logs in a monitoring system of your choice. For more information, see [Enhanced Monitoring](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/faqs) in the Amazon RDS FAQs.

### Enhanced Monitoring availability

Enhanced Monitoring is available for the following database engines:

- Db2

- MariaDB

- Microsoft SQL Server

- MySQL

- Oracle

- PostgreSQL

### Differences between CloudWatch and Enhanced Monitoring metrics

A _hypervisor_ creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). Using a hypervisor, an instance can
support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing memory and CPU. CloudWatch gathers metrics about CPU utilization from the
hypervisor for a DB instance. In contrast, Enhanced Monitoring gathers its metrics from an agent on the DB
instance.

You might find differences between the CloudWatch and Enhanced Monitoring measurements, because the hypervisor layer
performs a small amount of work. The differences can be greater if your DB instances use smaller instance classes. In
this scenario, more virtual machines (VMs) are probably managed by the hypervisor layer on a single physical
instance.

For descriptions of the Enhanced Monitoring metrics, see [OS metrics in Enhanced Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring-Available-OS-Metrics.html). For more information about CloudWatch metrics, see the _[Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/working-with-metrics.md)_.

### Retention of Enhanced Monitoring metrics

By default, Enhanced Monitoring metrics are stored for 30 days in the CloudWatch Logs. This retention period is different
from typical CloudWatch metrics.

To modify the amount of time the metrics are stored in the CloudWatch Logs, change the retention for the
`RDSOSMetrics` log group in the CloudWatch console. For more information, see [Change log data retention in CloudWatch\
logs](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/working-with-log-groups-and-streams.md#SettingLogRetention) in the _Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide_.

### Cost of Enhanced Monitoring

Enhanced Monitoring metrics are stored in the CloudWatch Logs instead of in CloudWatch metrics. The cost of Enhanced Monitoring
depends on the following factors:

- You are charged for Enhanced Monitoring only if you exceed the amount of data transfer and storage provided by Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Charges are
based on CloudWatch Logs data transfer and storage rates.

- The amount of information transferred for an RDS instance is directly proportional to the defined granularity
for the Enhanced Monitoring feature. A smaller monitoring interval results in more frequent reporting of OS
metrics and increases your monitoring cost. To manage costs, set different granularities for different instances
in your accounts.

- Usage costs for Enhanced Monitoring are applied for each DB instance that Enhanced Monitoring is enabled for.
Monitoring a large number of DB instances is more expensive than monitoring only a few.

- DB instances that support a more compute-intensive workload have more OS process activity to report and
higher costs for Enhanced Monitoring.
