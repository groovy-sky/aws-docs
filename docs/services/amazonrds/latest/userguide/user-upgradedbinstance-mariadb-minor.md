# Automatic minor version upgrades for RDS for MariaDB

If you specify the following settings when creating or modifying a DB instance, you can have your
DB instance automatically upgraded.

- The **Auto minor version upgrade** setting is enabled.

- The **Backup retention period** setting is greater than 0.

In the AWS Management Console, these settings are under **Additional configuration**. The
following image shows the **Auto minor version upgrade** setting.

For more information about these settings, see [Settings for DB instances](user-modifyinstance-settings.md).

For some RDS for MariaDB major versions in some AWS Regions, one minor version is designated by RDS as
the automatic upgrade version. After a minor version has been tested and approved by
Amazon RDS, the minor version upgrade occurs automatically during your maintenance window.
RDS doesn't automatically set newer released minor versions as the automatic
upgrade version. Before RDS designates a newer automatic upgrade version, several
criteria are considered, such as the following:

- Known security issues

- Bugs in the MariaDB community version

- Overall fleet stability since the minor version was released

###### Note

Support for using TLS version 1.0 and 1.1 was removed starting with specific minor versions of MariaDB. For information about
supported MariaDB minor versions, see [SSL/TLS support for MariaDB DB instances on Amazon RDS](mariadb-concepts-sslsupport.md).

You can run the following AWS CLI command to determine the current automatic minor
upgrade target version for a specified MariaDB minor version in a specific AWS Region.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-engine-versions \
--engine mariadb \
--engine-version minor_version \
--region region \
--query "DBEngineVersions[*].ValidUpgradeTarget[*].{AutoUpgrade:AutoUpgrade,EngineVersion:EngineVersion}" \
--output text
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-engine-versions ^
--engine mariadb ^
--engine-version minor_version ^
--region region ^
--query "DBEngineVersions[*].ValidUpgradeTarget[*].{AutoUpgrade:AutoUpgrade,EngineVersion:EngineVersion}" ^
--output text
```

For example, the following AWS CLI command determines the automatic minor upgrade target
for MariaDB minor version 10.5.16 in the US East (Ohio) AWS Region
(us-east-2).

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-engine-versions \
--engine mariadb \
--engine-version 10.5.16 \
--region us-east-2 \
--query "DBEngineVersions[*].ValidUpgradeTarget[*].{AutoUpgrade:AutoUpgrade,EngineVersion:EngineVersion}" \
--output table
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-engine-versions ^
--engine mariadb ^
--engine-version 10.5.16 ^
--region us-east-2 ^
--query "DBEngineVersions[*].ValidUpgradeTarget[*].{AutoUpgrade:AutoUpgrade,EngineVersion:EngineVersion}" ^
--output table
```

Your output is similar to the following.

```nohighlight

----------------------------------
|    DescribeDBEngineVersions    |
+--------------+-----------------+
|  AutoUpgrade |  EngineVersion  |
+--------------+-----------------+
|  True        |  10.5.17        |
|  False       |  10.5.18        |
|  False       |  10.5.19        |
|  False       |  10.6.5         |
|  False       |  10.6.7         |
|  False       |  10.6.8         |
|  False       |  10.6.10        |
|  False       |  10.6.11        |
|  False       |  10.6.12        |
+--------------+-----------------+
```

In this example, the `AutoUpgrade` value is `True` for MariaDB
version 10.5.17. So, the automatic minor upgrade target is MariaDB version 10.5.17,
which is highlighted in the output.

A MariaDB DB instance is automatically upgraded during your maintenance window if
the following criteria are met:

- The **Auto minor version upgrade** setting is enabled.

- The **Backup retention period** setting is greater than 0.

- The DB instance is running a minor DB engine version that is less than the
current automatic upgrade minor version.
