# Terminology

To help you better understand Trusted Language Extensions, view the following glossary for terms used
in this topic.

**Trusted Language Extensions for PostgreSQL**

_Trusted Language Extensions for PostgreSQL_ is the official name of the open source
development kit that's packaged as the `pg_tle` extension.
It's available for use on any PostgreSQL system. For more information,
see [aws/pg\_tle](https://github.com/aws/pg_tle) on
GitHub.

**Trusted Language Extensions**

_Trusted Language Extensions_ is the short name for Trusted Language Extensions for PostgreSQL. This
shortened name and its abbreviation (TLE) are also used in this
documentation.

**trusted language**

A _trusted language_ is a programming or scripting
language that has specific security attributes. For example, trusted
languages typically restrict access to the file system, and they limit use
of specified networking properties. The TLE development kit is designed to
support trusted languages. PostgreSQL supports several different languages
that are used to create trusted or untrusted extensions. For an example, see
[Trusted and Untrusted PL/Perl](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plperl-trusted.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.
When you create an extension using Trusted Language Extensions, the extension inherently
uses trusted language mechanisms.

**TLE extension**

A _TLE extension_ is a PostgreSQL extension that's been
created by using the Trusted Language Extensions (TLE) development kit.
