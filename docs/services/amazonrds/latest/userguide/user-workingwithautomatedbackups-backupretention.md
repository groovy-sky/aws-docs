# Backup retention period

You can set the backup retention period when you create or restore a DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster.
If you create a DB instance using the Amazon RDS API or the AWS CLI and if you don't set
the backup retention period, the default backup retention period is one day.
If you create a DB instance using the console, the default backup retention period is
seven days.

After you create a DB instance or cluster, you can modify the backup retention period.
You can set the backup retention period of a DB instance to between 0 and 35 days. Setting the backup
retention period to 0 disables automated backups. For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, you can set the backup retention period
to between 1 and 35 days. Manual snapshot limits (100 per
Region) don't apply to automated backups.

During restore operations, you have the option to specify a backup retention
period for your DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster. When you don't explicitly set this value, the
restored database inherits the backup retention period from the source snapshot or
instance. Note that this inheritance behavior is unique to restore operations—when
creating a new database, the system applies default retention periods instead.

###### Important

An outage occurs if you change the backup retention period of a DB instance from 0 to a nonzero value or
from a nonzero value to 0.

RDS doesn't include time spent in the `stopped` state when the
backup retention period is calculated. Automated backups aren't created while a DB instance or cluster is stopped.
Backups can be retained longer than the backup retention period if a DB instance has been
stopped.
