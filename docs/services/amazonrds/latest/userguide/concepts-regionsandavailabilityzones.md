# Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones

Amazon cloud computing resources are hosted in multiple locations world-wide. These
locations are composed of AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones. Each _AWS Region_ is a separate geographic area. Each AWS Region
has multiple, isolated locations known as _Availability_
_Zones_.

###### Note

For information about finding the Availability Zones for an AWS Region, see [Describe \
your Availability Zones](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-regions-availability-zones.md#availability-zones-describe) in the Amazon EC2 documentation.

By using Local Zones, you can place resources, such as compute and
storage, in multiple locations closer to your users. Amazon RDS enables you to place resources,
such as DB instances, and data in multiple locations. Resources aren't replicated
across AWS Regions unless you do so specifically.

Amazon operates state-of-the-art, highly-available data centers. Although rare, failures can
occur that affect the availability of DB instances that are in the same location. If you
host all your DB instances in one location that is affected by such a failure, none of your
DB instances will be available.

![AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/Con-AZ-Local.png)

It is important to remember that each AWS Region is completely independent. Any Amazon RDS
activity you initiate (for example, creating database instances or listing available
database instances) runs only in your current default AWS Region. The default AWS Region
can be changed in the console, or by setting the [`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-region) environment variable. Or it can be
overridden by using the `--region` parameter with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For more
information, see [Configuring the\
AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html), specifically the sections about environment variables and command
line options.

Amazon RDS supports special AWS Regions called AWS GovCloud (US). These are designed to allow US
government agencies and customers to move more sensitive workloads into the cloud. The
AWS GovCloud (US) Regions address the US government's specific regulatory and compliance
requirements. For more information, see [What\
is AWS GovCloud (US)?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/whatis.html)

To create or work with an Amazon RDS DB instance in a specific AWS Region, use the corresponding regional service endpoint.

## AWS Regions

Each AWS Region is designed to be isolated from the other AWS Regions. This design
achieves the greatest possible fault tolerance and stability.

When you view your resources, you see only the resources that are tied to the AWS Region that
you specified. This is because AWS Regions are isolated from each other, and we don't
automatically replicate resources across AWS Regions.

If you do not explicitly specify an endpoint, the US West (Oregon) endpoint is the default.

When you work with a DB instance using the AWS CLI or API operations, make sure that you specify its regional
endpoint.

## Availability Zones

When you create a DB instance, you can choose an Availability Zone or have Amazon RDS choose one for you randomly. An Availability
Zone is represented by an AWS Region code followed by a letter identifier (for example,
`us-east-1a`).

Use the [describe-availability-zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-availability-zones.html)
Amazon EC2 command as follows to describe the Availability Zones within the specified Region that are enabled for your account.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region region-name
```

For example, to describe the Availability Zones within the US East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1) that are enabled for
your account, run the following command:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region us-east-1
```

You can't choose the Availability Zones for the primary and secondary DB instances in a Multi-AZ DB
deployment. Amazon RDS chooses them for you randomly. For more information about Multi-AZ deployments, see [Configuring and managing a Multi-AZ deployment for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html).

###### Note

Random selection of Availability Zones by RDS doesn't guarantee an even distribution of DB instances among
Availability Zones within a single account or DB subnet group. You can request a specific AZ when you create or modify a
Single-AZ instance, and you can use more-specific DB subnet groups for Multi-AZ instances. For more information, see
[Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md) and
[Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

## Local Zones

A _Local Zone_ is an extension of an AWS Region
that is geographically close to your users. You can extend any VPC from the parent AWS
Region into Local Zones. To do so, create a new subnet and assign it to the AWS
Local Zone. When you create a subnet in a Local Zone, your VPC is extended to that Local
Zone. The subnet in the Local Zone operates the same as other subnets in your
VPC.

When you create a DB instance, you can choose a subnet in a Local Zone. Local Zones
have their own connections to the internet and support Direct Connect. Thus, resources created
in a Local Zone can serve local users with very low-latency communications. For more
information, see [AWS Local Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones).

A Local Zone is represented by an AWS Region code followed by an identifier that
indicates the location, for example `us-west-2-lax-1a`.

###### Note

A Local Zone can't be included in a Multi-AZ deployment.

###### To use a Local Zone

1. Enable the Local Zone in the Amazon EC2 console.

For more information, see
    [Enabling Local Zones](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-regions-availability-zones.md#enable-zone-group) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide._

2. Create a subnet in the Local Zone.

For more information, see
    [Creating a subnet in your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/working-with-vpcs.html#AddaSubnet) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide._

3. Create a DB subnet group in the Local Zone.

When you create a DB subnet group, choose the Availability Zone group for the Local Zone.

For more information, see [Creating a DB instance in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html#USER_VPC.InstanceInVPC).

4. Create a DB instance that uses the DB subnet group in the Local Zone.

For more information, see [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md).

###### Important

Currently, the only AWS Local Zone where Amazon RDS is available is Los Angeles in the US West (Oregon) Region.
