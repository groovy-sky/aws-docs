# Configuring an S3 bucket

The audit log files are automatically uploaded from the DB instance to your S3 bucket. The
following restrictions apply to the S3 bucket that you use as a target for audit files:

- It must be in the same AWS Region and AWS account as the DB instance.

- It must not be open to the public.

- The bucket owner must also be the IAM role owner.

- Your IAM role must have permissions for the customer-managed KMS key associated with the S3 bucket server-side encryption.

The target key that is used to store the data follows this naming schema:
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket/key-prefix/instance-name/audit-name/node_file-name.ext`

###### Note

You set both the bucket name and the key prefix values with the ( `S3_BUCKET_ARN`) option setting.

The schema is composed of the following elements:

- `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` – The name of your S3
bucket.

- `key-prefix` – The custom key prefix you
want to use for audit logs.

- `instance-name` – The name of your Amazon RDS
instance.

- `audit-name` – The name of the
audit.

- `node` – The identifier of the node that
is the source of the audit logs ( `node1` or `node2`). There
is one node for a Single-AZ instance and two replication nodes for a Multi-AZ
instance. These are not primary and secondary nodes, because the roles of primary
and secondary change over time. Instead, the node identifier is a simple label.

- `node1` – The first replication node
(Single-AZ has one node only).

- `node2` – The second replication node
(Multi-AZ has two nodes).

- `file-name` – The target file name. The
file name is taken as-is from SQL Server.

- `ext` – The extension of the file
( `zip` or `sqlaudit`):

- `zip` – If compression is enabled
(default).

- `sqlaudit` – If compression is
disabled.
