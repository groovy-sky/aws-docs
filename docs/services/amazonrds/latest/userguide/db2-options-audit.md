# Db2 audit logging

With Db2 audit logging, Amazon RDS records database activity, including users logging on to the
database and queries run against the database. RDS uploads the completed audit logs to your
Amazon S3 bucket, using the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you provide.

## Setting up Db2 audit logging

To enable audit logging for an Amazon RDS for Db2 database, you enable the
`DB2_AUDIT` option on the RDS for Db2 DB instance. Then, configure an audit
policy to enable the feature for the specific database. To enable the option on the
RDS for Db2 DB instance, you configure the option settings for the `DB2_AUDIT`
option. You do so by providing the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for your Amazon S3 bucket and
the IAM role with permissions to access your bucket.

To set up Db2 audit logging for an RDS for Db2 database, complete the following
steps.

###### Topics

- [Step 1: Create an Amazon S3 bucket](#db2-audit-create-s3-bucket)

- [Step 2: Create an IAM policy](#db2-audit-create-iam-policy)

- [Step 3: Create an IAM role and attach your IAM policy](#db2-audit-create-iam-role)

- [Step 4: Configure an option group for Db2 audit logging](#db2-audit-configure-options-group)

- [Step 5: Configure the audit policy](#db2-audit-configure-audit-policy)

- [Step 6: Check the audit configuration](#db2-audit-check-config-status)

### Step 1: Create an Amazon S3 bucket

If you haven't already done so, create an Amazon S3 bucket where Amazon RDS can upload your
RDS for Db2 database's audit log files. The following restrictions apply to the S3
bucket that you use as a target for audit files:

- It must be in the same AWS Region as your RDS for Db2 DB instance.

- It must not be open to the public.

- The bucket owner must also be the IAM role owner.

To learn how to create an Amazon S3 bucket, see [Creating a\
bucket](../../../s3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

After you enable audit logging, Amazon RDS automatically sends the logs from your DB
instance to the following locations:

- DB instance level logs –
`bucket_name/db2-audit-logs/dbi_resource_id/date_time_utc/`

- Database level logs –
`bucket_name/db2-audit-logs/dbi_resource_id/date_time_utc/db_name/`

Take note of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your bucket. This information is
needed to complete subsequent steps.

### Step 2: Create an IAM policy

Create an IAM policy with the permissions required to transfer audit log files
from your DB instance to your Amazon S3 bucket. This step assumes that you have an S3
bucket.

Before you create the policy, gather the following information:

- The ARN for your bucket.

- The ARN for your AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key, if your bucket uses
SSE-KMS encryption.

Create an IAM policy that includes the following permissions:

```nohighlight

"s3:ListBucket",
 "s3:GetBucketAcl",
 "s3:GetBucketLocation",
 "s3:PutObject",
 "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
 "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
 "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
```

###### Note

Amazon RDS needs the `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` action internally to verify
that the same AWS account owns both the S3 bucket and the RDS for Db2 DB
instance.

If your bucket uses SSE-KMS encryption, also include the following
permissions for your IAM role and AWS KMS key.

Include the following permissions to the policy for your IAM role.

```nohighlight

"kms:GenerateDataKey",
 "kms:Decrypt"
```

Include the following permissions to the key policy for your AWS KMS key. Replace `111122223333` with your account number and `AROA123456789EXAMPLE` with your IAM role name.

```nohighlight

{
  "Sid": "Allow RDS role to use the key",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": [
      "arn:aws:sts::111122223333:assumed-role/AROA123456789EXAMPLE/RDS-Db2Audit",
      "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/AROA123456789EXAMPLE"
    ]
  },
  "Action": [
    "kms:GenerateDataKey",
    "kms:Decrypt"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

You can create an IAM policy by using the AWS Management Console or the AWS Command Line Interface
(AWS CLI).

                   ]
               }
           ]
     }'
```

2. After the policy is created, note the ARN of the policy. You need
    the ARN for [Step 3: Create an IAM role and attach your IAM policy](#db2-audit-create-iam-role).

For information about creating an IAM policy, see [Creating IAM\
policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) in the IAM User Guide.

### Step 3: Create an IAM role and attach your IAM policy

This step assumes that you created the IAM policy in [Step 2: Create an IAM policy](#db2-audit-create-iam-policy). In this step, you create an IAM
role for your RDS for Db2 DB instance and then attach your IAM policy to the
role.

You can create an IAM role for your DB instance by using the console or the
AWS CLI.

###### To create an IAM role and attach your IAM policy to it

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**.

03. Choose **Create role**.

04. For **Trusted entity type**, select
     **AWS service**.

05. For **Service or use case**, select
     **RDS**, and then select **RDS –**
    **Add Role to Database**.

06. Choose **Next**.

07. For **Permissions policies**, search for and
     select the name of the IAM policy that you created.

08. Choose **Next**.

09. For **Role name**, enter a role name.

10. (Optional) For **Description**, enter a
     description for the new role.

11. Choose **Create role**.

###### To create an IAM role and attach your IAM policy to it

1. Run the [create-role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-role.html) command. In the
    following example, replace `iam_role_name`
    with a name for your IAM role.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws iam create-role \
       --role-name iam_role_name \
       --assume-role-policy-document '{
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
           {
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Principal": {
               "Service": "rds.amazonaws.com"
             },
             "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
           }
         ]
       }'
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws iam create-role ^
       --role-name iam_role_name ^
       --assume-role-policy-document '{
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
           {
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Principal": {
               "Service": "rds.amazonaws.com"
             },
             "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
           }
         ]
       }'
```

2. After the role is created, note the ARN of this role. You need
    this ARN for the next step, [Step 4: Configure an option group for Db2 audit logging](#db2-audit-configure-options-group).

3. Run the [attach-role-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/attach-role-policy.html) command. In the
    following example, replace `iam_policy_arn`
    with the ARN of the IAM policy that you created in [Step 2: Create an IAM policy](#db2-audit-create-iam-policy). Replace
    `iam_role_name` with the name of the
    IAM role that you just created.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws iam attach-role-policy \
      --policy-arn iam_policy_arn \
      --role-name iam_role_name
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws iam attach-role-policy ^
      --policy-arn iam_policy_arn ^
      --role-name iam_role_name
```

For more information, see [Creating a role to\
delegate permissions to an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

### Step 4: Configure an option group for Db2 audit logging

The process for adding the Db2 audit logging option to an RDS for Db2 DB instance is
as follows:

1. Create a new option group, or copy or modify an existing option
    group.

2. Add and configure all required options.

3. Associate the option group with the DB instance.

After you add the Db2 audit logging option, you don't need to restart your DB
instance. As soon as the option group is active, you can create audits and store
audit logs in your S3 bucket.

###### To add and configure Db2 audit logging on a DB instance's option group

1. Choose one of the following:

- Use an existing option group.

- Create a custom DB option group, and use that option group. For
more information, see [Creating an option group](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Create).

2. Add the **DB2\_AUDIT** option to the option group, and
    configure the option settings. For more information about adding options,
    see [Adding an option to an option group](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.AddOption).

- For **IAM\_ROLE\_ARN**, enter the ARN of the IAM
role that you created in [Step 3: Create an IAM role and attach your IAM policy](#db2-audit-create-iam-role).

- For **S3\_BUCKET\_ARN**, enter the ARN of the S3
bucket to use for your Db2 audit logs. The bucket must be in the
same Region as your RDS for Db2 DB instance. The policy
associated with the IAM role you entered must allow the required
operations on this resource.

3. Apply the option group to a new or existing DB instance. Choose one of the
    following:

- If you are creating a new DB instance, apply the option group when
you launch the instance.

- On an existing DB instance, apply the option group by modifying
the instance and then attaching the new option group. For more
information, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

### Step 5: Configure the audit policy

To configure the audit policy for your RDS for Db2 database, connect to the
`rdsadmin` database using the master username and master password for
your RDS for Db2 DB instance. Then, call the `rdsadmin.configure_db_audit`
stored procedure with the DB name of your database and the applicable parameter
values.

The following example connects to the database and configures an audit policy for
`testdb` with the categories AUDIT, CHECKING, OBJMAINT, SECMAINT,
SYSADMIN, and VALIDATE. The status value `BOTH` logs success and
failures, and the `ERROR TYPE` is `NORMAL` by default. For
more information about how to use this stored procedure, see [rdsadmin.configure\_db\_audit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-sp-managing-audit-policies.html#db2-sp-configure-db-audit).

```nohighlight

db2 "connect to rdsadmin user master_user using master_password"
db2 "call rdsadmin.configure_db_audit('testdb', 'ALL', 'BOTH', ?)"
```

### Step 6: Check the audit configuration

To make sure that your audit policy is set up correctly, check the status of your
audit configuration.

To check the configuration, connect to the `rdsadmin` database using
the master username and master password for your RDS for Db2 DB instance. Then, run the
following SQL statement with the DB name of your database. In the following example,
the DB name is `testdb`.

```nohighlight

db2 "select task_id, task_type, database_name, lifecycle,
    varchar(bson_to_json(task_input_params), 500) as task_params,
    cast(task_output as varchar(500)) as task_output
    from table(rdsadmin.get_task_status(null,'testdb','CONFIGURE_DB_AUDIT'))"

Sample Output

TASK_ID              TASK_TYPE            DATABASE_NAME       LIFECYCLE
-------------------- -------------------- --------------- -------------
                   2  CONFIGURE_DB_AUDIT            DB2DB       SUCCESS

... continued ...
TASK_PARAMS
--------------------------------------------------------
{ "AUDIT_CATEGORY" : "ALL", "CATEGORY_SETTING" : "BOTH" }

... continued ...
                                        TASK_OUTPUT
---------------------------------------------------
2023-12-22T20:27:03.029Z Task execution has started.

2023-12-22T20:27:04.285Z Task execution has completed successfully.

```

## Managing Db2 audit logging

After you set up Db2 audit logging, you can modify the audit policy for a specific
database, or disable audit logging at the database level or for the entire DB instance.
You can also change the Amazon S3 bucket where your log files are uploaded to.

###### Topics

- [Modifying a Db2 audit policy](#db2-audit-modifying-policy)

- [Modifying the location of your log files](#db2-audit-modifying-location)

- [Disabling Db2 audit logging](#db2-audit-disabling)

### Modifying a Db2 audit policy

To modify the audit policy for a specific RDS for Db2 database, run the
`rdsadmin.configure_db_audit` stored procedure. With this stored
procedure, you can change the categories, category settings, and error type
configuration of the audit policy. For more information, see [rdsadmin.configure\_db\_audit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-sp-managing-audit-policies.html#db2-sp-configure-db-audit).

### Modifying the location of your log files

To change the Amazon S3 bucket where your log files are uploaded to, do one of the
following:

- Modify the current option group attached to your RDS for Db2 DB instance
– Update the `S3_BUCKET_ARN` setting for the
`DB2_AUDIT` option to point to the new bucket. Also, make
sure to update the IAM policy attached to the IAM role specified by the
`IAM_ROLE_ARN` setting in the attached option group. This
IAM policy must provide your new bucket with the required access
permissions. For information about the permissions required in the IAM
policy, see [Create an IAM\
policy](#db2-audit-create-iam-policy).

- Attach your RDS for Db2 DB instance to a different option group –
Modify your DB instance to change the option group that's attached to it.
Make sure that the new option group is configured with the correct
`S3_BUCKET_ARN` and `IAM_ROLE_ARN` settings. For
information about how to configure these settings for the
`DB2_AUDIT` option, see [Configure an option\
group](#db2-audit-configure-options-group).

When you modify the option group, make sure that you apply the changes
immediately. For more information, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

### Disabling Db2 audit logging

To disable Db2 audit logging, do one of the following:

- Disable audit logging for the RDS for Db2 DB instance – Modify your DB
instance and remove the option group with the `DB2_AUDIT` option
from it. For more information, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

- Disable audit logging for a specific database – Stop audit logging
and remove the audit policy by calling
`rdsadmin.disable_db_audit` with the DB name of your
database. For more information, see [rdsadmin.disable\_db\_audit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-sp-managing-audit-policies.html#db2-sp-disable-db-audit).

```nohighlight

db2 "call rdsadmin.disable_db_audit(
      'db_name',
      ?)"

```

## Viewing audit logs

After you enable Db2 audit logging, wait for at least one hour before viewing the
audit data in your Amazon S3 bucket. Amazon RDS automatically sends the logs from your RDS for Db2 DB
instance to the following locations:

- DB instance level logs –
`bucket_name/db2-audit-logs/dbi_resource_id/date_time_utc/`

- Database level logs –
`bucket_name/db2-audit-logs/dbi_resource_id/date_time_utc/db_name/`

## Troubleshooting Db2 audit logging

Use the following information to troubleshoot common issues with Db2 audit
logging.

### Can't configure the audit policy

If calling the stored procedure `rdsadmin.configure_db_audit` returns
an error, it could be that the option group with the `DB2_AUDIT` option
isn't associated with the RDS for Db2 DB instance. Modify the DB instance to add the
option group, and then try calling the stored procedure again. For more information,
see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

### No data in the Amazon S3 bucket

If logging data is missing from the Amazon S3 bucket, check the following:

- The Amazon S3 bucket is in the same Region as your RDS for Db2 DB
instance.

- The role you specified in the `IAM_ROLE_ARN` option setting is
configured with the required permissions to upload logs to your Amazon S3 bucket.
For more information, see [Create an IAM\
policy](#db2-audit-create-iam-policy).

- The ARNs for the `IAM_ROLE_ARN` and `S3_BUCKET_ARN`
option settings are correct in the option group associated with your
RDS for Db2 DB instance. For more information, see [Configure an option\
group](#db2-audit-configure-options-group).

You can check the task status of your audit logging configuration by connecting to
the database and running a SQL statement. For more information, see [Check the audit\
configuration](#db2-audit-check-config-status).

You can also check events to find out more about why logs might be missing. For
information about how to view events, see [Viewing logs, events, and streams in the Amazon RDS console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/logs-events-streams-console.html).
