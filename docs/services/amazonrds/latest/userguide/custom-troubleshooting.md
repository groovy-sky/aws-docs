# Troubleshooting DB issues for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle

###### Note

End of support notice: On March 31, 2027, AWS will end support for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. After March 31, 2027, you will no longer be able to access the RDS Custom for Oracle console or RDS Custom for Oracle resources. For more information, see [RDS Custom for Oracle end of support](rds-custom-for-oracle-end-of-support.md).

The shared responsibility model of RDS Custom provides OS shell–level access and database administrator access. RDS Custom runs resources in
your account, unlike Amazon RDS, which runs resources in a system account. With greater access comes greater responsibility. In the following
sections, you can learn how to troubleshoot issues with Amazon RDS Custom DB instances.

###### Note

This section explains how to troubleshoot RDS Custom for Oracle. For troubleshooting RDS Custom for SQL Server, see
[Troubleshooting DB issues for Amazon RDS Custom for SQL Server](custom-troubleshooting-sqlserver.md).

## Viewing RDS Custom events

The procedure for viewing events is the same for RDS Custom and Amazon RDS DB instances. For more information, see [Viewing Amazon RDS events](user-listevents.md).

To view RDS Custom event notification using the AWS CLI, use the `describe-events` command. RDS Custom introduces several new
events. The event categories are the same as for Amazon RDS. For the list of events, see [Amazon RDS event categories and event messages](user-events-messages.md).

The following example retrieves details for the events that have occurred for the specified RDS Custom DB instance.

```

aws rds describe-events \
    --source-identifier my-custom-instance \
    --source-type db-instance
```

## Subscribing to RDS Custom events

The procedure for subscribing to events is the same for RDS Custom and Amazon RDS DB instances. For more information, see [Subscribing to Amazon RDS event notification](user-events-subscribing.md).

To subscribe to RDS Custom event notification using the CLI, use the `create-event-subscription` command. Include the
following required parameters:

- `--subscription-name`

- `--sns-topic-arn`

The following example creates a subscription for backup and recovery events for an RDS Custom DB instance in the current AWS
account. Notifications are sent to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic, specified by `--sns-topic-arn`.

```

aws rds create-event-subscription \
    --subscription-name my-instance-events \
    --source-type db-instance \
    --event-categories '["backup","recovery"]' \
    --sns-topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:interesting-events
```

## Troubleshooting DB instance creation issues

If your environment isn't properly configured or required permissions are missing, you
can't create or restore RDS Custom for Oracle DB instances. When you attempt to create or restore a DB instance,
Amazon RDS validates your environment and returns specific error messages if it detects any
issues.

After you resolve all issues, try again to create or restore your RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance.

### Common permissions issues

When you create or restore a RDS Custom for Oracle instance, Amazon RDS validates that your environment
has the required permissions. If permissions are missing or denied, the operation fails
with a specific error message.

Issue typeError messageAction

IAM role access policy

**`You can't create the DB instance because of**
**incompatible resources. The host environment validation failed**
**for the following permissions: <permission> on resource:**
**<resource> due to permissions issue with message: User:**
**<user> is not authorized to perform: <permission> on**
**resource: <resource> because no identity-based policy**
**allows the <permission> action.`**

Ensure that the listed required permissions are present and set to `Allow` in the access policy with the appropriate resources included.

Permission boundary

**`You can't create the DB instance because of**
**incompatible resources. The host environment validation failed**
**for the following permissions: <permission> on resource:**
**<resource> due to permissions issue with message: User:**
**<user> is not authorized to perform: <permission> on**
**resource: <resource> with an explicit deny in a**
**permissions boundary.`**

Verify that the permissions boundary attached to the instance role isn't restricting the listed required permissions and resources.

Service control policy

**`You can't create the DB instance because of**
**incompatible resources. The host environment validation failed**
**for the following permissions: <permission> on resource:**
**<resource> due to permissions issue with message: User:**
**<user> is not authorized to perform: <permission> on**
**resource: <resource> with an explicit deny in a service**
**control policy.`**

Contact your AWS Organizations administrator and verify that the service
control policy attached to your account isn't restricting the listed
required permissions and resources.

Resource control policy

**`You can't create the DB instance because of**
**incompatible resources. The host environment validation failed**
**for the following permissions: <permission> on resource:**
**<resource> due to permissions issue with message: User:**
**<user> is not authorized to perform: <permission> on**
**resource: <resource> with an explicit deny in a resource**
**control policy.`**

Contact your AWS Organizations administrator and verify that the resource
control policy attached to your account isn't restricting the listed
required permissions and resources.

VPC endpoint policy

**`You can't create the DB instance because of**
**incompatible resources. The host environment validation failed**
**for the following permissions: <permission> on resource:**
**<resource> due to permissions issue with message: User:**
**<user> is not authorized to perform: <permission> on**
**resource: <resource> with an explicit deny in a VPC**
**endpoint policy.`**

Ensure that the required VPC endpoints exist and the policies attached to them aren't restricting the listed required permissions and resources.

### Networking issues

In addition to reviewing [Step 6: Configure your VPC for RDS Custom for Oracle](custom-setup-orcl.md#custom-setup-orc.vpc-config), verify that the following are
configured correctly and not restricting access to the required AWS services:

**Security group attached to the Amazon EC2 instance**

Ensure that the security group allows all necessary inbound and outbound
traffic for RDS Custom operations.

**Security group attached to your VPC**

Verify that VPC security groups permit traffic to and from the required AWS services.

**VPC endpoints**

Confirm that all required VPC endpoints are properly configured and accessible.

**Networking access control lists**

Check that network ACLs aren't blocking traffic needed for RDS Custom
functionality.

## Troubleshooting custom engine version creation for RDS Custom for Oracle

When CEV creation fails, RDS Custom issues `RDS-EVENT-0198` with the message `Creation failed for custom engine
        version major-engine-version.cev_name`, and includes details about the failure. For
example, the event prints missing files.

CEV creation might fail because of the following issues:

- The Amazon S3 bucket containing your installation files isn't in the same AWS Region as your CEV.

- When you request CEV creation in an AWS Region for the first time, RDS Custom creates an S3 bucket for storing RDS Custom
resources (such as CEV artifacts, AWS CloudTrail logs, and transaction logs).

CEV creation fails if RDS Custom can't create the S3 bucket. Either the caller doesn't have S3 permissions as described in
[Step 5: Grant required permissions to your IAM user or role](custom-setup-orcl.md#custom-setup-orcl.iam-user), or the number of S3 buckets
has reached the limit.

- The caller doesn't have permissions to get files from your S3 bucket that contains the installation media files. These
permissions are described in [Step 7: Add necessary IAM permissions](custom-cev-preparing.md#custom-cev.preparing.iam).

- Your IAM policy has an `aws:SourceIp` condition. Make sure to follow the recommendations in [AWS Denies access to\
AWS based on the source IP](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-examples-aws-deny-ip.md) in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide_. Also make sure that the
caller has the S3 permissions described in [Step 5: Grant required permissions to your IAM user or role](custom-setup-orcl.md#custom-setup-orcl.iam-user).

- Installation media files listed in the CEV manifest aren't in your S3 bucket.

- The SHA-256 checksums of the installation files are unknown to RDS Custom.

Confirm that the SHA-256 checksums of the provided files match the SHA-256 checksum on the Oracle website. If the
checksums match, contact [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport) and provide the failed CEV
name, file name, and checksum.

- The OPatch version is incompatible with your patch files. You might get the following message: `OPatch is lower than
                  minimum required version. Check that the version meets the requirements for all patches, and try again`. To apply an
Oracle patch, you must use a compatible version of the OPatch utility. You can find the required version of the Opatch utility in
the readme file for the patch. Download the most recent OPatch utility from My Oracle Support, and try creating your CEV
again.

- The patches specified in the CEV manifest are in the wrong order.

You can view RDS events either on the RDS console (in the navigation pane, choose **Events**) or by using the
`describe-events` AWS CLI command. The default duration is 60 minutes. If no events are returned, specify a longer
duration, as shown in the following example.

```

aws rds describe-events --duration 360
```

Currently, the MediaImport service that imports files from Amazon S3 to create CEVs isn't integrated with AWS CloudTrail. Therefore,
if you turn on data logging for Amazon RDS in CloudTrail, calls to the MediaImport service such as the
`CreateCustomDbEngineVersion` event aren't logged.

However, you might see calls from the API gateway that accesses your Amazon S3 bucket. These calls come from the MediaImport
service for the `CreateCustomDbEngineVersion` event.

## Fixing unsupported configurations in RDS Custom for Oracle

In the shared responsibility model, it's your responsibility to fix configuration
issues that put your RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance into the `unsupported-configuration` state.
If the issue is with the AWS infrastructure, use the console or the AWS CLI to fix it. If
the issue is with the operating system or the database configuration, log in to the host to
fix it.

###### Note

This section explains how to fix unsupported configurations in RDS Custom for Oracle. For
information about RDS Custom for SQL Server, see [Fixing unsupported configurations in RDS Custom for SQL Server](custom-troubleshooting-sqlserver.md#custom-troubleshooting-sqlserver.fix-unsupported).

The following tables includes descriptions of the notifications and events that the
support perimeter sends and how to fix them. These notifications and the support perimeter
are subject to change. For background on the support perimeter, see [RDS Custom support perimeter](custom-concept.md#custom-troubleshooting.support-perimeter). For event descriptions, see
[Amazon RDS event categories and event messages](user-events-messages.md).

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes

**`The following EBS volumes were added to EC2 instance**
**ec2_id: volume_id.**
**To resolve the issue, detach the specified volumes from the**
**instance.`**

RDS Custom creates two types of EBS volume, besides the root volume created from the Amazon
Machine Image (AMI), and associates them with the EC2 instance:

- The binary volume where the database software binaries are located

- The data volumes where database files are located

When you create your DB instance, the storage configurations that you specify configure the data
volumes.

The support perimeter monitors the following:

- The initial EBS volumes created with the DB instance are still associated with the
instance.

- The initial EBS volumes still have the same configurations as initially set:
storage type, size, Provisioned IOPS, and storage throughput.

- No additional EBS volumes are attached to the DB instance.

Use the following CLI command to compare the volume type of the EBS volume details and the
RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance details:

```

aws rds describe-db-instances \
    --db-instance-identifier db-instance-name | grep StorageType
```

**`SP-O1002`**

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes

**`EBS volume volume_id has been**
**detached from EC2 instance [ec2_id]. You**

To check the status of a DB instance, use the console or run the following
AWS CLI command:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances \
    --db-instance-identifier db-instance-name |grep DBInstanceStatus
```

**`SP-O1005`**

Amazon EC2 instance attributes

**`SP-O1006`**

Amazon EC2 instance state

**`EC2 instance [ec2_id] was**
**terminated or can't be found. To resolve the issue, delete the RDS Custom**
**DB instance.`**

The support perimeter monitors EC2 instance state-change
notifications. The EC2 instance must always be running.

###### To delete your DB instance

1. To check the status of a DB instance, use the console or run the
    following AWS CLI command:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances \
       --db-instance-identifier db-instance-name |grep DBInstanceStatus
```

2. Delete your RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance.

**`SP-O1007`**

Amazon EC2 instance state

**`EC2 instance [ec2_id] was**
**stopped. To resolve the issue, start the instance.`**

The support perimeter monitors EC2 instance state-change

###### To restart your DB instance

1. To check the status of a DB instance, use the console or run the
    following AWS CLI command:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances \
       --db-instance-identifier db-instance-name |grep DBInstanceStatus
```

2. Start your DB instance.

3. Remount the binary and data volumes.

Amazon SQS permission

**`Permissions are missing for Amazon SQS. Check the permissions**
**for the IAM instance profile, VPC endpoint policy, and dependent service**
**connections, and then try again.`**

You can resolve this by making sure the IAM profile associated with
the host has the following permissions:

```

"SQS:SendMessage"
"SQS:ReceiveMessage"
"SQS:DeleteMessage"
"SQS:GetQueueUrl"
```

**`SP-1009`**

RDS Custom agent status

**`The RDS Custom agent isn't running on EC2 instance**
**[ec2_id]. Make sure the agent is running on**
**[ec2_id].`**

On RDS Custom for Oracle, the DB instance goes outside the support perimeter if the
RDS Custom agent stops. The agent publishes the `IamAlive` metric
to Amazon CloudWatch every 30 seconds. An alarm is triggered if the metric
hasn't been published for 30 seconds. The support perimeter also
monitors the RDS Custom agent process state on the host every 30
minutes.

###### To restart the RDS Custom agent

1. Log in to your host and make sure that the RDS Custom agent is
    running.

2. Run the following command to find the status of the
    agent.

```

service rdscustomagent status
```

3. Use the following command to start the agent.

```

service rdscustomagent start
```

When the RDS Custom agent is running again, the `IamAlive`
metric is published to Amazon CloudWatch, and the alarm switches to the
`OK` state. This switch notifies the support perimeter that
the agent is running.

`SP-O2002`

AWS Systems Manager agent (SSM agent) status

**`The Systems Manager agent on EC2 instance**
**[ec2_id] is unreachable. Make sure that you**
**that have correctly configured the network, agent, and IAM permissions.**
**`**

SSM Agent must always be running. The RDS Custom agent is responsible
for making sure that the Systems Manager agent is running. If SSM Agent was
terminated and then restarted, the RDS Custom agent publishes the metric
`SSM_Agent_Restarted_Or_NotFound` to CloudWatch. The RDS Custom
agent has an alarm on the metric
`do-not-delete-rds-custom-ssm-agent-restarted-or-notfound-ec2-id`
configured to trigger when there has been a restart in each of the
previous three minutes. The support perimeter also monitors the process
state of SSM Agent on the host every 30 minutes.

For more information, see [Troubleshooting SSM Agent](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-ssm-agent.md).

`SP-O2003`

AWS Systems Manager agent (SSM agent) status

**`The Systems Manager agent on EC2 instance**
**[ec2_id] crashed multiple times. For more**
**information, see the SSM Agent troubleshooting**
**documentation.`**

**`SP-O2004`**

OS time zone

**`The time zone on EC2 instance**
**[ec2_id] was changed. To resolve this issue,**
**revert the timezone to the previous setting of**
**[previous-time-zone]. Then use an RDS options**
**group to change the time zone.`**

RDS automation detected that the time zone on the host was changed
without the use of an option group. This host-level change can cause RDS
automation failures, so the EC2 instance is placed in the
`unsupported-configuration` state.

###### To fix the time zone setting

1. Log in to your EC2 host and check the OS time zone as
    follows:

```

timedatectl
```

2. Pause RDS Custom automation. For more information, see [Pausing and resuming your RDS Custom DB instance](custom-managing-customizing-env.md#custom-managing.pausing).

3. Stop the DB instance.

4. Revert the time zone change on the operating system.

5. Start the DB instance.

6. Resume RDS Custom automation.

Your DB instance becomes available within 30 minutes. To prevent moving out
of perimeter in the future, modify your timezone through an options
group. For more information, see [Oracle time zone](custom-managing-timezone.md).

**`SP-O2005`**

`sudo` configurations

**`The sudo configurations on EC2 instance**
**[ec2_id] lack necessary permissions. To**
**resolve this issue, revert the recent changes to the sudo**
**configurations.`**

The support perimeter verifies that certain OS users are allowed to
run certain commands on the host. It monitors `sudo`
configurations and compares them to the supported state.

If the `sudo` configurations aren't supported, RDS Custom
tries to overwrite them and return to the previous supported state. If
the attempt is successful, RDS Custom sends the following
notification:

**`RDS Custom successfully overwrote your**
**configuration.`**

If the overwrite isn't successful, your DB instance remains in the
unsupported configuration state. To resolve this problem, either revert
the changes within the `sudoers.d/` file or fix the
permissions.

###### To investigate changes to the `sudo` configurations

1. Log in to your host.

2. Run the following command.

```nohighlight

visudo -c -f /etc/sudoers.d/individual_sudo_files
```

3. Modify the `sudo` configurations as
    necessary.

After the support perimeter determines that the `sudo`
configurations are supported, your RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance becomes available
within 30 minutes.

**`SP-O2006`**

S3 bucket accessibility

**`RDS Custom automation can't download files from the S3 bucket**
**on EC2 instance [ec2_id]. Check your**
**networking configuration and make sure the instance allows connections**
**to and from S3. `**

**`SP-2007`**

**`The ARCHIVE_LAG_TARGET parameter on EC2 instance**
**[ec2_id] is out of the recommended**
**range value_range. To resolve the issue,**
**set the parameter to a value within value_range. `**

The support perimeter monitors the `ARCHIVE_LAG_TARGET`
database parameter to verify that the latest restorable time of the
DB instance is within reasonable bounds.

###### To change the lag target for archived redo logs

1. Log in to your EC2 host

2. Connect to your RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance

3. Change the `ARCHIVE_LAG_TARGET` parameter to a
    value from 60–7200. For example, use the following SQL
    statement.

```

ALTER SYSTEM SET ARCHIVE_LAG_TARGET=300 SCOPE=BOTH;
```

Your DB instance becomes available within 30 minutes.

**`SP-O3002`**

Oracle Data Guard role

**`The database role [role_name]**
**isn't supported for Oracle Data Guard on EC2 instance**
**[ec2_id]. To resolve the issue, set**
**the DATABASE_ROLE parameter to either PRIMARY or PHYSICAL**
**STANDBY.`**

The support perimeter monitors the current database role every 15
seconds and sends a CloudWatch notification if the database role has changed.
The Oracle Data Guard `DATABASE_ROLE` parameter must be
either `PRIMARY` or `PHYSICAL STANDBY`.

###### To restore your Oracle Data Guard database role to a supported value

1. Check the Oracle Data Guard role by running the following
    statement:

```

SELECT DATABASE_ROLE FROM V$DATABASE;
```

2. If your DB instance is standalone, use either of the following
    statements to change it back to the `PRIMARY`
    role:

```

ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER PRIMARY;
ALTER DATABASE ACTIVATE STANDBY DATABASE;
```

If your DB instance is a replica, use the following statement to
    change it back to the `PHYSICAL STANDBY` role:

```

ALTER DATABASE CONVERT TO PHYSICAL STANDBY;
```

After the support perimeter determines that the database role is
supported, your RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance becomes available within 15
seconds.

**`SP-O3003`**

Database health

**`The SMON process of the Oracle database is in a zombie**
**state. To resolve the issue, manually recover the database on EC2**
**instance [ec2_id], open the database, and**
**then immediately back it up. For more help, contact**
**Support.`**

The support perimeter monitors the DB instance state. It also monitors how
many restarts occurred during the previous hour and day. You're
notified when the instance is in a state where it still exists, but you
can't interact with it.

###### To make the support perimeter evaluate your instance state

1. Log in to your host and determine the database state.

```

ps -eo pid,state,command | grep smon
```

2. If necessary, restart your DB instance. If the restart fails,
    proceed to the next step.

3. If necessary, restart your EC2 host.

After your DB instance restarts, the RDS Custom agent detects that your DB instance is
no longer in an unresponsive state. It then notifies the support
perimeter to reevaluate your DB instance state.

**`SP-O3004`**

Database log mode

**`The database log mode on EC2 instance**
**[ec2_id] was changed to**
**[value_b]. To resolve the issue, set**
**the log mode to [value_a].**
**`**

###### To change your DB instance log mode to `ARCHIVELOG`

1. Log in to your EC2 host.

2. Connect to your database and run the following
    statement:

```

SELECT LOG_MODE FROM V$DATABASE;
```

Or you can run the follow command in SQL\*Plus:

```

ARCHIVE LOG LIST
```

3. Run the following SQL\*Plus command to initiate a consistent
    shutdown.

```

SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE
```

The RDS Custom agent automatically restarts your DB instance and sets the log
mode to `ARCHIVELOG`. Your DB instance becomes available within 30
minutes.

**`SP-O3005`**

Oracle home path

**`The Oracle home on EC2 instance**
**[ec2_id] was changed to**
**new_path. To resolve the issue,**
**revert the setting to**
**old_path.`**

**`SP-O3006`**

Database unique name

**`The database unique name on EC2 instance**
**[ec2_id] was changed to**
**new_value. To resolve the issue,**
**revert the name to old_value.**
**`**

###### To change the database unique name for your DB instance

1. Log in to your EC2 host.

2. Connect to the database and run the following
    statement:

```

SELECT DB_UNIQUE_NAME FROM V$DATABASE;
```

3. Specify the original database unique name using the command
    `ALTER SYSTEM SET DB_UNIQUE_NAME`.

4. Run the following SQL statement to initiate a consistent
    shutdown.

```

SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
```

The RDS Custom agent automatically restarts your DB instance and sets the log
mode to `ARCHIVELOG`. Your DB instance becomes available within 30
minutes.

## Troubleshooting upgrades for RDS Custom for Oracle

Your upgrade of an RDS Custom for Oracle instance might fail. Following, you can find techniques that you can use during upgrades of RDS Custom DB for
Oracle DB instances:

- Examine the upgrade output log files in the `/tmp` directory on
your DB instance. The names of the logs depend on your DB engine version. For example, you
might see logs that contain the strings `catupgrd` or
`catup`.

- Examine the `alert.log` file located in the
`/rdsdbdata/log/trace` directory.

- Run the following `grep` command in the `root` directory to track the upgrade OS process. This command
shows where the log files are being written and determine the state of the upgrade process.

```

ps -aux | grep upg
```

The following shows sample output.

- Run the following SQL query to verify the current state of the components to find the database version and the options installed on
the DB instance.

```

SET LINESIZE 180
COLUMN COMP_ID FORMAT A15
COLUMN COMP_NAME FORMAT A40 TRUNC
COLUMN STATUS FORMAT A15 TRUNC
SELECT COMP_ID, COMP_NAME, VERSION, STATUS FROM DBA_REGISTRY ORDER BY 1;
```

The output resembles the following.

```

COMP_NAME                                STATUS               PROCEDURE

## Troubleshooting replica promotion for RDS Custom for Oracle

You can promote managed Oracle replicas in RDS Custom for Oracle using the console,
`promote-read-replica` AWS CLI command, or `PromoteReadReplica` API.
If you delete your primary DB instance, and all replicas are healthy, RDS Custom for Oracle promotes
your managed replicas to standalone instances automatically. If a replica has paused
automation or is outside the support perimeter, you must fix the replica before RDS Custom can
promote it automatically. For more information, see [Promoting an RDS Custom for Oracle replica to a standalone DB instance](custom-rr-promoting.md).

The replica promotion workflow might become stuck in the following situation:

- The primary DB instance is in the state `STORAGE_FULL`.

- The primary database can't archive all of its online redo logs.

- A gap exists between the archived redo log files on your Oracle replica and the primary database.

###### To respond to the stuck workflow

1. Synchronize the redo log gap on your Oracle replica DB instance.

2. Force the promotion of your read replica to the latest applied redo log. Run the following commands in SQL\*Plus:

```

ALTER DATABASE ACTIVATE STANDBY DATABASE;
SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE
STARTUP
```

3. Contact Support and ask them to move your DB instance to `available`
    status.
