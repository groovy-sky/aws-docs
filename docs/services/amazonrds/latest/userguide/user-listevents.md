# Viewing Amazon RDS events

You can retrieve the following event information for your Amazon RDS resources:

- Resource name

- Resource type

- Time of the event

- Message summary of the event

You can access events in the following parts of the AWS Management Console:

- The **Events** tab, which shows events from the past 24 hours.

- The **Recent events** table in the **Logs & events**
section in the **Databases** tab, which can show events for up to the past 2 weeks.

You can also retrieve events by using the [describe-events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-events.html) AWS CLI command, or the [DescribeEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEvents.html) RDS API operation. If you use the AWS CLI or the RDS API to view events,
you can retrieve events for up to the past 14 days.

###### Note

If you need to store events for longer periods of time, you can send Amazon RDS events to EventBridge. For more information, see [Creating a rule that triggers on an Amazon RDS event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-cloud-watch-events.html)

For descriptions of the Amazon RDS events, see [Amazon RDS event categories and event messages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Events.Messages.html).

To access detailed information about events using AWS CloudTrail, including request parameters, see [CloudTrail events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html#service-name-info-in-cloudtrail.events).

###### To view all Amazon RDS events for the past 24 hours

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Events**.

The available events appear in a list.

3. (Optional) Enter a search term to filter your results.

The following example shows a list of events filtered by the characters `stopped`.

![List DB events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/ListEvents.png)

To view all events generated in the last hour, call [describe-events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-events.html) with
no parameters.

```

aws rds describe-events
```

The following sample output shows that a DB instance has been stopped.

```

{
    "Events": [
        {
            "EventCategories": [
                "notification"
            ],
            "SourceType": "db-instance",
            "SourceArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:db:testinst",
            "Date": "2022-04-22T21:31:00.681Z",
            "Message": "DB instance stopped",
            "SourceIdentifier": "testinst"
        }
    ]
}
```

To view all Amazon RDS events for the past 10080 minutes (7 days), call the [describe-events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-events.html) AWS CLI command and set the `--duration` parameter to `10080`.

```

aws rds describe-events --duration 10080
```

The following example shows the events in the specified time range for DB instance `test-instance`.

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-events \
    --source-identifier test-instance \
    --source-type db-instance \
    --start-time 2022-03-13T22:00Z \
    --end-time 2022-03-13T23:59Z
```

The following sample output shows the status of a backup.

```

{
    "Events": [
        {
            "SourceType": "db-instance",
            "SourceIdentifier": "test-instance",
            "EventCategories": [
                "backup"
            ],
            "Message": "Backing up DB instance",
            "Date": "2022-03-13T23:09:23.983Z",
            "SourceArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:db:test-instance"
        },
        {
            "SourceType": "db-instance",
            "SourceIdentifier": "test-instance",
            "EventCategories": [
                "backup"
            ],
            "Message": "Finished DB Instance backup",
            "Date": "2022-03-13T23:15:13.049Z",
            "SourceArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:db:test-instance"
        }
    ]
}
```

You can view all Amazon RDS instance events for the past 14 days by calling the [DescribeEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEvents.html) RDS API operation and setting the
`Duration` parameter to `20160`.
