# Finding the connection information for a MariaDB DB instance

The connection information for a DB instance includes its endpoint, port, and a valid database user, such
as the master user. For example, suppose that an endpoint value is `mydb.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`.
In this case, the port value is `3306`, and the database user is `admin`. Given this information, you specify the following
values in a connection string:

- For host or host name or DNS name, specify
`mydb.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`.

- For port, specify `3306`.

- For user, specify `admin`.

To connect to a DB instance, use any client for the MariaDB DB engine. For example, you might use the MySQL command-line client or MySQL Workbench.

To find the connection information for a DB instance, you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
[describe-db-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.md) command, or the Amazon RDS API
[DescribeDBInstances](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbinstances.md) operation
to list its details.

###### To find the connection information for a DB instance in the AWS Management Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases** to display a list of your DB instances.

3. Choose the name of the MariaDB DB instance to display its details.

4. On the **Connectivity & security** tab, copy the endpoint.
    Also, note the port number. You need both the endpoint and the port number
    to connect to the DB instance.

5. If you need to find the master user name, choose the
    **Configuration** tab and view the **Master**
**username** value.

To find the connection information for a MariaDB DB instance by using the
AWS CLI, run the [describe-db-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.md) command. In the call, query for the DB
instance ID, endpoint, port, and master user name.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances \
  --filters "Name=engine,Values=mariadb" \
  --query "*[].[DBInstanceIdentifier,Endpoint.Address,Endpoint.Port,MasterUsername]"
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances ^
  --filters "Name=engine,Values=mariadb" ^
  --query "*[].[DBInstanceIdentifier,Endpoint.Address,Endpoint.Port,MasterUsername]"
```

Your output should be similar to the following.

```nohighlight

[
    [
        "mydb1",
        "mydb1.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
        3306,
        "admin"
    ],
    [
        "mydb2",
        "mydb2.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
        3306,
        "admin"
    ]
]
```

To find the connection information for a DB instance by using the Amazon RDS API,
call the [DescribeDBInstances](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbinstances.md) operation. In the output, find the values for
the endpoint address, endpoint port, and master user name.
