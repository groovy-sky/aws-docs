# Install a web server on your EC2 instance

Install a web server on the EC2 instance you created in
[Launch an EC2 instance to connect with your DB instance](chap-tutorials-webserverdb-launchec2.md). The web server connects to the Amazon RDS DB
instance that you created in [Create an Amazon RDS DB instance](chap-tutorials-webserverdb-createdbinstance.md).

## Install an Apache web server with PHP and MariaDB

Connect to your EC2 instance and install the web server.

###### To connect to your EC2 instance and install the Apache web server with PHP

1. Connect to the EC2 instance that you created earlier by following the steps in
    [Connect to your Linux\
    instance](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/accessinginstances.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

We recommend that you connect to your EC2 instance using SSH. If the SSH client utility is
    installed on Windows, Linux, or Mac, you can connect to the instance using the
    following command format:

```nohighlight

ssh -i location_of_pem_file ec2-user@ec2-instance-public-dns-name
```

For example, assume that `ec2-database-connect-key-pair.pem` is stored
    in `/dir1` on Linux, and the public IPv4 DNS for your EC2 instance is
    `ec2-12-345-678-90.compute-1.amazonaws.com`. Your SSH command would
    look as follows:

```

ssh -i /dir1/ec2-database-connect-key-pair.pem ec2-user@ec2-12-345-678-90.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

2. Get the latest bug fixes and security updates by updating the software on your EC2 instance.
    To do this, use the following command.

###### Note

The `-y` option installs the updates without asking for confirmation. To
examine updates before installing, omit this option.

```nohighlight

sudo dnf update -y
```

3. After the updates complete, install the Apache web server, PHP, and
    MariaDB or PostgreSQL software using the following commands. This command
    installs multiple software packages and related dependencies at the same
    time.
MariaDB & MySQL

```nohighlight

sudo dnf install -y httpd php php-mysqli mariadb105
```

PostgreSQL

```

sudo dnf install -y httpd php php-pgsql postgresql15
```

If you receive an error, your instance probably wasn't launched with an
    Amazon Linux 2023 AMI. You might be using the Amazon Linux 2 AMI instead. You can
    view your version of Amazon Linux using the following command.

```

cat /etc/system-release
```

For more information, see [Updating instance software](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/install-updates.md).

4. Start the web server with the command shown following.

```nohighlight

sudo systemctl start httpd
```

You can test that your web server is properly installed and started. To do
    this, enter the public Domain Name System (DNS) name of your EC2 instance in
    the address bar of a web browser, for example:
    `http://ec2-42-8-168-21.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com`. If
    your web server is running, then you see the Apache test page.

If you don't see the Apache test page, check your inbound rules for the
    VPC security group that you created in [Tutorial: Create a VPC for use with a DB instance (IPv4 only)](chap-tutorials-webserverdb-createvpc.md). Make sure that
    your inbound rules include one allowing HTTP (port 80) access for the IP
    address to connect to the web server.

###### Note

The Apache test page appears only when there is no content in the
document root directory, `/var/www/html`. After you add
content to the document root directory, your content appears at the
public DNS address of your EC2 instance. Before this point, it appears
on the Apache test page.

5. Configure the web server to start with each system boot using the `systemctl`
    command.

```nohighlight

sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

To allow `ec2-user` to manage files in the default root directory for
your Apache web server, modify the ownership and permissions of the
`/var/www` directory. There are many ways to accomplish this task. In this tutorial,
you add `ec2-user` to the `apache` group, to give the `apache` group
ownership of the `/var/www` directory and assign write permissions to the group.

###### To set file permissions for the Apache web server

1. Add the `ec2-user` user to the `apache` group.

```nohighlight

sudo usermod -a -G apache ec2-user
```

2. Log out to refresh your permissions and include the new `apache` group.

```nohighlight

exit
```

3. Log back in again and verify that the `apache` group exists with the
    `groups` command.

```nohighlight

groups
```

Your output looks similar to the following:

```nohighlight

ec2-user adm wheel apache systemd-journal
```

4. Change the group ownership of the `/var/www` directory and its contents to the
    `apache` group.

```nohighlight

sudo chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www
```

5. Change the directory permissions of `/var/www` and its subdirectories to add group
    write permissions and set the group ID on subdirectories created in the
    future.

```nohighlight

sudo chmod 2775 /var/www
find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} \;
```

6. Recursively change the permissions for files in the `/var/www` directory and its
    subdirectories to add group write permissions.

```nohighlight

find /var/www -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} \;
```

Now, `ec2-user` (and any future members of the `apache`
group) can add, delete, and edit files in the Apache document root. This makes it
possible for you to add content, such as a static website or a PHP application.

###### Note

A web server running the HTTP protocol provides no transport security for the
data that it sends or receives. When you connect to an HTTP server using a web
browser, much information is visible to eavesdroppers anywhere along the network
pathway. This information includes the URLs that you visit, the content of
web pages that you receive, and the contents (including passwords) of any HTML
forms.

The best practice for securing your web server is to install support for HTTPS
(HTTP Secure). This protocol protects your data with SSL/TLS encryption. For
more information, see [Tutorial:\
Configure SSL/TLS with the Amazon Linux AMI](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ssl-on-amazon-linux-ami.md) in the _Amazon EC2_
_User Guide_.

## Connect your Apache web server to your DB instance

Next, you add content to your Apache web server that connects to your Amazon RDS DB instance.

###### To add content to the Apache web server that connects to your DB instance

1. While still connected to your EC2 instance, change the directory to
    `/var/www` and create a new subdirectory named
    `inc`.

```nohighlight

cd /var/www
mkdir inc
cd inc
```

2. Create a new file in the `inc` directory named
    `dbinfo.inc`, and then edit the file by calling nano (or the
    editor of your choice).

```nohighlight

>dbinfo.inc
nano dbinfo.inc
```

3. Add the following contents to the `dbinfo.inc` file. Here,
    `db_instance_endpoint` is your DB instance endpoint, without the
    port, for your DB instance.

###### Note

We recommend placing the user name and password information in a
folder that isn't part of the document root for your web server. Doing
this reduces the possibility of your security information being
exposed.

Make sure to change `master password` to a suitable
password in your application.

```php

<?php

define('DB_SERVER', 'db_instance_endpoint');
define('DB_USERNAME', 'tutorial_user');
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'master password');
define('DB_DATABASE', 'sample');
?>
```

4. Save and close the `dbinfo.inc` file. If you are using nano,
    save and close the file by using Ctrl+S and Ctrl+X.

5. Change the directory to `/var/www/html`.

```nohighlight

cd /var/www/html
```

6. Create a new file in the `html` directory named
    `SamplePage.php`, and then edit the file by calling nano (or
    the editor of your choice).

```nohighlight

>SamplePage.php
nano SamplePage.php
```

7. Add the following contents to the `SamplePage.php` file:
MariaDB & MySQL

```php

<?php include "../inc/dbinfo.inc"; ?>

8. Save and close the `SamplePage.php` file.

9. Verify that your web server successfully connects to your DB instance by opening a web browser and browsing to
    `http://EC2 instance
                               endpoint/SamplePage.php`, for example:
    `http://ec2-12-345-67-890.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/SamplePage.php`.

You can use `SamplePage.php` to add data to your DB instance. The data that you add is then displayed on the page. To
verify that the data was inserted into the table, install MySQL client on the Amazon EC2
instance. Then connect to the DB instance and query the
table.

For information about installing the MySQL client and
connecting to a DB instance, see [Connecting to your MySQL DB instance](user-connecttoinstance.md).

To make sure that your DB instance is as secure as possible, verify that
sources outside of the VPC can't connect to your DB instance.

After you have finished testing your web server and your database, you should
delete your DB instance and your Amazon EC2 instance.

- To delete a DB instance, follow the instructions in [Deleting a DB instance](user-deleteinstance.md). You
don't need to create a final snapshot.

- To terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, follow the instruction in [Terminate your\
instance](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/terminating-instances.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.
