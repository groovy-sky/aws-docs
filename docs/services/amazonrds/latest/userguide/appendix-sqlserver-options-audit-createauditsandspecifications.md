# Using SQL Server Audit

You can control server audits, server audit specifications, and database audit
specifications the same way that you control them for on-premises database
servers.

## Creating audits

You create server audits in the same way that you create them for on-premises database
servers. For information about how to create server audits, see [CREATE SERVER AUDIT](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-server-audit-transact-sql) in the Microsoft SQL Server documentation.

To avoid errors, adhere to the following limitations:

- Don't exceed the maximum number of supported server audits per instance of
50\.

- Instruct SQL Server to write data to a binary file.

- Don't use `RDS_` as a prefix in the server audit name.

- For `FILEPATH`, specify
`D:\rdsdbdata\SQLAudit`.

- For `MAXSIZE`, specify a size between 2 MB and 50 MB.

- Don't configure `MAX_ROLLOVER_FILES` or
`MAX_FILES`.

- Don't configure SQL Server to shut down the DB instance if it fails to write
the audit record.

## Creating audit specifications

You create server audit specifications and database audit specifications the same way that
you create them for on-premises database servers. For information about creating
audit specifications, see [CREATE SERVER AUDIT SPECIFICATION](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-server-audit-specification-transact-sql) and [CREATE DATABASE AUDIT SPECIFICATION](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/create-database-audit-specification-transact-sql) in the Microsoft SQL Server
documentation.

To avoid errors, don't use `RDS_` as a prefix in the name of the database
audit specification or server audit specification.
