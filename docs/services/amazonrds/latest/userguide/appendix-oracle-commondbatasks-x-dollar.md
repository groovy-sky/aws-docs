# Managing RDS\_X$ views for Oracle DB instances

You might need to access `SYS.X$` fixed tables, which are only accessible
by `SYS`. To create `SYS.RDS_X$` views on eligible `X$`
tables, use the procedures in the `rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util` package. Your master
user is automatically granted the privilege `SELECT … WITH GRANT OPTION` on the
`RDS_X$` views.

The `rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util` procedures are available in the following cases:

- Existing DB instances that have never been upgraded and use the following releases:

- `21.0.0.0.ru-2023-10.rur-2023-10.r1` and higher 21c releases

- `19.0.0.0.ru-2023-10.rur-2023-10.r1` and higher 19c releases

- Any new DB instance that you create

- Any existing DB instance that you have upgraded

###### Important

Internally, the `rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util` package creates views on
`X$` tables. The `X$` tables are internal system objects that
aren’t described in the Oracle Database documentation. We recommend that you test
specific views in your non-production database and only create views in your production
database under the guidance of Oracle Support.

## List X$ fixed tables eligible for use in RDS\_X$ views

To list X$ tables that are eligible for use in `RDS_X$` views, use the
RDS procedure `rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.list_allowed_sys_x$_views`. This
procedure accepts no parameters. The following statements lists all eligible
`X$` tables (sample output included).

```nohighlight

SQL> SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
SQL> SELECT * FROM TABLE(rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.list_allowed_sys_x$_views);

'X$BH'
'X$K2GTE'
'X$KCBWBPD'
'X$KCBWDS'
'X$KGLLK'
'X$KGLOB'
'X$KGLPN'
'X$KSLHOT'
'X$KSMSP'
'X$KSPPCV'
'X$KSPPI'
'X$KSPPSV'
'X$KSQEQ'
'X$KSQRS'
'X$KTUXE'
'X$KQRFP'
```

The list of eligible `X$` tables can change over time. To make sure
that your list of eligible `X$` fixed tables is current, rerun
`list_allowed_sys_x$_views` periodically.

## Creating SYS.RDS\_X$ views

To create an `RDS_X$` view on an eligible `X$` table, use
the RDS procedure `rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.create_sys_x$_view`. You can only
create views for the tables listed in the output of
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.list_allowed_sys_x$_views`. The
`create_sys_x$_view` procedure accepts the following parameters.

Parameter nameData typeDefaultRequiredDescription

`p_x$_tbl`

varchar2

Null

Yes

A valid `X$` table name. The value must be one of the
`X$` tables reported by
`list_allowed_sys_x$_views`.

`p_force_creation`

Boolean

`FALSE`

No

A value indicating whether to force creation of an
`RDS_X$` view that already exists for an
`X$` table. By default, RDS won't create a view if it
already exists. To force creation, set this parameter to
`TRUE`.

The following example creates the `SYS.RDS_X$KGLOB` view on the table
`X$KGLOB`. The format for the view name is
`RDS_X$tablename`.

```nohighlight

SQL> SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
SQL> EXEC rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.create_sys_x$_view('X$KGLOB');

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
```

The following data dictionary query lists the view `SYS.RDS_X$KGLOB`
and shows its status. Your master user is automatically granted the privilege
`SELECT ... WITH GRANT OPTION` on this view.

```nohighlight

SQL> SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
SQL> COL OWNER FORMAT A30
SQL> COL OBJECT_NAME FORMAT A30
SQL> COL STATUS FORMAT A30
SQL> SET LINESIZE 200
SQL> SELECT OWNER, OBJECT_NAME, STATUS
FROM DBA_OBJECTS
WHERE OWNER = 'SYS' AND OBJECT_NAME = 'RDS_X$KGLOB';

OWNER                          OBJECT_NAME                    STATUS
------------------------------ ------------------------------ ------------------------------
SYS                            RDS_X$KGLOB                    VALID
```

###### Important

`X$` tables aren't guaranteed to stay the same before and after an
upgrade. RDS for Oracle drops and recreates the `RDS_X$` views on
`X$` tables during an engine upgrade. Then it grants the `SELECT
                    ... WITH GRANT OPTION` privilege to the master user. After an upgrade,
grant privileges to database users as needed on the corresponding
`RDS_X$` views.

## Listing SYS.RDS\_X$ views

To list existing `RDS_X$` views, use the RDS procedure
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.list_created_sys_x$_views`. The procedure lists
only views that were created by the procedure `create_sys_x$_view`. The
following example lists `X$` tables that have corresponding
`RDS_X$` views (sample output included).

```nohighlight

SQL> SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
SQL> COL XD_TBL_NAME FORMAT A30
SQL> COL STATUS FORMAT A30
SQL> SET LINESIZE 200
SQL> SELECT * FROM TABLE(rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.list_created_sys_x$_views);

XD_TBL_NAME                    STATUS
------------------------------ ------------------------------
X$BH                           VALID
X$K2GTE                        VALID
X$KCBWBPD                      VALID

3 rows selected.
```

## Dropping RDS\_X$ views

To drop a `SYS.RDS_X$` view, use the RDS procedure
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.drop_sys_x$_view`. You can only drop views listed
in the output of `rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.list_allowed_sys_x$_views`. The
`drop_sys_x$_view` procedure accepts the following parameter.

Parameter nameData typeDefaultRequiredDescription

`p_x$_tbl`

varchar2

Null

Yes

A valid `X$` fixed table name. The value must be one of
the `X$` fixed tables reported by
`list_created_sys_x$_views`.

The following example drops the `RDS_X$KGLOB` view, which was created
on the table `X$KGLOB`.

```nohighlight

SQL> SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
SQL> EXEC rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.drop_sys_x$_view('X$KGLOB');

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
```

The following example shows that the view `SYS.RDS_X$KGLOB` has been
dropped (sample output included).

```nohighlight

SQL> SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
SQL> COL OWNER FORMAT A30
SQL> COL OBJECT_NAME FORMAT A30
SQL> COL STATUS FORMAT A30
SQL> SET LINESIZE 200
SQL> SELECT OWNER, OBJECT_NAME, STATUS
FROM DBA_OBJECTS
WHERE OWNER = 'SYS' AND OBJECT_NAME = 'RDS_X$KGLOB';

no rows selected
```
