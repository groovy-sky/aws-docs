# Turning on the Advanced mode of Database Insights for Amazon RDS

To turn on the Advanced mode of Database Insights for Amazon RDS, use the following procedures.

## Turning on the Advanced mode of Database Insights when creating a DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster

Turn on the Advanced mode of Database Insights when creating a database for Amazon RDS.

Console

In the console, you can turn on the Advanced mode of Database Insights when you
create a DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster.

###### To turn on the Advanced mode of Database Insights when creating a DB instance or Multi-AZDB cluster using the console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose **Databases**.

3. Choose **Create database**.

4. In the **Database Insights** section, select **Advanced mode**. Then, choose the following options:

- **Retention** – The amount of time to retain Performance Insights data. The retention period must be 15 months for the Advanced mode of Database Insights.

- **AWS KMS key** – Specify your
KMS key. Performance Insights encrypts all
potentially sensitive data using your KMS key. Data is
encrypted in flight and at rest. For more information, see
[Encrypting Amazon RDS resources](overview-encryption.md).

5. Choose **Create database**.

AWS CLI

To turn on the Advanced mode of Database Insights when creating a DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster, call the [create-db-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html) or [create-db-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster.html) AWS CLI command and supply the following values:

- `--database-insights-mode advanced` to turn on the Advanced mode of Database Insights.

- `--engine` – The database engine for the DB instance.

- `--db-instance-identifier` – The identifier for the DB instance or `--db-cluster-identifier` – The identifier for the Multi-AZ DB cluster.

- `--enable-performance-insights` to turn on Performance Insights for Database Insights.

- `--performance-insights-retention-period` – The retention period for data for your DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster. To turn on Database Insights, the retention period must be at least 465 days.

The following example enables the Advanced mode of Database Insights when creating a DB instance.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance \
    --database-insights-mode advanced \
    --engine postgresql \
    --db-instance-identifier sample-db-identifier \
    --enable-performance-insights \
    --performance-insights-retention-period 465
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance ^
    --database-insights-mode advanced ^
    --engine postgresql ^
    --db-instance-identifier sample-db-identifier ^
    --enable-performance-insights ^
    --performance-insights-retention-period 465
```

RDS API

To turn on the Advanced mode of Database Insights when you create a DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster, specify the following parameters for your [CreateDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbinstance.md) or [CreateDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbcluster.md) Amazon RDS API operation.

- `DatabaseInsightsMode` to `advanced`

- `EnablePerformanceInsights` to `True`

- `PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod` to at least 465 days

## Turning on the Advanced mode of Database Insights when modifying a DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster

Turn on Database Insights when modifying a database for Amazon RDS. Modifying a DB instance to enable the Advanced mode of Database Insights doesn't cause downtime.

###### Note

To enable Database Insights, each DB instance in a Multi-AZ DB cluster must have the same Performance Insights and Enhanced Monitoring settings.

Console

In the console, you can turn on the Advanced mode of Database Insights when you
modify a DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster.

###### To turn on the Advanced mode of Database Insights when modifying a DB instance or Multi-AZDB cluster using the console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose **Databases**.

3. Choose a DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster, and choose **Modify**.

4. In the **Database Insights** section, select **Advanced mode**. Then, choose the following options:

- **Retention** – The amount of time to retain Performance Insights data. The retention period must be 15 months for the Advanced mode of Database Insights.

- **AWS KMS key** – Specify your
KMS key. Performance Insights encrypts all
potentially sensitive data using your KMS key. Data is
encrypted in flight and at rest. For more information, see
[Encrypting Amazon RDS resources](overview-encryption.md).

5. Choose **Continue**.

6. For **Scheduling of Modifications**, choose **Apply immediately**. If you
    choose **Apply during the next scheduled maintenance window**, your database
    ignores this setting and turns on the Advanced mode of Database Insights immediately.

7. Choose **Modify instance**.

AWS CLI

To turn on the Advanced mode of Database Insights when modifying a DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster, call the [modify-db-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html) or [modify-db-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster.html) AWS CLI command and supply the following values:

- `--database-insights-mode advanced` to turn on the Advanced mode of Database Insights.

- `--db-instance-identifier` – The identifier for the DB instance or `--db-cluster-identifier` – The identifier for the Multi-AZ DB cluster.

- `--enable-performance-insights` to turn on Performance Insights for Database Insights.

- `--performance-insights-retention-period` – The retention period for data for your DB instance. To turn on the Advanced mode of Database Insights, the retention period must be at least 465 days.

The following example enables the Advanced mode of Database Insights when modifying a DB instance.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --database-insights-mode advanced \
    --db-instance-identifier sample-db-identifier \
    --enable-performance-insights \
    --performance-insights-retention-period 465
```
