# Viewing pending database upgrades for RDS Custom DB instances

###### Note

End of support notice: On March 31, 2027, AWS will end support for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. After March 31, 2027, you will no longer be able to access the RDS Custom for Oracle console or RDS Custom for Oracle resources. For more information, see [RDS Custom for Oracle end of support](rds-custom-for-oracle-end-of-support.md).

You can see pending database upgrades for your Amazon RDS Custom DB instances by using the [describe-db-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.md) or
[describe-pending-maintenance-actions](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-pending-maintenance-actions.md) AWS CLI command.

However, this approach doesn't work if you used the `--apply-immediately`
option or if the upgrade is in progress.

The following `describe-db-instances` command shows pending database upgrades
for `my-custom-instance`.

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier my-custom-instance
```

The output resembles the following.

```

{
    "DBInstances": [
        {
           "DBInstanceIdentifier": "my-custom-instance",
            "EngineVersion": "19.my_cev1",
            ...
            "PendingModifiedValues": {
                "EngineVersion": "19.my_cev3"
            ...
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
