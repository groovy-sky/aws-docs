# Stopping automated backup replication for Amazon RDS

You can stop backup replication for DB instances using the Amazon RDS console. You can also use the
`stop-db-instance-automated-backups-replication` AWS CLI command or the
`StopDBInstanceAutomatedBackupsReplication` RDS API operation.

Replicated backups are retained, subject to the backup retention period set when they were created.

Stop backup replication from the **Automated backups** page
in the source Region.

###### To stop backup replication to an AWS Region

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose the source Region from the **Region selector**.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Automated backups**.

4. On the **Current Region** tab, choose the DB instance for which you want to stop backup
    replication.

5. For **Actions**, choose **Manage cross-Region replication**.

6. Under **Backup replication**, clear the **Enable replication to another AWS Region** check box.

7. Choose **Save**.

Replicated backups are listed on the **Retained** tab of the **Automated backups**
page in the destination Region.

Stop backup replication by using the [`stop-db-instance-automated-backups-replication`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/stop-db-instance-automated-backups-replication.html)
AWS CLI command.

The following CLI example stops automated backups of a DB instance from replicating in the US West (Oregon)
