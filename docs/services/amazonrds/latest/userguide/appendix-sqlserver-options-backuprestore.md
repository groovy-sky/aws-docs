# Support for native backup and restore in SQL Server

By using native backup and restore for SQL Server databases, you can create a
differential or full backup of your on-premises database
and store the backup files on Amazon S3. You can then restore to an existing Amazon RDS DB instance running SQL Server.
You can also back up an RDS for SQL Server database, store it on Amazon S3, and restore it in other locations. In addition, you can
restore the backup to an on-premises server, or a different Amazon RDS DB instance running
SQL Server. For more information, see [Importing and exporting SQL Server databases using native backup and restore](sqlserver-procedural-importing.md).

Amazon RDS supports native backup and restore for Microsoft SQL Server databases by using
differential and full backup files (.bak files).

## Adding the native backup and restore option

The general process for adding the native backup and restore option to a DB instance is the following:

1. Create a new option group, or copy or modify an existing option
    group.

2. Add the `SQLSERVER_BACKUP_RESTORE` option to the option group.

3. Associate an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with the option. The IAM role must have access to an S3 bucket to
    store the database backups.

That is, the option must have as its option setting a valid Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the format
    `arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/role-name`.
    For more information, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arn-syntax-iam) in the _AWS General Reference._

The IAM role must also have a trust relationship and a permissions policy attached. The trust relationship allows
    RDS to assume the role, and the permissions policy defines the actions that the role can perform. For more
    information, see [Manually creating an IAM role for native backup and restore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.Procedural.Importing.Native.Enabling.html#SQLServer.Procedural.Importing.Native.Enabling.IAM).

4. Associate the option group with the DB instance.

After you add the native backup and restore option, you don't need to restart your DB
instance. As soon as the option group is active, you can begin backing up and restoring immediately.

###### To add the native backup and restore option

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Option groups**.

3. Create a new option group or use an existing option group. For information on how to
    create a custom DB option group, see [Creating an option group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.html#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Create).

To use an existing option group, skip to the next step.

4. Add the **SQLSERVER\_BACKUP\_RESTORE** option to the option
    group. For more information about adding options, see [Adding an option to an option group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.html#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.AddOption).

5. Do one of the following:

- To use an existing IAM role and Amazon S3 settings, choose an existing IAM role for
**IAM Role**. If you use an existing IAM
role, RDS uses the Amazon S3 settings configured for this role.

- To create a new role and configure Amazon S3 settings, do the following:

1. For **IAM role**, choose **Create a new role**.

2. For **S3 bucket**, choose an S3 bucket from the list.

3. For **S3 prefix (optional)**, specify a prefix to use for the files stored in your Amazon S3 bucket.

This prefix can include a file path but doesn't have to. If you provide a prefix, RDS
    attaches that prefix to all backup files. RDS then uses the
    prefix during a restore to identify related files and ignore
    irrelevant files. For example, you might use the S3 bucket
    for purposes besides holding backup files. In this case, you
    can use the prefix to have RDS perform native backup and
    restore only on a particular folder and its subfolders.

If you leave the prefix blank, then RDS doesn't use a prefix to identify backup files
    or files to restore. As a result, during a multiple-file
    restore, RDS attempts to restore every file in every folder
    of the S3 bucket.

4. Choose the **Enable encryption** check box to encrypt the backup file. Leave the check box cleared (the
    default) to have the backup file unencrypted.

If you chose **Enable encryption**, choose an encryption key for **AWS KMS key**. For
    more information about encryption keys, see [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide._

6. Choose **Add option**.

7. Apply the option group to a new or existing DB instance:

- For a new DB instance, apply the option group when you launch the instance. For more
information, see [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md).

- For an existing DB instance, apply the option group by modifying the instance and
attaching the new option group. For more information, see
[Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

This procedure makes the following assumptions:

- You're adding the SQLSERVER\_BACKUP\_RESTORE option to an option group that already
exists. For more information about adding options, see [Adding an option to an option group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.html#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.AddOption).

- You're associating the option with an IAM role that already exists and has access to an
S3 bucket to store the backups.

- You're applying the option group to a DB instance that already exists. For more
information, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

###### To add the native backup and restore option

1. Add the `SQLSERVER_BACKUP_RESTORE` option to the option group.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds add-option-to-option-group \
   	--apply-immediately \
   	--option-group-name mybackupgroup \
   	--options "OptionName=SQLSERVER_BACKUP_RESTORE, \
   	  OptionSettings=[{Name=IAM_ROLE_ARN,Value=arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/role-name}]"
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds add-option-to-option-group ^
   	--option-group-name mybackupgroup ^
   	--options "[{\"OptionName\": \"SQLSERVER_BACKUP_RESTORE\", ^
   	\"OptionSettings\": [{\"Name\": \"IAM_ROLE_ARN\", ^
   	\"Value\": \"arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/role-name"}]}]" ^
   	--apply-immediately
```

###### Note

When using the Windows command prompt, you must escape double quotes (") in JSON code by
prefixing them with a backslash (\\).

2. Apply the option group to the DB instance.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
   	--db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
   	--option-group-name mybackupgroup \
   	--apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance ^
   	--db-instance-identifier mydbinstance ^
   	--option-group-name mybackupgroup ^
   	--apply-immediately
```

## Modifying native backup and restore option settings

After you enable the native backup and restore option, you can modify the settings for the
option. For more information about how to modify option settings, see [Modifying an option setting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.html#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.ModifyOption).

## Removing the native backup and restore option

You can turn off native backup and restore by removing the option from your DB instance.
After you remove the native backup and restore option, you don't need to restart
your DB instance.

To remove the native backup and restore option from a DB instance, do one of the following:

- Remove the option from the option group it belongs to. This change affects all DB
instances that use the option group. For more information, see [Removing an option from an option group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.html#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.RemoveOption).

- Modify the DB instance and specify a different option group that doesn't include the
native backup and restore option. This change affects a single DB instance.
You can specify the default (empty) option group, or a different custom
option group. For more information, see
[Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).
