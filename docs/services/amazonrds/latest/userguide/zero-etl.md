# Amazon RDS zero-ETL integrations

An Amazon RDS
zero-ETL integration with Amazon Redshift and Amazon SageMaker AI enables near real-time
analytics and machine learning (ML) using data from RDS. It's a fully managed solution
for making transactional data available in your analytics destination after it is written to
an RDS database. _Extract, transform,_ and _load_ (ETL) is the process of combining data from multiple
sources into a large, central data warehouse.

A zero-ETL integration makes the data in your RDS
database available in Amazon Redshift or an
Amazon SageMaker AI lakehouse in near real-time. Once that data is in the
target data warehouse or data lake, you can power your analytics, ML, and AI workloads using
the built-in capabilities, such as machine learning, materialized views, data sharing,
federated access to multiple data stores and data lakes, and integrations with Amazon SageMaker AI,
Quick, and other AWS services.

To create a zero-ETL integration, you specify an RDS
database as the
_source_, and a supported data warehouse or lakehouse as the
_target_. The integration replicates data from the source database into
the target data warehouse or lakehouse.

The following diagram illustrates this functionality for zero-ETL integration with Amazon Redshift:

The integration monitors the health of the data pipeline and recovers from issues when
possible. You can create integrations from multiple RDS
databases into a single target data
warehouse or lakehouse enabling you to derive insights across multiple applications.

## Benefits

RDS
zero-ETL integrations have the following benefits:

- Help you derive holistic insights from multiple data sources.

- Eliminate the need to build and maintain complex data pipelines that perform
extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations. Zero-ETL integrations remove the
challenges that come with building and managing pipelines by provisioning and
managing them for you.

- Reduce operational burden and cost, and let you focus on improving your
applications.

- Let you leverage the target destination's analytics and ML capabilities to
derive insights from transactional and other data, to respond effectively to
critical, time-sensitive events.

## Key concepts

As you get started with zero-ETL integrations, consider the following concepts:

**Integration**

A fully managed data pipeline that automatically replicates transactional
data and schemas from an RDS
database to a data
warehouse or catalog.

**Source database**

The RDS database where data is replicated from.
You can specify a
Single-AZ or Multi-AZ DB instance, or a Multi-AZ DB cluster (for RDS for MySQL
only).

**Target**

The data warehouse or lakehouse where the data is replicated to. There are
two types of data warehouse: a [provisioned\
cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html) data warehouse and a [serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/serverless-workgroup-namespace.html) data warehouse. A provisioned cluster data warehouse
is a collection of computing resources called nodes, which are organized
into a group called a _cluster_. A serverless data
warehouse is comprised of a workgroup that stores compute resources, and a
namespace that houses the database objects and users. Both data warehouses
run an analytics engine and contain one or more databases.

A target lakehouse consists of catalogs, databases, tables, and views. For
more information about lakehouse architecture, see [SageMaker Lakehouse components](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-unified-studio/latest/userguide/lakehouse-components.html) in the _Amazon SageMaker AI Unified Studio User_
_Guide_.

Multiple source databases can write to the same target.

For more information, see [Data warehouse\
system architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_high_level_system_architecture.html) in the _Amazon Redshift Developer_
_Guide_.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply to RDS zero-ETL integrations.

###### Topics

- [General limitations](#zero-etl.reqs-lims-general)

- [RDS for MySQL limitations](#zero-etl.reqs-lims-mysql)

- [RDS for PostgreSQL limitations](#zero-etl.reqs-lims-rds-postgres)

- [RDS for Oracle limitations](#zero-etl.reqs-lims-oracle)

- [Amazon Redshift limitations](#zero-etl.reqs-lims-redshift)

- [Amazon SageMaker AI lakehouse limitations](#zero-etl.reqs-lims-sagemaker-)

### General limitations

- The source database must be in the same
Region as the target.

- You can't rename a database if it has
existing integrations.

- You can't create multiple integrations between the same source and target
databases.

- You can't delete a database that has existing integrations. You must
delete all associated integrations first.

- If you stop the source database, the last
few transactions might not be replicated to the target until you resume the
database.

- You can’t delete an integration if the source database is stopped.

- If your database is the source of a blue/green
deployment, the blue and green environments can't have existing
zero-ETL integrations during switchover. You must delete the integration first and
switch over, then recreate it.

- You can't create an integration for a source database that has another
integration being actively created.

- When you initially create an integration, or when a table is being
resynchronized, data seeding from the source to the target can take 20-25
minutes or more depending on the size of the source database. This delay can
lead to increased replica lag.

- Some data types aren't supported. For more information, see [Data type differences between RDS and Amazon Redshift databases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/zero-etl.querying.html#zero-etl.data-type-mapping).

- System tables, temporary tables, and views aren't replicated to target
warehouses.

- Performing DDL commands (for example `ALTER TABLE`) on a source
table can trigger a table resynchronization, making the table unavailable
for querying while it's resynchronizing. For more information, see [One or more of my Amazon Redshift tables requires a resync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/zero-etl.troubleshooting.html#zero-etl.troubleshooting.resync).

### RDS for MySQL limitations

- Your source database must be running a supported version of RDS for MySQL.
For a list of supported versions, see [Supported Regions and DB engines for Amazon RDS zero-ETL integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RDS_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.ZeroETL.html).

- Zero-ETL integrations are not supported on both the primary instance and a read
replica instance in the same AWS Region.

- Zero-ETL integrations rely on MySQL binary logging (binlog) to capture ongoing
data changes. Don't use binlog-based data filtering, as it can cause data
inconsistencies between the source and target databases.

- Zero-ETL integrations are supported only for databases configured to use the
InnoDB storage engine.

- Foreign key references with predefined table updates aren't supported.
Specifically, `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` rules aren't
supported with `CASCADE`, `SET NULL`, and `SET
                              DEFAULT` actions. Attempting to create or update a table with such
references to another table will put the table into a failed state.

- You can't create an integration for a source database that uses magnetic storage.

### RDS for PostgreSQL limitations

- The source database must be an RDS for PostgreSQL instance running version
15.7+, 16.3+, or 17.1+. Earlier versions are not supported.

- RDS for PostgreSQL zero-ETL integrations don't support Multi-AZ DB clusters as source
databases.

- You can't create a zero-ETL integration from an RDS for PostgreSQL read replica
instance.

- PostgreSQL unlogged tables and materialized views are not replicated to
Amazon Redshift.

- Replication of certain PostgreSQL data types, such as [geometry data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-geometric.html) and data greater than 64KB, is not
supported due to limitations in Amazon Redshift. For more information about data type
differences between RDS for PostgreSQL and Amazon Redshift, see [RDS for PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/zero-etl.querying.html#zero-etl.data-type-mapping-postgres) in the **Data type differences** section.

- You can't perform a [major version upgrade](user-upgradedbinstance-postgresql.md) on the source RDS for PostgreSQL instance while
it has an active zero-ETL integration. To upgrade the source instance, you
must first delete all existing zero-ETL integrations. After the major
version upgrade is complete, you can recreate the zero-ETL
integrations.

- If you perform [declarative partitioning](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html) transactions on the source DB instance, all
affected tables enter a failed state and are no longer accessible.

### RDS for Oracle limitations

- The source database must be an RDS for Oracle instance running version 19c
Enterprise Edition or Standard Edition 2, July 2019 Release Update or later.
Earlier versions are not supported.

- You can't create a zero-ETL integration from an RDS for Oracle read replica
instance.

- You can't rename a [tenant\
database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Oracle.Concepts.CDBs.html) when there is a zero-ETL integration on that tenant
database.

- A tenant database can have only one zero-ETL integration.

- RDS for Oracle and Amazon Redshift have some data type differences. For more information,
see [RDS for Oracle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/zero-etl.querying.html#zero-etl.data-type-mapping-oracle) in the **Data type differences** section.

### Amazon Redshift limitations

For a list of Amazon Redshift limitations related to zero-ETL integrations, see [Considerations when using zero-ETL integrations with Amazon Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/zero-etl.reqs-lims.html) in
the _Amazon Redshift Management Guide_.

### Amazon SageMaker AI lakehouse limitations
