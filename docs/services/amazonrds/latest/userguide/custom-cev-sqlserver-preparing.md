# Preparing to create a CEV for RDS Custom for SQL Server

You can create a CEV using an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that contains pre-installed,
License Included (LI) Microsoft SQL Server, or with an AMI on which you install your own SQL
Server installation media (BYOM).

## Preparing a CEV

Use the following procedures to create a CEV using Bring Your Own Media (BYOM) or pre-installed Microsoft SQL Server (LI).

The following steps use an AMI with **Windows Server 2019 Base** as an example.

###### To create a CEV using BYOM

01. On the Amazon EC2 console, choose **Launch Instance**.

02. For **Name**, enter the name of the instance.

03. Under Quick Start, choose **Windows**.

04. Choose **Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Base**.

05. Choose an appropriate instance type, key pair, network and storage settings, and launch the instance.

06. After launching or creating the EC2 instance, ensure the correct Windows AMI was selected from Step 4:

    1. Select the EC2 instance in the Amazon EC2 console.

    2. In the **Details** section, check the **Usage operation** and ensure that it is set to **RunInstances:0002**.

       ![Windows AMI using RunInstances:0002 for BYOM.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/cev-sqlserver-byom-ec2runinstances.png)
07. Log in to the EC2 instance and copy your SQL Server installation media to it.

    ###### Note

    If you're building a CEV using SQL Server Developer edition, you may need to obtain the installation media using your [Microsoft Visual Studio subscription](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=sqlserver+developer).

08. Install SQL Server. Make sure that you do the following:

    1. Review [Requirements for BYOM for RDS Custom for SQL Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-sqlserver.byom.html#custom-sqlserver.byom.requirements) and [Version support for RDS Custom for SQL Server CEVs](#custom-cev-sqlserver.preparing.VersionSupport).

    2. Set the instance root directory to the default `C:\Program
                                       Files\Microsoft SQL Server\`. Don't change this
        directory.

    3. Set the SQL Server Database Engine Account Name to either `NT
                                       Service\MSSQLSERVER` or `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK
                                       SERVICE`.

    4. Set the SQL Server Startup mode to **Manual**.

    5. Choose SQL Server Authentication mode as
        **Mixed**.

    6. Leave the current settings for the default Data directories and TempDB
        locations.
09. Grant the SQL Server sysadmin (SA) server role privilege to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`:

    ```sql

    USE [master]
    GO
    EXEC master..sp_addsrvrolemember @loginame = N'NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM' , @rolename = N'sysadmin'
    GO

    ```

10. Install additional software or customize the OS and database configuration to meet your requirements.

11. Run Sysprep on the EC2 instance. For more information, see
     [Create an Amazon EC2 AMI using Windows Sysprep](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ami-create-win-sysprep.md).

12. Save the AMI that contains your installed SQL Server version, other software, and customizations. This will be your golden image.

13. Create a new CEV by providing the AMI ID of the image that you created. For detailed steps,
     see [Creating a CEV for RDS Custom for SQL Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-cev-sqlserver.create.html).

14. Create a new RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance using the CEV. For detailed steps, see [Create an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance from a CEV](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-cev-sqlserver.create.html#custom-cev-sqlserver.create.newdbinstance).

The following steps to create a CEV using pre-installed Microsoft SQL Server (LI) use
an AMI with **SQL Server CU20** Release number `2023.05.10`
as an example. When you create a CEV, choose an AMI with the most recent release number.
This ensures that you are using a supported version of Windows Server and SQL Server
with the latest Cumulative Update (CU).

###### To create a CEV using pre-installed Microsoft SQL Server (LI)

1. Choose the latest available AWS EC2 Windows Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with License Included
    (LI) Microsoft Windows Server and SQL Server.

1. Search for **CU20** within the [Windows AMI version history](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-windows-ami-version-history.html).

2. Note the Release number. For SQL Server 2019 CU20, the release number is
       `2023.05.10`.

      ![AMI version history result for SQL Server 2019 CU20.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/rds_custom_sqlserver_cev_find_ami_history_li_cu20.png)

3. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
       [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

4. In the left navigation panel of the Amazon EC2 console choose **Images**, then **AMIs**.

5. Choose **Public images**.

6. Enter `2023.05.10` into the search box. A list of AMIs
       appears.

7. Enter `Windows_Server-2019-English-Full-SQL_2019` into the search box to filter the results. The following
       results should appear.

8. Choose the AMI with the SQL Server edition that you want to use.
2. Create or launch an EC2 instance from your chosen AMI.

3. Log in to the EC2 instance and install additional software or customize the OS and database
    configuration to meet your requirements.

4. Run Sysprep on the EC2 instance. For more information prepping an AMI using Sysprep, see
    [Create a standardized Amazon Machine Image (AMI) using Sysprep](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/Creating_EBSbacked_WinAMI.html#sysprep-using-ec2launchv2).

5. Save the AMI that contains your installed SQL Server version, other software, and customizations.
    This will be your golden image.

6. Create a new CEV by providing the AMI ID of the image that you created. For detailed steps on creating a CEV,
    see [Creating a CEV for RDS Custom for SQL Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-cev-sqlserver.create.html).

7. Create a new RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance using the CEV. For detailed steps, see [Create an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance from a CEV](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-cev-sqlserver.create.html#custom-cev-sqlserver.create.newdbinstance).

## Requirements for RDS Custom for SQL Server CEVs

The following requirements apply to creating a CEV for RDS Custom for SQL Server:

- The AMI used to create a CEV must be based on an OS and database configuration
supported by RDS Custom for SQL Server. For more information on supported configurations, see
[Requirements and limitations for Amazon RDS Custom for SQL Server](custom-reqs-limits-ms.md).

- The CEV must have a unique name. You can't create a CEV with the same name
as an existing CEV.

- You must name the CEV using a naming pattern of SQL Server _major_
_version + minor version + customized string_. The _major_
_version + minor version_ must match the SQL Server version
provided with the AMI. For example, you can name an AMI with SQL Server 2019
CU17 as **15.00.4249.2.my\_cevtest**.

- You must prepare an AMI using Sysprep. For more information about prepping
an AMI using Sysprep, see [Create a standardized Amazon Machine Image (AMI) using\
Sysprep](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ami-create-win-sysprep.md).

- You are responsible for maintaining the life cycle of the AMI. An RDS Custom for SQL Server
DB instance created from a CEV doesn't store a copy of the AMI. It maintains a
pointer to the AMI that you used to create the CEV. The AMI must exist for an
RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance to remain operable.

## Limitations for RDS Custom for SQL Server CEVs

The following limitations apply to custom engine versions with RDS Custom for SQL Server:

- You can't delete a CEV if there are resources, such as DB instances or DB
snapshots, associated with it.

- To create an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance, a CEV must have a status of
`pending-validation`, `available`,
`failed`, or `validating`. You can't create an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance
using a CEV if the CEV status is `incompatible-image-configuration`.

- To modify a RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance to use a new CEV, the CEV must have a status of `available`.

- You can't create an AMI or CEV from an existing RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance.

- You can't modify an existing CEV to use a different AMI. However, you can
modify an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance to use a different CEV. For more information, see [Modifying an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-managing.modify-sqlserver.html).

- Encrypting an AMI or CEV with a customer-managed KMS key different than the
KMS key provided during DB instance creation is not supported.

- Cross-Region copy of CEVs isn't supported.

- Cross-account copy of CEVs isn't supported.

- You can't restore or recover a CEV after you delete it. However, you
can create a new CEV from the same AMI.

- A RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance stores your SQL Server database files in the _D:\_ drive. The AMI associated with a CEV
should store the Microsoft SQL Server system database files in the _C:\_ drive.

- An RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance retains your configuration changes made to SQL
Server. Any configuration changes to the OS on a running RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance
created from a CEV aren't retained. If you need to make a permanent
configuration change to the OS and have it retained as your new baseline
configuration, create a new CEV and modify the DB instance to use the new CEV.

###### Important

Modifying an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance to use a new CEV is an offline operation.
You can perform the modification immediately or schedule it to occur during a weekly maintenance window.

- When you modify a CEV, Amazon RDS doesn't push those modifications to any associated RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instances. You
must modify each RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance to use the new or updated CEV. For
more information, see [Modifying an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-managing.modify-sqlserver.html).

- ###### Important

If an AMI used by a CEV is deleted, any modifications that may require host replacement, for example,
scale compute, will fail. The RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance will then be placed outside of the RDS support perimeter.
We recommend that you avoid deleting any AMI that's associated to a CEV.
