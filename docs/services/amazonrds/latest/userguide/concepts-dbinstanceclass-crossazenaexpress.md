# Cross-Availability Zone ENA Express support for Multi-AZ deployments

Amazon RDS supports Cross-Availability Zone ENA Express for eligible DB instance classes in Multi-AZ
deployments using AWS's Scalable Reliable Datagram (SRD) protocol. Cross-Availability Zone
ENA Express increases single-flow network bandwidth enabling faster block-level data
replication between primary and standby DB instances.

For more details on SRD and for a list of instance classes that support Cross-Availability
Zone ENA Express, see [ENA Express](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ena-express.md) in
the Amazon EC2 documentation.

###### Note

Cross-Availability Zone ENA Express is not supported for Amazon RDS for SQL Server.

## Benefits

With Cross-Availability Zone ENA Express enabled, Multi-AZ deployments see an
increase in single-flow bandwidth for data replication between Availability Zones. With
advanced congestion control and multi-pathing capabilities, Cross-Availability Zone ENA
Express reduces replication latency and replication latency variability and improves
failover reliability for write-intensive workloads.

Actual throughput depends on the aggregate bandwidth limit of the DB instance class, the
database engine, and your database configuration.

## Enabling Cross-Availability Zone ENA Express

Cross-Availability Zone ENA Express is enabled by default on all newly created
Multi-AZ DB instances that use eligible instance classes.

To enable Cross-Availability Zone ENA Express on an existing Multi-AZ DB instance, do one of
the following:

- Stop and start the DB instance. For more information, see [Stopping an Amazon RDS DB instance temporarily](user-stopinstance.md).

- Modify the DB instance to use an eligible instance class. For more information, see
[Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

- Use Scale Compute on an eligible instance class. For more
information, see [Scale Compute](../gettingstartedguide/scaling-ha.md).
