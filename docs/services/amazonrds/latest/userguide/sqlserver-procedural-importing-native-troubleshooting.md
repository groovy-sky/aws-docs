# Troubleshooting

The following are issues you might encounter when you use native backup and restore.

IssueTroubleshooting suggestions

**`Database backup/restore option is not enabled yet or is in the process of being enabled. Please**
**try again later.`**

Make sure that you have added the `SQLSERVER_BACKUP_RESTORE` option to the DB option group
associated with your DB instance. For more information, see [Adding the native backup and restore option](appendix-sqlserver-options-backuprestore.md#Appendix.SQLServer.Options.BackupRestore.Add).

**`The EXECUTE permission was denied on the object**
**'rds_backup_database', database**
**'msdb', schema 'dbo'.`**

Make sure that you are using the master user when executing the
stored procedure. If you encounter this error even after being
logged in as the master user, it might be due to the admin user
permissions being misaligned. To reset the master user, use the AWS Management Console.
See [Resetting the db\_owner role membership for master user for Amazon RDS for SQL Server](appendix-sqlserver-commondbatasks-resetpassword.md).

See [Resetting the db\_owner role membership for master user for Amazon RDS for SQL Server](appendix-sqlserver-commondbatasks-resetpassword.md).

**`Access Denied`**

The backup or restore process can't access the backup file. This is usually caused by issues like the following:

- Referencing the incorrect bucket. Referencing the bucket using an incorrect format. Referencing a file name without using the ARN.

- Incorrect permissions on the bucket file. For example, if it is created by a different account that is trying to
access it now, add the correct permissions.

- An IAM policy that is incorrect or incomplete. Your IAM role must include all the necessary elements, including, for example, the correct
version. These are highlighted in [Importing and exporting SQL Server databases using native backup and restore](sqlserver-procedural-importing.md).

**`BACKUP DATABASE WITH COMPRESSION isn't supported on <edition_name> Edition`**

Compressing your backup files is only supported for Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Edition and Standard
Edition.

For more information, see [Compressing backup files](sqlserver-procedural-importing-native-compression.md).

**`Key <ARN> does not exist`**

You attempted to restore an encrypted backup, but didn't provide a valid encryption key. Check your encryption key and retry.

For more information, see [Restoring a database](sqlserver-procedural-importing-native-using.md#SQLServer.Procedural.Importing.Native.Using.Restore).

**`Please reissue task with correct type and overwrite property`**

If you attempt to back up your database and provide the name of a file that already exists, but set the overwrite property to false,
the save operation fails. To fix this error, either provide the name of a file that doesn't already exist, or set the overwrite property to true.

For more information, see [Backing up a database](sqlserver-procedural-importing-native-using.md#SQLServer.Procedural.Importing.Native.Using.Backup).

It's also possible that you intended to restore your database, but called the `rds_backup_database` stored
procedure accidentally. In that case, call the `rds_restore_database` stored procedure instead.

For more information, see [Restoring a database](sqlserver-procedural-importing-native-using.md#SQLServer.Procedural.Importing.Native.Using.Restore).

If you intended to restore your database and called the
`rds_restore_database` stored procedure, make sure that you provided the name of a valid backup file.

For more information, see [Using native backup and restore](sqlserver-procedural-importing-native-using.md).

**`Please specify a bucket that is in the same region as RDS instance`**

You can't back up to, or restore from, an Amazon S3 bucket in a different AWS Region from your Amazon RDS DB instance. You can use Amazon S3 replication to copy the backup
file to the correct AWS Region.

For more information, see [Cross-Region replication](../../../s3/latest/userguide/crr.md) in the Amazon S3 documentation.

**`The specified bucket does not exist`**

Verify that you have provided the correct ARN for your bucket and file, in the correct format.

For more information, see
[Using native backup and restore](sqlserver-procedural-importing-native-using.md).

**`User <ARN> is not authorized to perform <kms action> on resource <ARN>`**

You requested an encrypted operation, but didn't provide correct AWS KMS permissions. Verify that you have the correct permissions,
or add them.

For more information, see [Setting up for native backup and restore](sqlserver-procedural-importing-native-enabling.md).

**`The Restore task is unable to restore from more than 10 backup file(s). Please reduce the**
**number of files matched and try again.`**

Reduce the number of files that you're trying to restore from. You
can make each individual file larger if necessary.

**`Database 'database_name' already exists. Two databases that differ**
**only by case or accent are not allowed. Choose a different database name.`**

You can't restore a database with the same name as an existing database. Database names are
unique.
