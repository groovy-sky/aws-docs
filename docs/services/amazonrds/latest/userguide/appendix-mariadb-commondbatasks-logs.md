# Managing table-based MariaDB logs

You can direct the general and slow query logs to tables on the DB instance. To do so,
create a DB parameter group and set the `log_output` server parameter to
`TABLE`. General queries are then logged to the
`mysql.general_log` table, and slow queries are logged to the
`mysql.slow_log` table. You can query the tables to access the log
information. Enabling this logging increases the amount of data written to the database,
which can degrade performance.

Both the general log and the slow query logs are disabled by default. To enable logging to
tables, you must also set the following server parameters to `1`:

- `general_log`

- `slow_query_log` or `log_slow_query`

Log tables keep growing until the respective logging activities are turned off by
resetting the appropriate parameter to `0`. A large amount of data often
accumulates over time, which can use up a considerable percentage of your allocated
storage space. Amazon RDS doesn't allow you to truncate the log tables, but you can
move their contents. Rotating a table saves its contents to a backup table and then
creates a new empty log table. You can manually rotate the log tables with the
following command line procedures, where the command prompt is indicated by
`PROMPT>`:

```sql

PROMPT> CALL mysql.rds_rotate_slow_log;
PROMPT> CALL mysql.rds_rotate_general_log;
```

To completely remove the old data and reclaim the disk space, call the appropriate procedure twice in succession.
