# Restoring a DB instance to a specified time for Amazon RDS

You can restore a DB instance to a specific point in time, creating a new DB instance without modifying the source DB instance.

When you restore a DB instance to a point in time, you can choose the default virtual
private cloud (VPC) security group. Or you can apply a custom VPC security group to your DB instance.

Restored DB instances are automatically associated with the default DB parameter and option groups. However,
you can apply a custom parameter group and option group by specifying them during a restore.

If tags are provided in the request then the provided tags are applied to the restored DB instance. If tags are not
provided in the request and if the source DB instance is in-region active and has tags, RDS adds the latest tags from the source DB instance to the restored DB instance.

RDS uploads transaction logs for DB instances to Amazon S3 every five
minutes. To see the latest restorable time for a DB instance, use the AWS CLI [describe-db-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.md) command
and look at the value returned in the `LatestRestorableTime` field for the DB instance. To see the latest restorable time for each DB instance in the Amazon RDS console,
choose **Automated backups**.

You can restore to any point in time within your backup retention
period. To see the earliest restorable time for each DB instance, choose **Automated backups** in the Amazon RDS console.

###### Note

We recommend that you restore to the same or similar DB instance size—and IOPS if
using Provisioned IOPS storage—as the source DB instance. You might get an error
if, for example, you choose a DB instance size with an incompatible IOPS value.

For information about restoring a DB instance with an RDS Extended Support version, see [Restoring a DB instance or a Multi-AZ DB cluster with Amazon RDS Extended Support](extended-support-restoring-db-instance.md).

Some Amazon RDS database engines have special considerations when restoring
from a point in time:

- If
you use password authentication with an Amazon RDS for Db2 DB instance, user management
actions, including `rdsadmin.add_user`, won't be captured in the logs.
These actions require a full snapshot backup.

With the BYOL model, your RDS for Db2 DB instances must be associated with a custom
parameter group that contains your IBM Site ID and your IBM Customer ID. Otherwise, attempts
to restore a DB instance to a specific point in time will fail. Your Amazon RDS for Db2 DB
instances must also be associated with an AWS License Manager self-managed license. For more
information, see [Bring your own license (BYOL) for Db2](db2-licensing.md#db2-licensing-options-byol).

With the Db2 license through AWS Marketplace model, you need an active AWS Marketplace subscription
for the particular IBM Db2 edition that you want to use. If you don't already have
one, [subscribe to Db2 in\
AWS Marketplace](db2-licensing.md#db2-marketplace-subscribing-registering) for that IBM Db2 edition. For more information, see [Db2 license through AWS Marketplace](db2-licensing.md#db2-licensing-options-marketplace).

- When you restore an RDS for Oracle DB instance to a point in time, you can specify a different
DB engine, license model, and DBName (SID) for the restored DB instance. You can also
specify that RDS should store manage master user passwords in AWS Secrets Manager. For more
information, see [Overview of managing master user passwords with AWS Secrets Manager](rds-secrets-manager.md#rds-secrets-manager-overview).

- When you restore a Microsoft SQL Server DB instance to a point in time, each
database within that instance is restored to a point in time within 1 second of each
other database within the instance. Transactions that span multiple databases within
the instance might be restored inconsistently.

- For a SQL Server DB instance, the `OFFLINE`, `EMERGENCY`, and `SINGLE_USER` modes aren't supported.
Setting any database into one of these modes causes the latest restorable time to stop moving ahead for the whole instance.

- Some actions, such as changing the recovery model of a SQL Server database, can break the sequence of logs that are used
for point-in-time recovery. In some cases, Amazon RDS can detect this issue and the latest restorable time is prevented from
moving forward. In other cases, such as when a SQL Server database uses the `BULK_LOGGED` recovery model, the
break in log sequence isn't detected. It might not be possible to restore a SQL Server DB instance to a point in time
if there is a break in the log sequence. For these reasons, Amazon RDS doesn't support changing the recovery model of SQL
Server databases.

You can also use AWS Backup to manage backups of Amazon RDS DB instances. If your DB instance is associated with a backup plan in AWS Backup,
that backup plan is used for point-in-time recovery. Backups that were created with AWS Backup have names ending in
`awsbackup:AWS-Backup-job-number`. For information about AWS Backup, see the [_AWS Backup Developer Guide_](../../../aws-backup/latest/devguide.md).

###### Note

Information in this topic applies to Amazon RDS. For information on restoring an Amazon Aurora
DB cluster, see [Restoring a DB cluster to a\
specified time](../aurorauserguide/aurora-pitr.md).

You can restore a DB instance to a point in time using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS
API.

###### Note

You can't reduce the amount of storage when you restore a DB instance. When you increase the allocated storage, it must
be by at least 10 percent. If you try to increase the value by less than 10 percent, you get an error. You can't increase the
allocated storage when restoring RDS for SQL Server DB instances.

###### To restore a DB instance to a specified time

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Automated**
**backups**.

The automated backups are displayed on the **Current Region** tab.

3. Choose the DB instance that you want to restore.

4. For **Actions**, choose **Restore to point in time**.

The **Restore to point in time** window appears.

5. Choose **Latest restorable time** to restore to the latest possible time, or choose
    **Custom** to choose a time.

If you chose **Custom**, enter the date and time to which you want to restore the instance.

###### Note

Times are shown in your local time zone, which is indicated by an offset from Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC). For example, UTC-5 is Eastern Standard Time/Central Daylight Time.

6. For **DB instance identifier**, enter the name of the target restored DB instance. The name must be unique.

7. Choose other options as needed, such as DB instance class, storage, and whether you
    want to use storage autoscaling.

For information about each setting, see [Settings for DB instances](user-createdbinstance-settings.md).

8. Choose **Restore to point in time**.

To restore a DB instance to a specified time, use the AWS CLI command
[restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time.md)
to create a new DB instance. This example also sets the allocated storage size and enables storage autoscaling.

Resource tagging is supported for this operation. When you use the `--tags` option, the source DB instance tags
are ignored and the provided ones are used. Otherwise, the latest tags from the source instance are used.

You can specify other settings. For information about each setting, see
[Settings for DB instances](user-createdbinstance-settings.md).

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time \
    --source-db-instance-identifier mysourcedbinstance \
    --target-db-instance-identifier mytargetdbinstance \
    --restore-time 2017-10-14T23:45:00.000Z \
    --allocated-storage 100 \
    --max-allocated-storage 1000
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time ^
    --source-db-instance-identifier mysourcedbinstance ^
    --target-db-instance-identifier mytargetdbinstance ^
    --restore-time 2017-10-14T23:45:00.000Z ^
    --allocated-storage 100 ^
    --max-allocated-storage 1000
```

###### Example

The following example shows adding a volume when restoring the instance to a point in time.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time \
     --source-db-instance-identifier my-asv-instance \
     --target-db-instance-identifier my-pitr-instance \
     --use-latest-restorable-time \
     --additional-storage-volumes '[{ \
             "VolumeName": "rdsdbdata2", \
             "StorageType":"gp3", \
             "AllocatedStorage": 5000, \
             "IOPS": 12000 \
         }]'
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time ^
     --source-db-instance-identifier my-asv-instance ^
     --target-db-instance-identifier my-pitr-instance ^
     --use-latest-restorable-time ^
     --additional-storage-volumes '[{ ^
             "VolumeName": "rdsdbdata2", ^
             "StorageType":"gp3", ^
             "AllocatedStorage": 5000, ^
             "IOPS": 12000 ^
         }]'
```

To restore a DB instance to a specified time, call the Amazon RDS API
[`RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime`](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-restoredbinstancetopointintime.md) operation with the following parameters:

- `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`

- `TargetDBInstanceIdentifier`

- `RestoreTime`
