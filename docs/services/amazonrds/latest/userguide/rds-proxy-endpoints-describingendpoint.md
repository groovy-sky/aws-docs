# Viewing proxy endpoints

To view existing proxy endpoints, follow these instructions:

###### To view the details for a proxy endpoint

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Proxies**.

3. In the list, choose the proxy whose endpoint you want to view. Click the proxy name to view its
    details page.

4. In the **Proxy endpoints** section, choose the endpoint that you want to view. Click
    its name to view the details page.

5. Examine the parameters whose values you're interested in. You can check properties such as the
    following:

- Whether the endpoint is read/write or
read-only.

- The endpoint address that you use in a database connection
string.

- The VPC, subnets, and security groups associated with the
endpoint.

To view one or more proxy endpoints, use the AWS CLI [describe-db-proxy-endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-proxy-endpoints.html)
command.

You can include the following optional parameters:

- `--db-proxy-endpoint-name`

- `--db-proxy-name`

The following example describes the `my-endpoint` proxy endpoint.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-proxy-endpoints \
  --db-proxy-endpoint-name my-endpoint

```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-proxy-endpoints ^
  --db-proxy-endpoint-name my-endpoint

```

To describe one or more proxy endpoints, use the RDS API
[DescribeDBProxyEndpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBProxyEndpoints.html) operation.
