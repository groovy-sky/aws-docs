# Upgrading an Oracle DB snapshot

Upgrading your Oracle DB snapshots in Amazon RDS ensures that your database remains secure,
compatible, and fully supported. As older Oracle versions reach the end of patch support,
you can upgrade any manual DB snapshots tied to these versions to avoid potential
vulnerabilities or service limitations. For more information, see [Oracle engine version management](user-upgradedbinstance-oracle-overview.md#Oracle.Concepts.Patching).

Amazon RDS supports upgrading snapshots in all AWS Regions.

###### To upgrade an Oracle DB snapshot

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Snapshots**, and
    then select the DB snapshot that you want to upgrade.

3. For **Actions**, choose **Upgrade**
**snapshot**. The **Upgrade snapshot** page
    appears.

4. Choose the **New engine version** to upgrade the
    snapshot to.

5. (Optional) For **Option group**, choose the option
    group for the upgraded DB snapshot. The same option group considerations
    apply when upgrading a DB snapshot as when upgrading a DB instance. For
    more information, see [Option group considerations](user-upgradedbinstance-oracle-ogpg.md#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Oracle.OGPG.OG).

6. Choose **Save changes** to save your changes.

During the upgrade process, all snapshot actions are disabled for this
    DB snapshot. Also, the DB snapshot status changes from
    **available** to **upgrading**,
    and then changes to **active** upon completion. If the
    DB snapshot can't be upgraded because of snapshot corruption issues, the
    status changes to **unavailable**. You can't recover
    the snapshot from this state.

###### Note

If the DB snapshot upgrade fails, the snapshot is rolled back to
the original state with the original version.

To upgrade an Oracle DB snapshot by using the AWS CLI, call the [modify-db-snapshot](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-snapshot.md)
command with the following parameters:

- `--db-snapshot-identifier` – The name of the DB
snapshot.

- `--engine-version` – The version to upgrade the
snapshot to.

You might also need to include the following parameter. The same option group
considerations apply when upgrading a DB snapshot as when upgrading a DB
instance. For more information, see [Option group considerations](user-upgradedbinstance-oracle-ogpg.md#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Oracle.OGPG.OG).

- `--option-group-name` – The option group for the
upgraded DB snapshot.

###### Example

The following example upgrades a DB snapshot.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-snapshot \
    --db-snapshot-identifier mydbsnapshot \
    --engine-version 19.0.0.0.ru-2020-10.rur-2020-10.r1 \
    --option-group-name default:oracle-se2-19
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-snapshot ^
    --db-snapshot-identifier mydbsnapshot ^
    --engine-version 19.0.0.0.ru-2020-10.rur-2020-10.r1 ^
    --option-group-name default:oracle-se2-19
```

To upgrade an Oracle DB snapshot by using the Amazon RDS API, call the [ModifyDBSnapshot](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbsnapshot.md)
operation with the following parameters:

- `DBSnapshotIdentifier` – The name of the DB
snapshot.

- `EngineVersion` – The version to upgrade the
snapshot to.

You might also need to include the `OptionGroupName` parameter. The
same option group considerations apply when upgrading a DB snapshot as when
upgrading a DB instance. For more information, see [Option group considerations](user-upgradedbinstance-oracle-ogpg.md#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Oracle.OGPG.OG).
