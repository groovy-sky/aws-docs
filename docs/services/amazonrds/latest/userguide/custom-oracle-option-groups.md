# Working with option groups in RDS Custom for Oracle

###### Note

End of support notice: On March 31, 2027, AWS will end support for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. After March 31, 2027, you will no longer be able to access the RDS Custom for Oracle console or RDS Custom for Oracle resources. For more information, see [RDS Custom for Oracle end of support](rds-custom-for-oracle-end-of-support.md).

RDS Custom uses option groups to enable and configure additional features. An
_option group_ specifies features, called options, that are available
for an RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance. Options can have settings that specify how the option works. When
you associate an RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance with an option group, the specified options and option
settings are enabled for this instance. For general information about option groups in
Amazon RDS, see [Working with option groups](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md).

## Overview of option groups in RDS Custom for Oracle

To enable options for your Oracle database, add them to an option group, and then
associate the option group with your DB instance. For more information, see [Working with option groups](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md).

### Summary of RDS Custom for Oracle options

RDS Custom for Oracle supports the following options for a DB instance.

OptionOption IDDescription

Oracle time zone

`Timezone`

The time zone used by your RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance.

### Basic steps for adding an option to an RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance

The general procedure for adding an option to your RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance is the
following:

1. Create a new option group, or copy or modify an existing option
    group.

2. Add the option to the option group.

3. Associate the option group with your DB instance when you create or modify
    it.

### Creating an option group for in RDS Custom for Oracle

You can create a new option group that derives its settings from the default
option group. You then add one or more options to the new option group. Or, if you
already have an existing option group, you can copy that option group with all of
its options to a new option group. To learn how to copy an option group, see [Copying an option group](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Copy).

The default option groups for RDS Custom for Oracle are the following:

- `default:custom-oracle-ee`

- `default:custom-oracle-se2`

- `default:custom-oracle-ee-cdb`

- `default:custom-oracle-se2-cdb`

When you create an option group, the settings are derived from the default option
group. After you have added the `TIME_ZONE` option, you can then
associate the option group with your DB instance.

One way of creating an option group is by using the AWS Management Console.

###### To create a new option group by using the console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Option**
**groups**.

3. Choose **Create group**.

4. In the **Create option group** window, do the
    following:
1. For **Name**, type a name for the option
       group that is unique within your AWS account. The name can
       contain only letters, digits, and hyphens.

2. For **Description**, type a brief
       description of the option group. The description is used for
       display purposes.

3. For **Engine**, choose any of the
       following RDS Custom for Oracle DB engines:

- **custom-oracle-ee**

- **custom-oracle-se2**

- **custom-oracle-ee-cdb**

- **custom-oracle-se2-cdb**

4. For **Major engine version**, choose a
       major engine version supported by RDS Custom for Oracle. For more
       information, see [Supported Regions and DB engines for RDS Custom for Oracle](concepts-rds-fea-regions-db-eng-feature-rdscustom.md#Concepts.RDS_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.RDSCustom.ora).
5. To continue, choose **Create**. To cancel the
    operation instead, choose **Cancel**.

To create an option group, use the AWS CLI [`create-option-group`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-option-group.html) command with the following
required parameters.

- `--option-group-name`

- `--engine-name`

- `--major-engine-version`

- `--option-group-description`

###### Example

The following example creates an option group named
`testoptiongroup`, which is associated with the Oracle
Enterprise Edition DB engine. The description is enclosed in quotation
marks.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-option-group \
    --option-group-name testoptiongroup \
    --engine-name custom-oracle-ee-cdb \
    --major-engine-version 19 \
    --option-group-description "Test option group for a Custom Oracle CDB"
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-option-group ^
    --option-group-name testoptiongroup ^
    --engine-name custom-oracle-ee-cdb ^
    --major-engine-version 19 ^
    --option-group-description "Test option group for a Custom Oracle CDB"
```

To create an option group, call the Amazon RDS API [`CreateOptionGroup`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateOptionGroup.html) operation.

### Associating an option group with an RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance

You can associate your option group with a new or existing DB instance:

- For a new DB instance, apply the option group when you create the instance. For
more information, see [Creating an RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance](custom-creating.md#custom-creating.create).

- For an existing DB instance, apply the option group by modifying the instance
and attaching the new option group. For more information, see [Modifying your RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance](custom-managing-modifying.md).
