# Using AWS services to migrate data from Db2 to Amazon RDS for Db2

In Amazon RDS, there are several ways you can migrate data from a Db2 database to Amazon RDS for Db2.
You can perform a one-time migration of your Db2 database from Linux,
AIX, or Windows environments to Amazon RDS for Db2. To minimize
downtime, you can perform a near-zero downtime migration. You can migrate your data by saving
it to Amazon S3 and loading it one table at a time into your Db2 database. You can also perform a synchronous
migration through replication or use AWS Database Migration Service.

For one-time migrations for Linux-based Db2 databases, Amazon RDS only supports
offline and online backups. Amazon RDS doesn't support incremental and Delta
backups. For near-zero downtime migrations for Linux-based Db2 databases,
Amazon RDS requires online backups. We recommend that you use online backups for near-zero
downtime migrations and offline backups for migrations that can handle downtime.
