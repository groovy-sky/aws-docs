## Oracle APEX and ORDS prerequisites

Note the following prerequisites for using Oracle APEX and ORDS:

- Your system must use the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

- Your Oracle client installation must include the following:

- SQL\*Plus or SQL Developer for administration tasks

- Oracle Net Services for configuring connections to your RDS for Oracle
DB instance

## Oracle APEX limitations

You can't modify the `APEX_version` user
account, which is managed by Amazon RDS. Thus, you can't apply database profiles or
enforce password rules on this user. The profiles and password settings for
`APEX_version` are predefined by
Oracle and AWS and are designed to meet the security requirements for
Amazon RDS.
