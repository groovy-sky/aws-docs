# Sharing encrypted snapshots for Amazon RDS

You can share DB snapshots that have been encrypted "at rest" using the AES-256 encryption algorithm, as described in
[Encrypting Amazon RDS resources](overview-encryption.md).

The following restrictions apply to sharing encrypted snapshots:

- You can't share encrypted snapshots as public.

- You can't share Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server snapshots that are encrypted using Transparent Data Encryption
(TDE).

- You can't share a snapshot that has been encrypted using the default KMS key of the AWS account that shared the snapshot.

For more information about AWS KMS key management for Amazon RDS, see [AWS KMS key management](overview-encryption-keys.md).

To work around the default KMS key issue, perform the following tasks:

1. [Create a customer managed key and give access to it](#share-encrypted-snapshot.cmk).

2. [Copy and share the snapshot from the source account](#share-encrypted-snapshot.share).

3. [Copy the shared snapshot in the target account](#share-encrypted-snapshot.target).

## Create a customer managed key and give access to it

First you create a custom KMS key in the same AWS Region as the encrypted DB snapshot. While creating the
customer managed key, you give access to it for another AWS account.

###### Note

You can also use a KMS key from another AWS account when the key policy grants access to the source and target accounts.

###### To create a customer managed key and give access to it

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console from the source AWS account.

02. Open the AWS KMS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms).

03. To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.

04. In the navigation pane, choose **Customer managed keys**.

05. Choose **Create key**.

06. On the **Configure key** page:
    1. For **Key type**, select **Symmetric**.

    2. For **Key usage**, select **Encrypt and decrypt**.

    3. Expand **Advanced options**.

    4. For **Key material origin**, select **KMS**.

    5. For **Regionality**, select **Single-Region key**.

    6. Choose **Next**.
07. On the **Add labels** page:
    1. For **Alias**. enter a display name for your KMS key, for example
        `share-snapshot`.

    2. (Optional) Enter a description for your KMS key.

    3. (Optional) Add tags to your KMS key.

    4. Choose **Next**.
08. On the **Define key administrative permissions** page, choose **Next.**

09. On the **Define key usage permissions** page:
    1. For **Other AWS accounts**, choose **Add another**
       **AWS account**.

    2. Enter the ID of the AWS account to which you want to give access.

       You can give access to multiple AWS accounts.

    3. Choose **Next**.
10. Review your KMS key, then choose **Finish**.

## Copy and share the snapshot from the source account

Next you copy the source DB snapshot to a new snapshot using the customer managed key. Then you share it with the target
AWS account.

###### To copy and share the snapshot

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console from the source AWS account.

2. Open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds)

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Snapshots**.

4. Select the DB snapshot you want to copy.

5. For **Actions**, choose **Copy snapshot**.

6. On the **Copy snapshot** page:
1. For **Destination Region**, choose the AWS Region where you created the customer managed key in
       the previous procedure.

2. Enter the name of the DB snapshot copy in **New DB Snapshot Identifier**.

3. For **AWS KMS key**, choose the customer managed key that you created.

      ![Choose the customer managed key.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/copy-encrypted-snapshot.png)

4. Choose **Copy snapshot**.
7. When the snapshot copy is available, select it.

8. For **Actions**, choose **Share snapshot**.

9. On the **Snapshot permissions** page:

1. Enter the **AWS account ID** with which you're sharing the snapshot copy, then choose
       **Add**.

2. Choose **Save**.

The snapshot is shared.

## Copy the shared snapshot in the target account

Now you can copy the shared snapshot in the target AWS account.

###### To copy the shared snapshot

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console from the target AWS account.

2. Open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds)

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Snapshots**.

4. Choose the **Shared with me** tab.

5. Select the shared snapshot.

6. For **Actions**, choose **Copy snapshot**.

7. Choose your settings for copying the snapshot as in the previous procedure, but use an AWS KMS key that belongs
    to the target account.

Choose **Copy snapshot**.
