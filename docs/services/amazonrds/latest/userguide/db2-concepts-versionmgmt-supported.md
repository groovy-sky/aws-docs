# Upgrade management for Amazon RDS Db2 instances

To see the current list of supported Db2 minor versions on RDS, use one of the following commands:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --engine db2-se
aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --engine db2-ae
```

Amazon RDS also supports upgrade rollout policy to manage automatic minor version upgrades across multiple database resources and AWS accounts. For more information,
see [Using AWS Organizations upgrade rollout policy for automatic minor version upgrades](rds-maintenance-amvu-upgraderollout.md).

You can specify any currently supported Db2 version when creating a new DB instance.
You can specify the major version (such as Db2 11.5) and any supported minor version for
the specified major version. If no version is specified, Amazon RDS defaults to a supported
version, typically the most recent version. If a major version is specified but a minor
version is not, Amazon RDS defaults to a recent release of the major version that you have
specified. To see a list of supported versions, as well as defaults for newly created DB
instances, use the [describe-db-engine-versions](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-engine-versions.md) AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) command.

For example, to list the supported engine versions for Amazon RDS for Db2, run the following
AWS CLI command. Replace `region` with your AWS Region.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-engine-versions \
    --filters Name=engine,Values=db2-ae,db2-se \
    --query "DBEngineVersions[].{Engine:Engine, EngineVersion:EngineVersion, DBParameterGroupFamily:DBParameterGroupFamily}" \
    --region region
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-engine-versions ^
    --filters Name=engine,Values=db2-ae,db2-se ^
    --query "DBEngineVersions[].{Engine:Engine, EngineVersion:EngineVersion, DBParameterGroupFamily:DBParameterGroupFamily}" ^
    --region region
```

This command produces output similar to the following example:

```nohighlight

[
    {
    "Engine": "db2-ae",
    "EngineVersion": "11.5.9.0.sb00000000.r1",
    "DBParameterGroupFamily": "db2-ae-11.5"
    },
    {
    "Engine": "db2-se",
    "EngineVersion": "11.5.9.0.sb00000000.r1",
    "DBParameterGroupFamily": "db2-se-11.5"
    }
]
```

The default Db2 version might vary by AWS Region. To create a DB instance with a
specific minor version, specify the minor version during DB instance creation. You can
determine the default version for an AWS Region for `db2-ae` and
`db2-se` database engines by running the `
                describe-db-engine-versions` command. The following example returns the
default version for `db2-ae` in US East (N. Virginia).

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-engine-versions \
    --default-only --engine db2-ae \
    --query "DBEngineVersions[].{Engine:Engine, EngineVersion:EngineVersion, DBParameterGroupFamily:DBParameterGroupFamily}" \
    --region us-east-1
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-engine-versions ^
    --default-only --engine db2-ae ^
    --query "DBEngineVersions[].{Engine:Engine, EngineVersion:EngineVersion, DBParameterGroupFamily:DBParameterGroupFamily}" ^
    --region us-east-1
```

This command produces output similar to the following example:

```nohighlight

[
    {
    "Engine": "db2-ae",
    "EngineVersion": "11.5.9.0.sb00000000.r1",
    "DBParameterGroupFamily": "db2-ae-11.5"
    }
]
```

With Amazon RDS, you control when to upgrade your Db2 instance to a new major version
supported by Amazon RDS. You can maintain compatibility with specific Db2 versions, test new
versions with your application before deploying in production, and perform major version
upgrades at times that best fit your schedule.

When automatic minor version upgrade is enabled, Amazon RDS automatically upgrades your DB
instances to new Db2 minor versions as they are supported by Amazon RDS. This patching occurs
during your scheduled maintenance window. You can modify a DB instance to enable or
disable automatic minor version upgrades.

Except for Db2 versions 11.5.9.1 and 11.5.10.0, automatic upgrades to new Db2 minor
version includes automatic upgrades to new builds and revisions. For 11.5.9.1 and
11.5.10.0, manually upgrade minor versions.

If you opt out of automatically scheduled upgrades, you can manually upgrade to a
supported minor version release by following the same procedure as you would for a major
version update. For information, see [Upgrading a DB instance engine version](user-upgradedbinstance-upgrading.md).
