# Using RDS Proxy with Blue/Green Deployments

Amazon RDS Proxy can be used with Blue/Green Deployments to reduce switchover downtime. RDS Proxy
eliminates DNS propagation delays that typically occur during database transitions by
maintaining awareness of the switchover process and automatically redirecting connections to
the Green environment once it becomes the active production environment. RDS Proxy supports Blue/Green Deployments for RDS for PostgreSQL, RDS for MySQL and RDS for MariaDB. No
application code changes or custom client drivers are required.

## Switchover when using RDS Proxy

When your blue instance is attached to RDS Proxy, the following process occurs
during switchover:

- Switchover Guardrails

- Amazon RDS runs additional guardrail checks to validate that the proxy can
successfully reach both blue and green environments and is ready for
switchover.

- Application Traffic Routing During Switchover

For the list of switchover actions, see [Switchover actions](../aurorauserguide/blue-green-deployments-switching.md#blue-green-deployments-switching-actions). When the switchover happens through RDS Proxy, note the following considerations:

- During switchover, the Blue database enters read-only mode before Green
environment is promoted. RDS Proxy continues routing connections to the blue database
during this transitional period.

- Write operations on RDS for MySQL during this period may return read-only
errors. For example `1290 (HY000): The MySQL server is running with the
                  —read-only option` so it cannot execute this statement. On RDS for PostgreSQL read and write queries will return
AdminShutdown terminating connection due to administrator
command.

- Once the switchover is detected, the proxy automatically routes traffic to the
newly promoted green environment.

- When the Green environment is promoted as the new writer, existing connections to
the proxy are dropped. Applications must re-establish connections after the promotion
is complete.

- You can review CloudWatch logs for RDS Proxy to see when this transitional behavior
occurred.

- RDS Proxy API Behavior

- Proxy APIs such as `describe-db-proxy-targets` reflect the updated
targets only after the switchover is fully complete, even though traffic routing
occurs earlier.

## Limitations

- Your blue instance must already be a target of the proxy before you
create the blue/green deployment. You cannot add a blue instance to an RDS Proxy after a
blue/green deployment has been created for that instance.
