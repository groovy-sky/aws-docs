# Limitations of Multi-AZ DB clusters for Amazon RDS

A Multi-AZ DB cluster has a writer DB instance and two reader DB instances in three separate Availability Zones.
Multi-AZ DB clusters provide high availability, increased capacity for read workloads, and lower latency
when compared to Multi-AZ deployments. For more information about Multi-AZ DB clusters, see [Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments for Amazon RDS](multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.md).

The following limitations apply to Multi-AZ DB clusters.

- Multi-AZ DB clusters don't support the following features:

- IPv6 connections (dual-stack mode)

- Cross-Region automated backups

- Kerberos authentication

- Modifying the port. As an alternative, you can restore a Multi-AZ DB cluster to a point in time and
specify a different port.

- Option groups

- Point-in-time-recovery (PITR) for deleted clusters

- Storage autoscaling by setting the maximum allocated storage. As an alternative, you can
scale storage manually.

- Stopping and starting the Multi-AZ DB cluster

- Copying a snapshot of a Multi-AZ DB cluster

- Encrypting an unencrypted Multi-AZ DB cluster

- RDS for MySQL Multi-AZ DB clusters support only the following system stored procedures:

- `mysql.rds_rotate_general_log`

- `mysql.rds_rotate_slow_log`

- `mysql.rds_show_configuration`

- `mysql.rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position`

- `mysql.rds_set_configuration`

- RDS for PostgreSQL Multi-AZ DB clusters don't support the following extensions: `aws_s3` and
`pg_transport`.

- RDS for PostgreSQL Multi-AZ DB clusters don't support using a custom DNS server for outbound network
access.
