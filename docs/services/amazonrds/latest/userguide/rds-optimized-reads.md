# Improving query performance for RDS for MySQL with Amazon RDS Optimized Reads

You can achieve faster query processing for RDS for MySQL with Amazon RDS Optimized Reads. An
RDS for MySQL DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster that uses RDS Optimized Reads can achieve up to 2x faster
query processing compared to a DB instance or cluster that doesn't use it.

## Overview of RDS Optimized Reads

When you use an RDS for MySQL DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster that has RDS Optimized Reads turned
on, it achieves faster query performance through the use of an instance store. An
_instance store_ provides temporary block-level
storage for your DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster. The storage is located on Non-Volatile Memory
Express (NVMe) solid state drives (SSDs) that are physically attached to the host
server. This storage is optimized for low latency, high random I/O performance, and high
sequential read throughput.

RDS Optimized Reads is turned on by default when a DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster uses a DB
instance class with an instance store, such as db.m5d or db.m6gd. With RDS Optimized
Reads, some temporary objects are stored on the instance store. These temporary objects
include internal temporary files, internal on-disk temp tables, memory map files, and
binary log (binlog) cache files. For more information about the instance store, see
[Amazon EC2\
instance store](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/instancestorage.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide for_
_Linux Instances_.

The workloads that generate temporary objects in MySQL for query processing can take
advantage of the instance store for faster query processing. This type of workload
includes queries involving sorts, hash aggregations, high-load joins, Common Table
Expressions (CTEs), and queries on unindexed columns. These instance store volumes
provide higher IOPS and performance, regardless of the storage configurations used for
persistent Amazon EBS storage. Because RDS Optimized Reads offloads operations on temporary
objects to the instance store, the input/output operations per second (IOPS) or
throughput of the persistent storage (Amazon EBS) can now be used for operations on
persistent objects. These operations include regular data file reads and writes,
and background engine operations, such as flushing and insert buffer merges.

###### Note

Both manual and automated RDS snapshots only contain engine files for persistent
objects. The temporary objects created in the instance store aren't included in RDS
snapshots.

## Use cases for RDS Optimized Reads

If you have workloads that rely heavily on temporary objects, such as internal tables
or files, for their query execution, then you can benefit from turning on RDS Optimized
Reads. The following use cases are candidates for RDS Optimized Reads:

- Applications that run analytical queries with complex common table expressions
(CTEs), derived tables, and grouping operations

- Read replicas that serve heavy read traffic with unoptimized queries

- Applications that run on-demand or dynamic reporting queries that involve
complex operations, such as queries with `GROUP BY` and `ORDER
                          BY` clauses

- Workloads that use internal temporary tables for query processing

You can monitor the engine status variable `created_tmp_disk_tables` to determine the number of
disk-based temporary tables created on your DB instance.

- Applications that create large temporary tables, either directly or in procedures, to
store intermediate results

- Database queries that perform grouping or ordering on non-indexed columns

## Best practices for RDS Optimized Reads

Use the following best practices for RDS Optimized Reads:

- Add retry logic for read-only queries in case they fail because the instance
store is full during the execution.

- Monitor the storage space available on the instance store with the CloudWatch metric `FreeLocalStorage`.
If the instance store is reaching its limit because of workload on the DB instance, modify the DB instance to
use a larger DB instance class.

- When your DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster has sufficient memory but is still reaching the
storage limit on the instance store, increase the `binlog_cache_size`
value to maintain the session-specific binlog entries in memory. This
configuration prevents writing the binlog entries to temporary binlog cache
files on disk.

The `binlog_cache_size` parameter is session-specific. You can
change the value for each new session. The setting for this parameter can
increase the memory utilization on the DB instance during peak workload.
Therefore, consider increasing the parameter value based on the workload pattern
of your application and available memory on the DB instance.

- For MySQL 8.0 versions and lower, use the default value of `MIXED`
for the `binlog_format` parameter. Depending on the size of the
transactions, setting `binlog_format` to `ROW` can result
in large binlog cache files on the instance store. For MySQL 8.4 and higher, use
the default value of `ROW` for the `binlog_format`
parameter.

- Set the [internal\_tmp\_mem\_storage\_engine](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html) parameter to
`TempTable`, and set the [temptable\_max\_mmap](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html) parameter to match the size of the available
storage on the instance store.

- Avoid performing bulk changes in a single transaction. These types of
transactions can generate large binlog cache files on the instance store and can
cause issues when the instance store is full. Consider splitting writes into
multiple small transactions to minimize storage use for binlog cache
files.

- Use the default value of `ABORT_SERVER` for the `binlog_error_action` parameter. Doing so avoids issues
with the binary logging on DB instances with backups enabled.

## Using RDS Optimized Reads

When you provision an RDS for MySQL DB instance with one of the following DB instance
classes in a Single-AZ DB instance deployment, Multi-AZ DB instance deployment, or Multi-AZ DB cluster
deployment, the DB instance automatically uses RDS Optimized Reads.

To turn on RDS Optimized Reads, do one of the following:

- Create an RDS for MySQL DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster using one of these DB instance
classes. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md).

- Modify an existing RDS for MySQL DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster to use one of these DB
instance classes. For more information, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

RDS Optimized Reads is available in all AWS Regions RDS where one or more of the DB
instance classes with local NVMe SSD storage are supported. For information about DB
instance classes, see [DB instance classes](concepts-dbinstanceclass.md).

DB instance class availability differs for AWS Regions. To determine whether a DB instance class is supported
in a specific AWS Region, see [Determining DB instance class support in AWS Regions](concepts-dbinstanceclass-regionsupport.md).

If you don't want to use RDS Optimized Reads, modify your DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster so that
it doesn't use a DB instance class that supports the feature.

## Monitoring DB instances that use RDS Optimized Reads

You can monitor DB instances that use RDS Optimized Reads with the following CloudWatch metrics:

- `FreeLocalStorage`

- `ReadIOPSLocalStorage`

- `ReadLatencyLocalStorage`

- `ReadThroughputLocalStorage`

- `WriteIOPSLocalStorage`

- `WriteLatencyLocalStorage`

- `WriteThroughputLocalStorage`

These metrics provide data about available instance store storage, IOPS, and throughput. For more information
about these metrics, see [Amazon CloudWatch instance-level metrics for Amazon RDS](rds-metrics.md#rds-cw-metrics-instance).

## Limitations for RDS Optimized Reads

The following limitations apply to RDS Optimized Reads:

- RDS Optimized Reads is supported for the following versions:

- RDS for MySQL version 8.0.28 and higher major and minor
versions

For information about RDS for MySQL versions, see [MySQL on Amazon RDS versions](mysql-concepts-versionmgmt.md).

- You can't change the location of temporary objects to persistent storage (Amazon EBS) on the DB
instance classes that support RDS Optimized Reads.

- When binary logging is enabled on a DB instance, the maximum transaction size is limited by the
size of the instance store. In MySQL, any session that requires more storage
than the value of `binlog_cache_size` writes transaction changes to temporary binlog
cache files, which are created on the instance store.

- Transactions can fail when the instance store is full.
