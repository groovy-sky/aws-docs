# Monitoring the status of a task

To track the status of your granting or revoking task, call the
`rds_fn_task_status` function. It takes two parameters. The first
parameter should always be `NULL` because it doesn't apply to SSRS. The
second parameter accepts a task ID.

To see a list of all tasks, set the first parameter to `NULL` and the second
parameter to `0`, as shown in the following example.

```SQL

SELECT * FROM msdb.dbo.rds_fn_task_status(NULL,0);
```

To get a specific task, set the first parameter to `NULL` and the second
parameter to the task ID, as shown in the following example.

```SQL

SELECT * FROM msdb.dbo.rds_fn_task_status(NULL,42);
```

The `rds_fn_task_status` function returns the following information.
