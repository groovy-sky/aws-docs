# Switching a blue/green deployment in Amazon RDS

A _switchover_ transitions the green environment
to be the new production environment. When the green DB instance has read replicas, they are also
transitioned. Before you switch over, production traffic is routed to the DB instance and read
replicas in the blue environment. After you switch over, production traffic is routed to the
DB instance and read replicas in the green environment.

_Switching over_ a blue/green deployment is not the same as
_promoting_ the green DB instance
within the blue/green deployment. If you manually
promote the green DB instance
by choosing **Promote** from the
**Actions** menu, replication between the blue and green environments breaks
and the blue/green deployment enters a state of **Invalid configuration**.

## Switchover timeout

You can specify a switchover timeout period between 30 seconds and 3,600 seconds
(one hour). If the switchover takes longer than the specified duration, then
any changes are rolled back and no changes are made to either environment. The default timeout
period is 300 seconds (five minutes).

## Switchover guardrails

When you start a switchover, Amazon RDS runs some basic checks to test the readiness of the
blue and green environments for switchover. These checks are known as _switchover_
_guardrails_. These switchover guardrails prevent a switchover if the environments
aren't ready for it. Therefore, they avoid longer than expected downtime and prevent the loss
of data between the blue and green environments that might result if the switchover started.

Amazon RDS runs the following guardrail checks on the green environment:

- **Replication health** – Checks if green primary DB instance
replication status is healthy. The green primary DB instance is
a replica of the blue primary DB instance.

- **Replication lag** – Checks if the replica lag
of the green primary DB instance
is within allowable limits for switchover. The
allowable limits are based on the specified timeout period. Replica lag indicates how far
the green primary DB instance is lagging behind its blue primary
DB instance. For more information, see [Monitoring replica lag prior to switchover](#blue-green-deployments-monitor-replica-lag).

- **Active writes** – Makes sure there are no
active writes on the green primary DB instance.

Amazon RDS runs the following guardrail checks on the blue environment:

- **External replication** – For RDS for PostgreSQL, makes sure that the blue environment isn't a self-managed
logical source (publisher) or replica (subscriber). If it is, we recommend that you drop
the self-managed replication slots and subscriptions across all databases in the blue
environment, proceed with switchover, then recreate them to resume replication. For
RDS for MySQL
and RDS for MariaDB, checks whether the blue database isn't an external binlog
replica. If it is, make sure that it is not actively replicating.

- **Long-running active writes** – Makes sure
there are no long-running active writes on the blue primary
DB instance because they can increase
replica lag.

- **Long-running DDL statements** – Makes sure
there are no long-running DDL statements on the blue primary
DB instance because they can increase
replica lag.

- **Unsupported PostgreSQL changes** – For RDS for PostgreSQL
blue/green deployments that use logical replication, makes sure that no DDL
changes and no additions or modifications of large objects have been performed on the blue
environment. For more information, see [Logical replication-specific limitations for blue/green deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/blue-green-deployments-considerations.html#blue-green-deployments-limitations-postgres).

If Amazon RDS detects unsupported PostgreSQL changes, it changes the replication state to
`Replication degraded` and notifies you that switchover is not available for
the blue/green deployment. To proceed with switchover, we recommend that you delete and
recreate the blue/green deployment and all green databases. To do so, choose
**Actions**, **Delete with green databases**.

## Switchover actions

When you switch over a blue/green deployment, RDS performs the following actions:

1. Runs guardrail checks to verify if the blue and green environments are ready for switchover.

2. Stops new write operations on the primary DB instance
    in both environments.

3. Drops connections to the DB instances in both environments and doesn't allow new connections.

4. Waits for replication to catch up in the green environment so that the green environment
    is in sync with the blue environment.

5. Renames the DB instances
    in the both environments.

RDS renames the DB instances
    in the green environment to match the corresponding
    DB instances in the
    blue environment. For example, assume the name of a DB instance in the blue environment is
    `mydb`. Also assume the name of the corresponding DB instance in the green environment is
    `mydb-green-abc123`. During switchover, the name of the DB instance in the green environment is
    changed to `mydb`.

RDS renames the DB instances
    in the blue environment by
    appending `-oldn` to the current name, where
    `n` is a number. For example, assume the name of
    a DB instance in the blue environment is `mydb`. After switchover, the DB
    instance name might be `mydb-old1`.

RDS also renames the endpoints in the green environment to match the corresponding endpoints in the
    blue environment so that application changes aren't required.

6. Allows connections to databases in both environments.

7. Allows write operations on the primary DB instance
    in the new production environment.

After switchover, the previous production primary
    DB instance
    only allows read operations until you set the `read_only` parameter (for
    RDS for MySQL) or the `default_transaction_read_only` parameter (for
    RDS for PostgreSQL) to `0` and reboot the DB instance.

You can monitor the status of a switchover using Amazon EventBridge. For more information, see [Blue/green deployment events](user-events-messages.md#USER_Events.Messages.BlueGreenDeployments).

During switchover, tags from the blue environment replace all tags on resources in the
green environment. Any tags that you added directly to green environment resources are
overwritten during this process. For more information about tags, see [Tagging Amazon RDS resources](user-tagging.md).

If the switchover starts and then stops before finishing for any reason, then any changes are rolled back,
and no changes are made to either environment.

## Switchover best practices

Before you switch over, we strongly recommend that you adhere to best practices by
completing the following tasks:

- Thoroughly test the resources in the green environment. Make sure they function properly
and efficiently.

- Monitor relevant Amazon CloudWatch metrics. For more information, see [Verifying CloudWatch metrics before switchover](#blue-green-deployments-switching-over-cloudwatch).

- Identify the best time for the switchover.

During the switchover, writes are cut off from databases in both environments.
Identify a time when traﬃc is lowest on your production environment. Long-running
transactions, such as active DDLs, can increase your switchover time, resulting in longer
downtime for your production workloads.

If there's a large number of connections on your DB instances, consider manually
reducing them to the minimum amount necessary for your application before you switch over
the blue/green deployment. One way to achieve this is to create a script that monitors the
status of the blue/green deployment and starts cleaning up connections when it detects
that the status has changed to `SWITCHOVER_IN_PROGRESS`.

- Make sure the DB instances
in both environments are in `Available` state.

- Make sure the primary DB instance
in the green environment is healthy and replicating.

- Make sure that your network and client configurations don’t increase the DNS cache
Time-To-Live (TTL) beyond five seconds, which is the default for RDS DNS zones.
Otherwise, applications will continue to send write traffic to the blue environment after
switchover.

- Make sure data loading is complete before switching over. For more information, see
[Lazy loading and storage initialization for blue/green deployments](blue-green-deployments-creating.md#blue-green-deployments-creating-lazy-loading).

- For RDS for PostgreSQL blue/green deployments that use logical
replication, do the following:

- Review the logical replication limitations and take any required actions prior to
switchover. For more information, see [Logical replication-specific limitations for blue/green deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/blue-green-deployments-considerations.html#blue-green-deployments-limitations-postgres).

- Run the `ANALYZE` operation to refresh the `pg_statistics`
table. This reduces the risk of performance issues after switchover.

- Before initiating a blue/green deployment switchover, verify that your application
does not override the `default_transaction_read_only` parameter at the
session level. During switchover, this parameter is set to `on` on the
green environment writer to prevent writes until promotion completes. If your
application or transactions override this configuration to `off`, your
application may write data to the green environment during the switchover
process. In the event the switchover has to roll back, these writes are not
available in the blue environment, requiring you to manually resolve the data
inconsistencies. We strongly recommend auditing your application queries to ensure
they respect the `default_transaction_read_only` setting before proceeding
with switchover.

###### Note

During a switchover, you can't modify any DB instances
included in the switchover.

## Verifying CloudWatch metrics before switchover

Before you switch over a blue/green deployment, we recommend that you check the
value of the following metric within
Amazon CloudWatch.

- `DatabaseConnections` – Use this metric to estimate the level of
activity on the blue/green deployment, and make sure that the value is at an acceptable
level for your deployment before you switch over. If Performance Insights is turned on,
`DBLoad` is a more accurate metric.

For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon RDS](rds-metrics.md).

## Monitoring replica lag prior to switchover

Before you switch over a blue/green deployment, make sure that replica lag is close to
zero in order to reduce downtime.

### RDS for MySQL and RDS for MariaDB

For MySQL and MariaDB blue/green deployments,
check the `ReplicaLag` CloudWatch metric in the green
environment to identify the current replica lag. For more information, see [Diagnosing and resolving lag between read replicas](chap-troubleshooting.md#CHAP_Troubleshooting.MySQL.ReplicaLag).

### RDS for PostgreSQL

For PostgreSQL blue/green deployments that use physical
replication, see [Monitoring and tuning the replication process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PostgreSQL.Replication.ReadReplicas.Monitor.html) for
instructions to identify the current replica lag.

For PostgreSQL blue/green deployments that use logical
replication, check the `OldestReplicationSlotLag` CloudWatch metric in the
blue environment to identify the current replica lag. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch instance-level metrics for Amazon RDS](rds-metrics.md#rds-cw-metrics-instance).

In addition, you can run the following SQL query in the blue
environment:

```sql

SELECT slot_name,
       confirmed_flush_lsn as flushed,
       pg_current_wal_lsn(),
       (pg_current_wal_lsn() - confirmed_flush_lsn) AS lsn_distance
FROM pg_catalog.pg_replication_slots
WHERE slot_type = 'logical';

slot_name        |    flushed    | pg_current_wal_lsn | lsn_distance
-----------------+---------------+--------------------+------------
logical_replica1 | 47D97/CF32980 | 47D97/CF3BAC8      | 37192
```

The `confirmed_flush_lsn` represents the last log sequence number (LSN) that
was sent to the replica. The `pg_current_wal_lsn` represents where the database
is now. An `lsn_distance` of 0 means that the replica is caught up.

For an explanation of when blue/green deployments use physical
replication versus logical replication, see [PostgreSQL replication methods for blue/green deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/blue-green-deployments-replication-type.html).

## Switching over a blue/green deployment

You can switch over a blue/green deployment using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

###### To switch over a blue/green deployment

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then choose the blue/green deployment that you want
    to switch over.

3. For **Actions**, choose **Switch over**.

The **Switch over** page appears.

![Switch over blue/green deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/blue-green-deployment-switch-over.png)

4. On the **Switch over** page, review the switchover summary. Make sure
    the resources in both environments match what you expect. If they don't, choose
    **Cancel**.

5. For **Timeout settings**, enter the time limit for
    switchover.

6. If your instance is running
    RDS for PostgreSQL, review and acknowledge the pre-switchover recommendations.
    For more information, see [Logical replication-specific limitations for blue/green deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/blue-green-deployments-considerations.html#blue-green-deployments-limitations-postgres).

7. Choose **Switch over**.

To switch over a blue/green deployment by using the AWS CLI, use the [switchover-blue-green-deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/switchover-blue-green-deployment.html) command with the following options:

- `--blue-green-deployment-identifier` – Specify the resource ID
of the blue/green deployment.

- `--switchover-timeout` – Specify the time limit for the switchover, in seconds. The default is
300.

###### Example Switch over a blue/green deployment

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds switchover-blue-green-deployment \
    --blue-green-deployment-identifier bgd-1234567890abcdef \
    --switchover-timeout 600
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds switchover-blue-green-deployment ^
    --blue-green-deployment-identifier bgd-1234567890abcdef ^
    --switchover-timeout 600
```

To switch over a blue/green deployment by using the Amazon RDS API, use the [`SwitchoverBlueGreenDeployment`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_SwitchoverBlueGreenDeployment.html) operation with the following parameters:

- `BlueGreenDeploymentIdentifier` – Specify the resource ID of
the blue/green deployment.

- `SwitchoverTimeout` – Specify the time limit for the switchover, in seconds. The default is
300.

## After switchover

After a switchover, the DB instances
in the previous blue environment are retained. Standard costs apply to these resources. Replication between the blue and green environments stops.

RDS renames the DB instances in the blue environment by appending
`-oldn` to the current resource name, where
`n` is a number. The
DB instances in the old blue environment are read-only until you set the `read_only`
parameter (for RDS for MySQL) or the `default_transaction_read_only` parameter (for
RDS for PostgreSQL) to `0`.

RDS names the DB instances in the green environment
`-newn`.

If you delete the blue/green deployment resource, RDS retains the
`-oldn` and
`-newn` resources.

![After switching over a blue/green deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/blue-green-deployment-after-switchover.png)

### Updating the parent node for consumers

RDS offers fully managed read replicas. However, it also provides the option to set up
self-managed replicas, also known as _external replicas._ External
replicas allow you to use third-party resources as replication targets.

After you switch over an RDS for MariaDB or
RDS for MySQL blue/green deployment,
if the blue DB instance
had any external replicas or binary log consumers
prior to switchover, you must update their parent node after switchover in order to maintain
replication continuity.

###### To update the parent node

1. After switchover, the DB instance that was
    previously in the green environment emits an event that contains the master log file
    name and master log position. To locate the event, navigate to the RDS console and
    choose **Events** from the left navigation pane.

2. Filter by events where the source is the name of the old green DB instance, before switchover.

3. Locate the event that contains the binary log coordinates. The event message is
    similar to: `Binary log coordinates in green environment after switchover: file
                   mysql-bin-changelog.000003 and position
                   40134574`.

4. Make sure that the consumer or replica has applied all binary logs from the old blue
    environment. Then, use the provided binary log coordinates to resume replication on the
    consumers. For example, if you're running a MySQL replica on EC2, you can use the
    following commands:

**MySQL 8.0.22 and lower major and minor**
**versions**

```nohighlight

CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='{new-writer-endpoint}', MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin-changelog.000003', MASTER_LOG_POS=40134574;
```

**MySQL 8.0.23 and higher major and minor**
**versions**

```nohighlight

CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_HOST='{new-writer-endpoint}', SOURCE_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin-changelog.000003', SOURCE_LOG_POS=40134574;
```

If the consumer is another RDS for MySQL or RDS for MariaDB DB instance, run the
following stored procedures in order:

1. [mysql.rds\_stop\_replication](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_stop_replication)

2. [mysql.rds\_reset\_external\_master](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_reset_external_master) (for version 8.0 and lower) or [mysql\_rds\_reset\_external\_source](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_reset_external_source) (for
    version 8.4 and higher)

3. [mysql.rds\_set\_external\_master](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_set_external_master) (for version 8.0 and lower) or [mysql\_rds\_set\_external\_source](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_set_external_source) (for
    version 8.4 and higher)

4. [mysql.rds\_start\_replication](mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_start_replication)
