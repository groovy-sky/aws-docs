# Working with trace and dump files for Amazon RDS for SQL Server

This section describes working with trace files and dump files for your Amazon RDS DB
instances running Microsoft SQL Server.

## Generating a trace SQL query

```sql

declare @rc int
declare @TraceID int
declare @maxfilesize bigint

set @maxfilesize = 5

exec @rc = sp_trace_create @TraceID output,  0, N'D:\rdsdbdata\log\rdstest', @maxfilesize, NULL
```

## Viewing an open trace

```sql

select * from ::fn_trace_getinfo(default)
```

## Viewing trace contents

```sql

select * from ::fn_trace_gettable('D:\rdsdbdata\log\rdstest.trc', default)
```

## Setting the retention period for trace and dump files

Trace and dump files can accumulate and consume disk space. By default, Amazon RDS
purges trace and dump files that are older than seven days.

To view the current trace and dump file retention period, use the
`rds_show_configuration` procedure, as shown in the following
example.

```sql

exec rdsadmin..rds_show_configuration;
```

To modify the retention period for trace files, use the
`rds_set_configuration` procedure and set the `tracefile
					retention` in minutes. The following example sets the trace file retention
period to 24 hours.

```sql

exec rdsadmin..rds_set_configuration 'tracefile retention', 1440;
```

To modify the retention period for dump files, use the
`rds_set_configuration` procedure and set the `dumpfile
					retention` in minutes. The following example sets the dump file retention
period to 3 days.

```sql

exec rdsadmin..rds_set_configuration 'dumpfile retention', 4320;
```

For security reasons, you cannot delete a specific trace or dump file on a SQL
Server DB instance. To delete all unused trace or dump files, set the retention
period for the files to 0.
