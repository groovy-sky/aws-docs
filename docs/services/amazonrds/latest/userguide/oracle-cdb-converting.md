# Converting an RDS for Oracle non-CDB to a CDB

You can change the architecture of an Oracle database from the non-CDB architecture to the
Oracle multitenant architecture, also called the _CDB architecture_, with
the `modify-db-instance` command. In most cases, this technique is preferable to
creating a new CDB and importing data. The conversion operation incurs downtime.

When you upgrade your database engine version, you can't change the database architecture
in the same operation. Therefore, to upgrade an Oracle Database 19c non-CDB to an Oracle Database 21c CDB, you first
need to convert the non-CDB to a CDB in one step, and then upgrade the 19c CDB to a 21c CDB
in a separate step.

The non-CDB conversion operation has the following requirements:

- You must specify `oracle-ee-cdb` or `oracle-se2-cdb` for the
DB engine type. These are the only supported values.

- Your DB engine must use Oracle Database 19c with an April 2021 or later release update
(RU).

The operation has the following limitations:

- You can't convert a CDB to a non-CDB. You can only convert a non-CDB to a
CDB.

- You can't convert a non-CDB to the multi-tenant configuration in a single
`modify-db-instance` call. After you convert a non-CDB to a CDB, your
CDB is in the single-tenant configuration. To convert the single-tenant
configuration to the multi-tenant configuration, run `modify-db-instance`
again. For more information, see [Converting the single-tenant configuration to multi-tenant](oracle-single-tenant-converting.md).

- You can't convert a primary or replica database that has Oracle Data Guard
enabled. To convert a non-CDB that has read replicas, first delete all read
replicas.

- You can't upgrade the DB engine version and convert a non-CDB to a CDB in the same
operation.

Before converting your non-CDB, consider the following:

- The considerations for option and parameter groups are the same as for upgrading
the DB engine. For more information, see [Considerations for Oracle database upgrades](user-upgradedbinstance-oracle-ogpg.md).

- You can convert existing non-CDB instances that uses managed master passwords to
single-tenant instances in a single operation. The single-tenant instances inherit
the managed passwords.

- If your DB instance has the `OEMAGENT` option installed, a best practice is
to remove this option before you convert your non-CDB. After your non-CDB is
converted to a CDB, reinstall the option. For more information, see [Oracle Management Agent for Enterprise Manager Cloud Control](oracle-options-oemagent.md).

- During the conversion process, RDS resets the online redo log size to the default
128M.

###### To convert a non-CDB to a CDB

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

02. In the upper-right corner of the Amazon RDS console, choose the AWS Region
     where your DB instance resides.

03. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then
     choose the non-CDB instance that you want to convert to a CDB instance.

04. Choose **Modify**.

05. For **Architecture settings**, select **Oracle**
    **multitenant architecture**. After conversion, your CDB will be
     in the single-tenant configuration.

06. (Optional) For **DB parameter group**, choose a new
     parameter group for your CDB instance. The same parameter group
     considerations apply when converting a DB instance as when upgrading a DB instance. For
     more information, see [Parameter group considerations](user-upgradedbinstance-oracle-ogpg.md#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Oracle.OGPG.PG).

07. (Optional) For **Option group**, choose a new option
     group for your CDB instance. The same option group considerations apply when
     converting a DB instance as when upgrading a DB instance. For more information, see
     [Option group considerations](user-upgradedbinstance-oracle-ogpg.md#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Oracle.OGPG.OG).

08. (Optional) For **Credentials management**, choose
     **Managed in AWS Secrets Manager** or
     **Self-managed**. For more information, see [Managing the master user password for a DB instance with Secrets Manager](rds-secrets-manager.md#rds-secrets-manager-db-instance).

09. When all the changes are as you want them, choose
     **Continue** and check the summary of modifications.

10. (Optional) Choose **Apply immediately** to apply the
     changes immediately. Choosing this option can cause downtime in some cases.
     For more information, see [Using the schedule modifications setting](user-modifyinstance-applyimmediately.md).

11. On the confirmation page, review your changes. If they are correct, choose
     **Modify DB instance**.

    Or choose **Back** to edit your changes or
     **Cancel** to cancel your changes.

To convert the non-CDB on your DB instance to a CDB in the single-tenant configuration,
set `--engine` to `oracle-ee-cdb` or
`oracle-se2-cdb` in the AWS CLI command [modify-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.md). For
more information, see [Settings for DB instances](user-modifyinstance-settings.md).

The following example converts the DB instance named
`my-non-cdb` and specifies a custom option group and
parameter group. The command also enables password management with
Secrets Manager.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier my-non-cdb \
    --engine oracle-ee-cdb \
    --option-group-name custom-option-group \
    --db-parameter-group-name custom-parameter-group \
    --manage-master-user-password
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier my-non-cdb ^
    --engine oracle-ee-cdb ^
    --option-group-name custom-option-group ^
    --db-parameter-group-name custom-parameter-group ^
    --manage-master-user-password
```

To convert a non-CDB to a CDB, specify `Engine` in the RDS API
operation [ModifyDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbinstance.md).
