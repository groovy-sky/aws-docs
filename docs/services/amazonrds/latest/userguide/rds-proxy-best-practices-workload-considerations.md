## Multi-tenant and multi-user environments

When it comes to scalability and improving connection management, the benefits of
using RDS Proxy depend on its ability to perform connection pooling and, to a much
greater extent, connection multiplexing. Connection pooling reduces the overhead
associated with opening and closing connections. Connection multiplexing allows the
proxy to reuse a back-end database connection after a transaction. For more
information, see [RDS Proxy concepts and terminology](rds-proxy-howitworks.md).

When a connection can't be multiplexed, the proxy falls back to a behavior called
_connection pinning_. Pinning is a situation where a client is
forced to use the same underlying proxy connection for its entire session. The proxy
connection is reserved for that one client, so it's not available for reuse by other
clients. In other words, pinning creates an exclusive 1:1 association between a
client-proxy connection and a proxy-database connection. Avoiding pinning is important
in all scenarios where RDS Proxy is used mainly for scalability and efficiency
reasons. For the most current pinning behavior, see [Avoiding pinning an RDS Proxy](rds-proxy-pinning.md).

As a general rule, connections can be multiplexed when they have identical state.
Connections can't be multiplexed when they contain custom session-specific state
information. One of the aspects defining session state is the database user name
associated with a connection. When you connect to the proxy as "user\_A", the proxy
needs to open a back-end database connection as "user\_A" as well. The proxy can
potentially pool and reuse this back-end connection for other clients that log in as
"user\_A", but not for clients using a different user name.

This behavior can significantly reduce pooling and multiplexing efficiency in
multi-user environments with a large number of unique database accounts. This is
particularly true in architectures using database-level or schema-level multi-tenancy.
If the database contains a thousand schemas (one per tenant) and each tenant connects
to the database with a different user name, the connection pool becomes fragmented
into user-specific micro-pools, reducing overall efficiency.

Additionally, aspects specific to the database engine might further affect pooling
efficiency and the proxy's ability to multiplex connections:

1. In Amazon RDS and Aurora PostgreSQL, multi-tenancy is often implemented
    by using one database per tenant. However, in PostgreSQL, connections are
    database-specific: a connection opened against one database can't access data
    from other databases. Therefore, database-level multi-tenancy reduces the
    efficiency of pooling and multiplexing at the proxy level. This consideration
    also applies if the workload uses schema-level multi-tenancy and client
    sessions use a custom `search_path`. However, if all sessions use the
    default search path and refer to tables using fully qualified names
    ( `schema_name.table_name`), those sessions can be multiplexed.

2. In Amazon RDS and Aurora MySQL, the terms "database" and "schema" are synonyms.
    Multi-tenancy is often implemented by using one schema per tenant, which in
    MySQL is the same as one database per tenant. Connections are opened against a
    MySQL server as a whole and are not tied to a schema. If the application
    uses schema-level multi-tenancy, connection multiplexing is still possible for
    clients using the same database user name, even if those connections need to
    access data in different schemas. Multiplexing will be most effective if
    tenant separation is done at the application level instead of using
    different database accounts for each tenant.

In multi-schema environments, multiplexing efficiency depends on how you refer to
table names:

- For clients that choose the current schema using session variables
( `SET search_path ...` in PostgreSQL and `USE schema;`
in MySQL) and then use unqualified table names in queries (such as
`SELECT ... FROM table_name`), connection multiplexing only works
between clients using the same schema or the same search path.

- For clients that don't modify session state to define the current schema, but
instead use fully qualified table names in the SQL statements (such as
`SELECT ... FROM schema_name.table_name`), multiplexing is not
similarly constrained.

## Databases serving multiple applications or software stacks

As discussed in the preceding section, certain connection state characteristics don't
cause pinning, but still reduce the proxy's ability to reuse connections between different clients.
When used with MySQL targets, RDS Proxy tracks a number of statements and session variables that
configure session state, such as the character set, time zone, and collation settings.
When a client uses tracked statements or variables to configure session settings, the
proxy connection can only be reused for other clients that have the same values for
those settings.

As a result, certain application and driver behaviors might reduce your ability to
reuse connections inside of the proxy. For example, you might allow different
applications to connect to the database using the same user name, assuming that the
proxy can reuse and multiplex connections between those applications. However, if one
application bootstraps connections with time zone A
( `SET time_zone = ?`) and another application uses time zone B,
connections are reusable within an application but not between applications. This
leads to fragmentation of the connection pool, negatively affecting the effectiveness
of pooling and multiplexing.

For more information, see [What RDS Proxy tracks for RDS for MariaDB and RDS for MySQL databases](rds-proxy-pinning.md#rds-proxy-pinning.mysql-tracked-vars). Session state tracking is not
currently supported for database targets other than MySQL.

See [Configuration guidelines](rds-proxy-best-practices-configuration.md) for configuration guidelines and best practices for
managing session state to avoid connection pinning.

## Using application-level pooling and advanced drivers with RDS Proxy

RDS Proxy helps improve scalability and connection efficiency in situations where
the application itself is not using connection pooling. At the same time, many drivers
and frameworks do include pooling features. You might also be using advanced
wrappers or drivers that implement some of the proxy's features at the driver level.

Using application-level pooling and other connection handling improvements does not
inherently conflict with using RDS Proxy, and doesn't negate its benefits. For
example, you might be using connection pooling in your application containers, but the
number of containers is large enough that you'd still run out of database connection
limits without using a proxy. When using RDS Proxy with application-level pools and
other connection-related features, review and understand the reasons for advanced
connection-handling features to exist at the application level. Decide which of those
features are worth keeping (or are harmless), and which can overlap or interfere with
the proxy behavior. For example:

1. Pooling features built into drivers and frameworks can be useful even if they
    appear to overlap with the RDS Proxy functionality. If an application-level
    pool improves local connection efficiency on top of the benefits provided by
    the proxy, you can keep it.

2. Features related to failover handling might interfere with RDS Proxy logic
    or increase the overall stack complexity without providing benefits. For
    example, if your application is actively tracking the topology of your Aurora
    clusters to avoid DNS-related failover delays, it no longer needs to do so
    with RDS Proxy. Keeping this topology tracking logic might lead to
    undesirable behavior, such as the application threads bypassing the proxy and
    connecting directly to individual database instances. In this scenario, you
    can disable the application-level tracking logic and let RDS Proxy abstract
    the cluster topology for you.

3. Connection pooling libraries might use state management features that seem
    beneficial in theory, but interfere with proxy behavior. One such example is
    PostgreSQL libraries calling the `DISCARD ALL` query to reset
    connection state between borrows. It might seem that resetting connections
    should help with pooling and multiplexing, but it interferes with Amazon RDS
    Proxy's internal session state management. When using `DISCARD`,
    the proxy pins your client connection on release, reducing the multiplexing
    efficiency.

For any application-level connection handling components you do keep, ensure their
configuration doesn't interfere with the connection handling logic used by Amazon RDS
Proxy. For example:

- Align pool sizing across all layers of the stack. If the application-level
pools are over-sized (or your proxy pool is under-sized), the application
may try to open connections that the proxy isn't configured to handle. Those
connections can experience delays at best and rejection errors at worst.

- Align timeout settings to reduce churn and avoid confusion around connection
behavior. If the application pool keeps connections alive for 300 seconds, but
the proxy is configured to close connections after 60 seconds, the application
will see premature connection closures instead of the expected behavior.

Some of these architectural decisions and configuration choices might require testing
and experimentation. It's not always possible to exactly predict application behavior
in an environment with multiple layers of pooling and connection management.
