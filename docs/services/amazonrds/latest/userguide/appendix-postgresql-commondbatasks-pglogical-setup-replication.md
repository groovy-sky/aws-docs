# Setting up logical replication for RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance

The following procedure shows you how to start logical replication between two RDS for PostgreSQL DB instances. The steps assume that both the source (publisher) and
the target (subscriber) have the `pglogical` extension set up as detailed in [Setting up the pglogical extension](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-pglogical-basic-setup.md).

###### Note

The `node_name` of a subscriber node can't start with `rds`.

###### To create the publisher node and define the tables to replicate

These steps assume that your RDS for PostgreSQL DB
instance has a database that has one or more tables that you want to replicate to
another node. You need to recreate the table structure from the publisher on the subscriber,
so first, get the table structure if necessary. You can do that by using the
`psql` metacommand `\d tablename` and
then creating the same table on the subscriber instance. The following procedure creates an
example table on the publisher (source) for demonstration purposes.

1. Use `psql` to connect to the instance that has the table you want to use as
    a source for subscribers.

```nohighlight

psql --host=source-instance.aws-region.rds.amazonaws.com --port=5432 --username=postgres --password --dbname=labdb

```

If you don't have an existing table that you want to replicate, you can create a
    sample table as follows.
1. Create an example table using the following SQL statement.

      ```nohighlight

      CREATE TABLE docs_lab_table (a int PRIMARY KEY);
      ```

2. Populate the table with generated data by using the following SQL
       statement.

      ```nohighlight

      INSERT INTO docs_lab_table VALUES (generate_series(1,5000));
      INSERT 0 5000
      ```

3. Verify that data exists in the table by using the following SQL statement.

      ```nohighlight

      SELECT count(*) FROM docs_lab_table;
      ```
2. Identify this RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance as the publisher node, as
    follows.

```nohighlight

SELECT pglogical.create_node(
       node_name := 'docs_lab_provider',
       dsn := 'host=source-instance.aws-region.rds.amazonaws.com port=5432 dbname=labdb');
    create_node
   -------------
      3410995529
(1 row)
```

3. Add the table that you want to replicate to the default replication set. For more
    information about replication sets, see [Replication sets](https://github.com/2ndQuadrant/pglogical/tree/REL2_x_STABLE/docs) in the pglogical documentation.

```nohighlight

SELECT pglogical.replication_set_add_table('default', 'docs_lab_table', 'true', NULL, NULL);
    replication_set_add_table
     ---------------------------
     t
     (1 row)
```

The publisher node setup is complete. You can now set up the subscriber node to receive
the updates from the publisher.

###### To set up the subscriber node and create a subscription to receive updates

These steps assume that the
RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance has been set up with the
`pglogical` extension. For more information, see [Setting up the pglogical extension](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-pglogical-basic-setup.md).

1. Use `psql` to connect to the instance that you want to receive updates from
    the publisher.

```nohighlight

psql --host=target-instance.aws-region.rds.amazonaws.com --port=5432 --username=postgres --password --dbname=labdb

```

2. On the subscriber
    RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance,create the same table
    that exists on the publisher. For this example, the table is `docs_lab_table`.
    You can create the table as follows.

```nohighlight

CREATE TABLE docs_lab_table (a int PRIMARY KEY);
```

3. Verify that this table is empty.

```nohighlight

SELECT count(*) FROM docs_lab_table;
    count
   -------
     0
(1 row)
```

4. Identify this RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance as the subscriber node, as
    follows.

```nohighlight

SELECT pglogical.create_node(
       node_name := 'docs_lab_target',
       dsn := 'host=target-instance.aws-region.rds.amazonaws.com port=5432 sslmode=require dbname=labdb user=postgres password=********');
    create_node
   -------------
      2182738256
(1 row)
```

5. Create the subscription.

```nohighlight

SELECT pglogical.create_subscription(
      subscription_name := 'docs_lab_subscription',
      provider_dsn := 'host=source-instance.aws-region.rds.amazonaws.com port=5432 sslmode=require dbname=labdb user=postgres password=*******',
      replication_sets := ARRAY['default'],
      synchronize_data := true,
      forward_origins := '{}' );
    create_subscription
   ---------------------
1038357190
(1 row)
```

When you complete this step, the data from the table on the publisher is created in
    the table on the subscriber. You can verify that this has occurred by using the following
    SQL query.

```nohighlight

SELECT count(*) FROM docs_lab_table;
    count
   -------
     5000
(1 row)
```

From this point forward, changes made to the table on the publisher are replicated to the
table on the subscriber.
