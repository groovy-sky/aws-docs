## General-purpose instance class types

The following general-purpose DB instance classes are available:

- db.m8g – General-purpose DB instance classes
powered by AWS Graviton4 processors. These instance classes deliver balanced
compute, memory, and networking for a broad range of general-purpose workloads.
Compared to seventh-generation AWS Graviton3-based M7g instances, these new
classes offer larger instance sizes with up to 3x more vCPUs and memory. They are
powered by the AWS Nitro System, a combination of dedicated hardware and
lightweight hypervisor.

You can modify a DB instance to use one of the DB instance classes powered by AWS Graviton4
processors. To do so, complete the same steps as with any other DB instance
modification.

- db.m7i – General-purpose DB instance classes
powered by 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors. The db.m7i instances are
SAP certified and ideal for supporting enterprise applications that need larger
instance sizes or high continuous CPU usage. These instance classes deliver balanced
compute, memory, and networking for a broad range of general-purpose workloads. This
instance class type delivers up to 40,000 Mbps EBS bandwidth and up to 50 Gbps
network bandwidth. The db.m7i instances deliver up to 15% better price performance
compared to db.m6i instances. They are powered by the AWS Nitro System, a
combination of dedicated hardware and lightweight hypervisor.

- db.m7g – General-purpose DB instance classes
powered by AWS Graviton3 processors. These instance classes deliver balanced
compute, memory, and networking for a broad range of general-purpose workloads. They

applications, gaming servers, caching fleets, and application development
environments. The db.m6id and db.m6idn instance classes offer up to 7.6 TB of local
NVMe-based SSD storage, whereas db.m6in offers EBS-only storage. The db.m6in and
db.m6idn classes offer up to 200 Gbps of network bandwidth. They are powered by the
AWS Nitro System, a combination of dedicated hardware and lightweight
hypervisor.

- db.m5 –General-purpose DB instance classes that
provide a balance of compute, memory, and network resources, and are a good choice
for many applications. The db.m5d instance class offers NVMe-based SSD storage that is
physically connected to the host server. The db.m5 instance classes provide more
computing capacity than the previous db.m4 instance classes. They are powered by the
AWS Nitro System, a combination of dedicated hardware and lightweight
hypervisor.

For the RDS for Oracle DB engines, Amazon RDS no longer supports db.m4
DB instance classes. If you had previously created RDS for Oracle db.m4 DB instances, Amazon RDS
automatically upgrades those DB instances to equivalent db.m5 DB instance classes.

For the RDS for MariaDB, RDS for MySQL, RDS for SQL Server, and RDS for PostgreSQL DB engines, Amazon RDS has
started the end-of-support process for this DB instance class using the following schedule. For
all RDS DB instances that use this instance class, we recommend that you upgrade to a newer
generation DB instance class as soon as possible.
