# MySQL version numbers

The version numbering sequence for the RDS for MySQL database engine is either in the
form of _major.minor.patch.YYYYMMDD_ or
_major.minor.patch_, for example, 8.0.33.R2.20231201 or 5.7.44.
The format used depends on the MySQL engine version. For information about RDS Extended Support
version numbering, see [Amazon RDS Extended Support version naming](extended-support-versions.md#extended-support-naming).

**major**

The major version number is both the integer and the first fractional part
of the version number, for example, 8.0. A major version upgrade increases
the major part of the version number. For example, an upgrade from
_5.7_.44 to 8.0.33 is a major version upgrade, where
_5.7_ and _8.0_ are the major
version numbers.

**minor**

The minor version number is the third part of the version number, for
example, the 33 in 8.0.33.

**patch**

The patch is the fourth part of the version number, for example, the R2 in
8.0.33.R2. An RDS patch version includes important bug fixes added to a
minor version after its release.

**YYYYMMDD**

The date is the fifth part of the version number, for example, the
20231201 in 8.0.33.R2.20231201. An RDS date version is a security patch that
includes important security fixes added to a minor version after its
release. It doesn't include any fixes that might change an engine's
behavior.
