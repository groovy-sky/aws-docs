# Network Validation

Before joining your RDS Custom instance to either self-managed or AWS Managed Microsoft AD, check the
following from a EC2 instance in the same VPC as where you plan to launch the RDS Custom for SQL Server instance.

- Check if you are able to resolve the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to domain controller IPs.

```

nslookup corp.example.com
```

The command must return a similar output:

```

Server:  ip-10-0-0-2.us-west-2.compute.internal
Address:  25.0.0.2

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    corp.example.com
Addresses:  40.0.9.25 (DC1 IP)
              40.0.50.123 (DC2 IP)
```

- Resolve AWS services from an EC2 instance in the VPC where you are launching your RDS Custom instance:

The `TcpTestSucceeded` value must return `True` for `s3`, `ec2`, `secretsmanager`, `logs`, `events`,
`monitoring`, `ssm`, `ec2messages`, and `ssmmessages`.
