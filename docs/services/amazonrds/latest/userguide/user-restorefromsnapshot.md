# Restoring to a DB instance

This section shows how to restore to a DB instance. This page shows how to restore to an Amazon RDS DB instance from a DB snapshot.

Amazon RDS creates a storage volume snapshot of your DB instance, backing up the entire DB instance and not
just individual databases. You can create a new DB instance by restoring from a DB snapshot. You provide
the name of the DB snapshot to restore from, and then provide a name for the new DB instance that is
created from the restore. You can't restore from a DB snapshot to an existing DB instance; you create a
new DB instance when you restore the snapshot.

You can use the restored DB instance as soon as its status is `available`. The DB instance
continues to load data in the background. This is known as _lazy_
_loading_. If you access data that hasn't been loaded yet, the DB instance
immediately downloads the requested data from Amazon S3, and then continues loading the rest of
the data in the background. For more information, see [Amazon EBS\
snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html).

To help mitigate the effects of lazy loading on tables to which you require quick access, you can perform operations that involve
full-table scans, such as `SELECT *`. This allows Amazon RDS to download all of the backed-up table data from S3.

You can restore a DB instance and use a different storage type than the source DB snapshot. In this case,
the restore process is slower because of the additional work required to migrate the data to
the new storage type. If you restore to or from magnetic storage, the migration process is
the slowest. That's because magnetic storage doesn't have the IOPS capability of Provisioned
IOPS or General Purpose (SSD) storage.

You can use CloudFormation to restore a DB instance from a DB instance snapshot. For more information,
see [AWS::RDS::DBInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-rds-dbinstance.html)
in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

###### Note

You can't restore a DB instance from a DB snapshot that is both shared and encrypted. Instead, you can make
a copy of the DB snapshot and restore the DB instance from the copy. For more information, see
[Copying a DB snapshot for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CopySnapshot.html).

For information about restoring a DB instance with an RDS Extended Support version, see [Restoring a DB instance or a Multi-AZ DB cluster with Amazon RDS Extended Support](extended-support-restoring-db-instance.md).

## Restoring from a snapshot

You can restore a DB instance from a DB snapshot using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

###### Note

You can't reduce the amount of storage when you restore a DB instance. When you increase the allocated storage, it
must be by at least 10 percent. If you try to increase the value by less than 10 percent, you get an error. You can't
increase the allocated storage when restoring RDS for SQL Server DB instances.

###### To restore a DB instance from a DB snapshot

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Snapshots**.

3. Choose the DB snapshot that you want to restore from.

4. For **Actions**, choose **Restore snapshot**.

5. On the **Restore snapshot** page, for **DB instance identifier**,
    enter the name for your restored DB instance.

6. Specify other settings, such as allocated storage size.

For information about each setting, see [Settings for DB instances](user-createdbinstance-settings.md).

7. Choose **Restore DB instance**.

To restore a DB instance from a DB snapshot, use the AWS CLI command
[restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot.html).

In this example, you restore from a previously created DB snapshot named `mydbsnapshot`. You restore to a new DB instance
named `mynewdbinstance`. This example also sets the allocated storage size.

You can specify other settings. For information about each setting, see [Settings for DB instances](user-createdbinstance-settings.md).

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot \
    --db-instance-identifier mynewdbinstance \
    --db-snapshot-identifier mydbsnapshot \
    --allocated-storage 100
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot ^
    --db-instance-identifier mynewdbinstance ^
    --db-snapshot-identifier mydbsnapshot ^
    --allocated-storage 100
```

This command returns output similar to the following:

```

DBINSTANCE  mynewdbinstance  db.t3.small  MySQL     50       sa              creating  3  n  8.0.28  general-public-license
```

###### Example

The following example shows restoring a snapshot while adding an
additional storage volume to the newly created instance. The
snapshot included additional volume `rdsdbdata2`. The restore
operation adds `rdsdbdata3`, making a total of three volumes in
the newly created instance. You can't delete a volume when you restore the
snapshot.

```

aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot \
     --db-instance-identifier my-restored-instance \
     --db-snapshot-identifier my-asv-snapshot \
     --additional-storage-volumes '[{ \
             "VolumeName": "rdsdbdata3", \
             "StorageType":"gp3", \
             "AllocatedStorage": 5000, \
             "IOPS": 12000 \
         }]'
```

To restore a DB instance from a DB snapshot, call the Amazon RDS API function
[RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-restoredbinstancefromdbsnapshot.md)
with the following parameters:

- `DBInstanceIdentifier`

- `DBSnapshotIdentifier`

## Considerations

For considerations when restoring to a DB instance from a DB snapshot, see the following topics.

###### Topics

- [Parameter group considerations](#USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.Parameters)

- [Security group considerations](#USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.Security)

- [Option group considerations](#USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.Options)

- [Resource tagging considerations](#restore-from-snapshot.tagging)

- [Db2 considerations](#USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.Db2)

- [Microsoft SQL Server considerations](#USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.MSSQL)

- [MySQL considerations](#USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.MySQL)

- [Oracle Database considerations](#USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.Oracle)

### Parameter group considerations

We recommend that you retain the DB parameter group for any DB snapshots you create, so that you can associate
your restored DB instance with the correct parameter group.

The default DB parameter group is associated with the restored instance, unless you choose a different
one. No custom parameter settings are available in the default parameter group.

You can specify the parameter group when you restore the DB instance.

For more information about DB parameter groups, see
[Parameter groups for Amazon RDS](user-workingwithparamgroups.md).

### Security group considerations

When you restore a DB instance, the default
virtual private cloud (VPC), DB subnet group, and VPC security group are associated with the restored instance, unless you
choose different ones.

- If you're using the Amazon RDS console, you can specify a custom VPC security group to associate with the instance
or create a new VPC security group.

- If you're using the AWS CLI, you can specify a custom VPC security group to associate with the
instance by including the `--vpc-security-group-ids` option in the
`restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot` command.

- If you're using the Amazon RDS API, you can include the `VpcSecurityGroupIds.VpcSecurityGroupId.N` parameter in
the `RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot` action.

As soon as the restore is complete and your new DB instance is available, you can also change the VPC
settings by modifying the DB instance. For more information, see
[Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

### Option group considerations

When you restore a DB instance, the default DB option group is associated with the restored DB instance in most cases.

The exception is when the source DB instance is associated with an option group that contains a persistent or permanent
option. For example, if the source DB instance uses Oracle Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), the restored DB instance must use
an option group that has the TDE option.

If you restore a DB instance into a different VPC, you must do one of the following to assign a DB option group:

- Assign the default option group for that VPC group to the instance.

- Assign another option group that is linked to that VPC.

- Create a new option group and assign it to the DB instance. With persistent or permanent options, such as Oracle TDE,
you must create a new option group that includes the persistent or permanent option.

For more information about DB option groups, see [Working with option groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.html).

### Resource tagging considerations

When you restore a DB instance from a DB snapshot, RDS checks whether you specify new tags. If yes, the new tags are added to
the restored DB instance. If there are no new tags, RDS adds the tags from the source DB instance at the time of snapshot
creation to the restored DB instance.

For more information, see [Copying tags to DB snapshots](user-tagging.md#USER_Tagging.CopyTags).

### Db2 considerations

With the BYOL model, your Amazon RDS for Db2 DB instances must be associated with a custom
parameter group that contains your IBM Site ID and your IBM Customer ID. Otherwise, attempts to
restore a DB instance from a snapshot will fail. Your Amazon RDS for Db2 DB instances must
also be associated with an AWS License Manager self-managed license. For more information, see
[Bring your own license (BYOL) for Db2](db2-licensing.md#db2-licensing-options-byol).

With the Db2 license through AWS Marketplace model, you need an active AWS Marketplace subscription
for the particular IBM Db2 edition that you want to use. If you don't already have one,
[subscribe to Db2 in\
AWS Marketplace](db2-licensing.md#db2-marketplace-subscribing-registering) for that IBM Db2 edition. For more information, see [Db2 license through AWS Marketplace](db2-licensing.md#db2-licensing-options-marketplace).

### Microsoft SQL Server considerations

When you restore an RDS for Microsoft SQL Server DB snapshot to a new instance, you can always restore to the same edition as your snapshot. In some
cases, you can also change the edition of the DB instance. The following limitations apply when you change editions:

- The DB snapshot must have enough storage allocated for the new edition.

- Only the following edition changes are supported:

- From Standard Edition to Enterprise Edition

- From Web Edition to Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition

- From Express Edition to Web Edition, Standard Edition, or Enterprise Edition

If you want to change from one edition to a new edition that isn't supported by
restoring a snapshot, you can try using the native backup and restore feature. SQL
Server verifies whether your database is compatible with the new edition based on what
SQL Server features you have enabled on the database. For more information, see
[Importing and exporting SQL Server databases using native backup and restore](sqlserver-procedural-importing.md).

### MySQL considerations

To restore from a RDS for MySQL DB snapshot with an unsupported engine version, you might have to upgrade your DB snapshot more than once. For more information about upgrade options, see [Upgrade options for DB snapshots with unsupported engine versions for RDS for MySQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/mysql-upgrade-snapshot.upgrade-options.html).

For more information about upgrading the engine version of a RDS for MySQL DB snapshot, [Upgrading a MySQL DB snapshot engine version](mysql-upgrade-snapshot.md).

### Oracle Database considerations

When you restore an Oracle database from a DB snapshot, consider the following:

- Before you restore a DB snapshot, you can upgrade it to a later Oracle
database release. For more information, see [Upgrading an Oracle DB snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBSnapshot.Oracle.html).

- If you restore a snapshot of a CDB instance that uses the single-tenant configuration, you
can change the PDB name. You can't change the PDB names when your CDB instance
uses the multi-tenant configuration. For more information, see [Backing up and restoring a CDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Oracle.Concepts.single-tenant.snapshots.html).

- You can't change the CDB name, which is always `RDSCDB`. This CDB
name is the same for all CDB instances.

- You can't directly interact with the tenant databases in a DB snapshot. If you restore a
snapshot of a CDB instance that uses the multi-tenant configuration, you restore
all its tenant databases. You can use [describe-db-snapshot-tenant-databases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-snapshot-tenant-databases.html) to inspect the tenant
databases within a DB snapshot before restoring it.

- If you use Oracle GoldenGate, always retain the parameter group with the
`compatible` parameter. When you restore a DB instance from a DB
snapshot, specify a parameter group that has a matching or greater
`compatible` value.

- You might choose to rename your database when you restore a DB snapshot. If the
total size of online redo log is greater than 20GB, RDS might reset your online
redo log size to its default settings of 512MB (4 x 128MB). The smaller size
allows the restore operation to complete in a reasonable time. You can re-create
the online redo logs later and change the size.

- You can manage your master user password in AWS Secrets Manager. For more information, see [Overview of managing master user passwords with AWS Secrets Manager](rds-secrets-manager.md#rds-secrets-manager-overview).
