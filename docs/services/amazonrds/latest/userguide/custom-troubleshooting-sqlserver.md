# Troubleshooting DB issues for Amazon RDS Custom for SQL Server

The shared responsibility model of RDS Custom provides OS shell–level access and
database administrator access. RDS Custom runs resources in your account, unlike Amazon RDS, which
runs resources in a system account. With greater access comes greater responsibility. In the
following sections, you can learn how to troubleshoot issues with Amazon RDS Custom for SQL Server DB
instances.

###### Note

This section explains how to troubleshoot RDS Custom for SQL Server. For troubleshooting RDS Custom for Oracle, see
[Troubleshooting DB issues for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle](custom-troubleshooting.md).

## Viewing RDS Custom events

The procedure for viewing events is the same for RDS Custom and Amazon RDS DB instances. For more information, see [Viewing Amazon RDS events](user-listevents.md).

To view RDS Custom event notification using the AWS CLI, use the `describe-events` command. RDS Custom introduces several new
events. The event categories are the same as for Amazon RDS. For the list of events, see [Amazon RDS event categories and event messages](user-events-messages.md).

The following example retrieves details for the events that have occurred for the specified RDS Custom DB instance.

```

aws rds describe-events \
    --source-identifier my-custom-instance \
    --source-type db-instance
```

## Subscribing to RDS Custom events

The procedure for subscribing to events is the same for RDS Custom and Amazon RDS DB instances. For more information, see [Subscribing to Amazon RDS event notification](user-events-subscribing.md).

To subscribe to RDS Custom event notification using the CLI, use the `create-event-subscription` command. Include the
following required parameters:

- `--subscription-name`

- `--sns-topic-arn`

The following example creates a subscription for backup and recovery events for an RDS Custom DB instance in the current AWS
account. Notifications are sent to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic, specified by `--sns-topic-arn`.

```

aws rds create-event-subscription \
    --subscription-name my-instance-events \
    --source-type db-instance \
    --event-categories '["backup","recovery"]' \
    --sns-topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:interesting-events
```

## Troubleshooting CEV errors for RDS Custom for SQL Server

When you try to create a CEV, it might fail. In this case, RDS Custom issues the
`RDS-EVENT-0198` event message. For more information on viewing RDS events,
see [Amazon RDS event categories and event messages](user-events-messages.md).

Use the following information to help you address possible causes.

MessageTroubleshooting suggestions

`Custom Engine Version creation expected a Sysprep’d AMI. Retry creation using a Sysprep’d AMI.`

Run Sysprep on the EC2 instance that you created from the AMI. For more information about
prepping an AMI using Sysprep, see [Create a standardized Amazon Machine Image (AMI) using\
Sysprep](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/Creating_EBSbacked_WinAMI.html#sysprep-using-ec2launchv2).

`EC2 Image permissions for image (AMI_ID) weren't found for customer (Customer_ID). Verify customer (Customer_ID) has valid permissions on the EC2 Image.`

Verify that your account and profile used for creation has the required permissions on `create EC2 Instance` and `Describe Images` for the selected AMI.

`Failed to rebuild databases with server collation (collation name) due to missing setup.exe file for SQL Server.`

Verify that the `setup` file is available at `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\nnn\Setup Bootstrap\SQLnnnn\setup.exe`.

`Image (AMI_ID) doesn't exist in your account (ACCOUNT_ID). Verify (ACCOUNT_ID) is the owner of the EC2 image.`

Ensure the AMI exists in the same customer account.

`Image id (AMI_ID) isn't valid. Specify a valid image id, and try again.`

The name of the AMI is incorrect. Ensure the correct AMI ID is provided.

`Image (AMI_ID) operating system platform isn't supported. Specify a valid image, and try again.`

Choose a supported AMI that has Windows Server with SQL Server Enterprise, Standard, or Web edition. Choose an AMI with one of the following usage operation codes from
the EC2 Marketplace:

- RunInstances:0102 - Windows with SQL Server Enterprise

- RunInstances:0006 - Windows with SQL Server Standard

- RunInstances:0202 - Windows with SQL Server Web

`SQL Server Web Edition isn't supported for creating a Custom Engine Version using Bring Your Own Media. Specify a valid image, and try again.`

Use an AMI that contains a supported edition of SQL Server. For more information, see [Version support for RDS Custom for SQL Server CEVs](custom-cev-sqlserver-preparing.md#custom-cev-sqlserver.preparing.VersionSupport).

`The custom engine version can't be the same as the OEV engine version. Specify a valid CEV, and try again.`

Classic RDS Custom for SQL Server engine versions aren't supported. For example, version
**15.00.4073.23.v1**. Use a supported version
number.

`The custom engine version isn't in an active state. Specify a valid CEV, and try again.`

The CEV must be in an `AVAILABLE` state to complete the operation. Modify the CEV from `INACTIVE` to `AVAILABLE`.

`The custom engine version isn't valid for an upgrade. Specify a valid CEV with an engine version greater or equal to (X), and try again.`

The target CEV is not valid. Check the requirements for a valid upgrade path.

`The custom engine version isn't valid. Names can include only lowercase letters (a-z), dashes (-), underscores (_), and periods (.).
                        Specify a valid CEV, and try again.`

Follow the required CEV naming convention. For more information, see
[Requirements for RDS Custom for SQL Server CEVs](custom-cev-sqlserver-preparing.md#custom-cev-sqlserver.preparing.Requirements).

`The custom engine version isn't valid. Specify valid database engine version, and try again. Example: 15.00.4073.23-cev123.`

An unsupported DB engine version was provided. Use a supported DB engine version.

`The expected architecture is (X) for image (AMI_ID), but architecture (Y) was found.`

Use an AMI built on the **x86\_64** architecture.

`The expected owner of image (AMI_ID) is customer account ID (ACCOUNT_ID), but owner (ACCOUNT_ID) was found.`

Create the EC2 instance from the AMI that you have permission for. Run Sysprep on the EC2
instance to create and save a base image.

`The expected platform is (X) for image (AMI_ID), but platform (Y) was found.`

Use an AMI built with the Windows platform.

`The expected root device type is (X) for image %s, but root device type (Y) was found.`

Create the AMI with the EBS device type.

`The expected SQL Server edition is (X), but (Y) was found.`

Choose a supported AMI that has Windows Server with SQL Server Enterprise, Standard, or Web edition. Choose an AMI with one of the following usage operation codes
from the EC2 Marketplace:

- RunInstances:0102 - Windows with SQL Server Enterprise

- RunInstances:0006 - Windows with SQL Server Standard

- RunInstances:0202 - Windows with SQL Server Web

`The expected state is (X) for image (AMI_ID), but the following state was found: (Y).`

Ensure the AMI is in a state of `AVAILABLE`.

`The provided Windows OS name (X) isn’t valid. Make sure the OS is one of the following: (Y).`

Use a supported Windows OS.

`Unable to find bootstrap log file in path.`

Verify that the log file is available at `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\nnn\Setup Bootstrap\Log\Summary.txt`.

`RDS expected a Windows build version greater than or equal to (X), but found version (Y).`.

Use an AMI with a minimum OS build version of **14393**.

`RDS expected a Windows major version greater than or equal to (X), but found version (Y).`.

Use an AMI with a minimum OS major version of **10.0** or higher.

## Fixing unsupported configurations in RDS Custom for SQL Server

Because of the shared responsibility model, it's your responsibility to fix configuration
issues that put your RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance into the `unsupported-configuration` state.
If the issue is with the AWS infrastructure, you can use the console or the AWS CLI to fix
it. If the issue is with the operating system or the database configuration, you can log in
to the host to fix it.

###### Note

This section explains how to fix unsupported configurations in RDS Custom for SQL Server. For
information about RDS Custom for Oracle, see [Fixing unsupported configurations in RDS Custom for Oracle](custom-troubleshooting.md#custom-troubleshooting.fix-unsupported).

In the following tables, you can find descriptions of the notifications and events that
the support perimeter sends and how to fix them. These notifications and the support
perimeter are subject to change. For background on the support perimeter, see [RDS Custom support perimeter](custom-concept.md#custom-troubleshooting.support-perimeter). For event descriptions, see
[Amazon RDS event categories and event messages](user-events-messages.md).

**change the SQL Server version on the RDS Custom EC2 instance. To resolve**
**this issue, create a support case. For any future modifications to**
**SQL Server version, you can modify the instance from the AWS RDS**
**console or through the modify-db-instance CLI**
**command.`**

Run the following query to get the SQL version:

###### Example

```sql

select @@version
```

Run the following AWS CLI command to get the RDS SQL engine
version:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances \
--db-instance-identifier db-instance-name |grep EngineVersion
```

For more information, see [Modifying an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-managing.modify-sqlserver.html) and [Upgrading a DB instance engine version](user-upgradedbinstance-upgrading.md).

`SP-S3007`

Database file location

**`The RDS Custom DB instance status is set to [Unsupported**
**configuration] because of: Database files are configured outside of**
**the D:\ drive. You can resolve this by making sure that all database**
**files, including ROW, LOG, FILESTREAM, etc... are stored on the D:\**
**drive.`**

Run the following query to list the location of database files
that aren't in the default path:

```sql

USE master;
SELECT physical_name as  files_not_in_default_path
FROM sys.master_files
WHERE SUBSTRING(physical_name,1,3)!='D:\';

```

`SP-S3008`

Database Count Limit Exceeded

**`The RDS Custom DB instance status is set to [Unsupported**
**configuration] because of: The total number of databases on the DB instance**
**exceeds the maximum limit of 5000. To resolve this, reduce the number of**
**databases below the maximum supported limit.`**

Use the following command to view total database count:

```sql

SELECT COUNT(name) as databaseCount
FROM sys.databases
WHERE name not in ('tempdb','master','model','msdb','DWDiagnostics','DWConfiguration','DWQueue');
```

## Troubleshooting `Storage-Full` in RDS Custom for SQL Server

RDS Custom also monitors the root (C:) volume. The RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance moves to the
`unsupported-configuration` state when the root
volume has less than 500 MiB disk space available. See `Event SP-S2010` in
[Fixing unsupported configurations in RDS Custom for SQL Server](#custom-troubleshooting-sqlserver.fix-unsupported).

## Troubleshooting PENDING\_RECOVERY state for TDE enabled databases in RDS Custom for SQL Server

SQL Server databases with transparent data encryption (TDE) enabled might remain in
`PENDING_RECOVERY` state if the automatic decryption runs into issues.
This typically occurs after a DB instance restore if the source DB instance Service Master Key (SMK) backup file
stored in the RDS Custom managed S3 bucket in your account has been deleted prior to the restore completion.

To enable the automatic decryption and bring the TDE enabled databases online,
you need to open the Database Master Key (DMK) with its password and ecrypt the DMK using the SMK.

Use the following SQL Server commands for reference:

```

-- Identify PENDING_RECOVERY TDE databases
USE MASTER;
GO
SELECT name, is_encrypted, state_desc FROM sys.databases;
GO

-- Open DMK using password
OPEN MASTER KEY DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '<password>';
GO

-- Encrypt DMK using SMK
ALTER MASTER KEY ADD ENCRYPTION BY SERVICE MASTER KEY;
GO

-- Close SMK
CLOSE MASTER KEY;
GO

-- Bring the TDE databases online
ALTER DATABASE <database_name> SET ONLINE;
GO

-- Verify TDE databases are now in ONLINE state
SELECT name, is_encrypted, state_desc FROM sys.databases;
GO
```
