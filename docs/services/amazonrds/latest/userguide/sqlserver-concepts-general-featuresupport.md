## Microsoft SQL Server 2022 features

SQL Server 2022 includes many new features, such as the following:

- Parameter Sensitive Plan Optimization – allows multiple cached plans for a single parameterized statement,
potentially reducing issues with parameter sniffing.

- SQL Server Ledger – provides the ability to cryptographically prove that your data hasn't been altered without authorization.

- Instant file initialization for transaction log file growth events – results in faster execution of log growth events up to 64MB,
including for databases with TDE enabled.

- System page latch concurrency enhancements – reduces page latch contention while allocating and deallocating data pages and extents,
providing significant performance enhancements to `tempdb` heavy workloads.

For the full list of SQL Server 2022 features, see [What's new in SQL Server 2022 (16.x)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/what-s-new-in-sql-server-2022?view=sql-server-ver16) in the Microsoft
documentation.

For a list of unsupported features, see [Features not supported and features with limited support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.Concepts.General.FeatureNonSupport.html).

## Microsoft SQL Server 2019 features

SQL Server 2019 includes many new features, such as the following:

- Accelerated database recovery (ADR) – Reduces crash recovery time after a restart or a
long-running transaction rollback.

- Intelligent Query Processing (IQP):

- Row mode memory grant feedback – Corrects excessive grants automatically, that
would otherwise result in wasted memory and reduced
concurrency.

- Batch mode on rowstore – Enables batch mode execution for analytic
workloads without requiring columnstore indexes.

- Table variable deferred compilation – Improves plan quality and
overall performance for queries that reference table
variables.

- Intelligent performance:

- `OPTIMIZE_FOR_SEQUENTIAL_KEY` index option – Improves throughput for
high-concurrency inserts into indexes.

- Improved indirect checkpoint scalability – Helps databases with
heavy DML workloads.

- Concurrent Page Free Space (PFS) updates – Enables handling as a shared latch
rather than an exclusive latch.

- Monitoring improvements:

- `WAIT_ON_SYNC_STATISTICS_REFRESH` wait type – Shows accumulated
instance-level time spent on synchronous statistics refresh
operations.

- Database-scoped configurations – Include
`LIGHTWEIGHT_QUERY_PROFILING` and
`LAST_QUERY_PLAN_STATS`.

- Dynamic management functions (DMFs) – Include
`sys.dm_exec_query_plan_stats` and
`sys.dm_db_page_info`.

- Verbose truncation warnings – The data truncation error message defaults to
include table and column names and the truncated value.

- Resumable online index creation – In SQL Server 2017, only resumable online
index rebuild is supported.
