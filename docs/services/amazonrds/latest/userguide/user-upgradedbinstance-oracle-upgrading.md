# Upgrading the version of an RDS for Oracle DB instance

To manually upgrade the DB engine version of an RDS for Oracle DB instance,use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI,
or the RDS API. For general information about database upgrades in RDS, see Upgrading the version of an RDS for Oracle DB instance. To get valid upgrade targets,
use the AWS CLI [describe-db-engine-versions](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-engine-versions.md) command.

###### To upgrade the engine version of an RDS for Oracle DB instance by using the console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then
    choose the DB instance that you want to upgrade.

3. Choose **Modify**.

4. For **DB engine version**, choose a higher database
    version.

5. Choose **Continue** and check the summary of
    modifications. Make sure that you understand the implications of a database
    version upgrade. You can't convert an upgraded DB instance back to the previous
    version. Make sure you have tested both your database and your application
    with the new version before continuing.

6. Decide when to schedule your DB instance upgrade. To apply the changes
    immediately, choose **Apply immediately**. Choosing this
    option can cause an outage in some cases. For more information, see [Using the schedule modifications setting](user-modifyinstance-applyimmediately.md).

7. On the confirmation page, review your changes. If they are correct, choose
    **Modify DB instance** to save your changes.

Alternatively, choose **Back** to edit your changes, or
    choose **Cancel** to cancel your changes.

To upgrade the engine version of an RDS for Oracle DB instance, you can use the CLI [modify-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.md)
command. Specify the following parameters:

- `--db-instance-identifier` – the name of the RDS for Oracle
DB instance.

- `--engine-version` – the version number of the database
engine to upgrade to.

For information about valid engine versions, use the AWS CLI [describe-db-engine-versions](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-engine-versions.md) command.

- `--allow-major-version-upgrade` – to upgrade the DB engine
version.

- `--no-apply-immediately` – to apply changes during the
next maintenance window. To apply changes immediately, use
`--apply-immediately`.

###### Example

The following example upgrades a CDB instance named `myorainst`
from its current version of `19.0.0.0.ru-2024-01.rur-2024-01.r1` to
version `21.0.0.0.ru-2024-04.rur-2024-04.r1`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier myorainst \
    --engine-version 21.0.0.0.ru-2024-04.rur-2024-04.r1 \
    --allow-major-version-upgrade \
    --no-apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier myorainst ^
    --engine-version 21.0.0.0.ru-2024-04.rur-2024-04.r1 ^
    --allow-major-version-upgrade ^
    --no-apply-immediately
```

To upgrade an RDS for Oracle DB instance, use the [ModifyDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbinstance.md) action.
Specify the following parameters:

- `DBInstanceIdentifier` – the name of the DB instance, for
example `myorainst`.

- `EngineVersion` – the version number of the database
engine to upgrade to. For information about valid engine versions, use the
[DescribeDBEngineVersions](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbengineversions.md) operation.

- `AllowMajorVersionUpgrade` – whether to allow a major
version upgrade. To do so, set the value to `true`.

- `ApplyImmediately` – whether to apply changes
immediately or during the next maintenance window. To apply changes
immediately, set the value to `true`. To apply changes during the
next maintenance window, set the value to `false`.
