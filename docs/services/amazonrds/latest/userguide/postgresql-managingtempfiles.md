# Managing temporary files with PostgreSQL

In PostgreSQL, a complex query might perform several sort or hash operations at the same
time, with each operation using instance memory to store results up to the value specified
in the [`work_mem`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html) parameter. When the instance memory is not
sufficient, temporary files are created to store the results. These are written to disk to
complete the query execution. Later, these files are automatically removed after the query
completes. In RDS for PostgreSQL, these files are stored in Amazon EBS
on the data volume. For more information, see [Amazon RDS DB instance\
storage](chap-storage.md). You can monitor the `FreeStorageSpace` metric published
in CloudWatch to make sure that your DB instance has enough free storage space. For more
information, see [`FreeStorageSpace `](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/storage-full-rds-cloudwatch-alarm).

We recommend using Amazon RDS Optimized Read instances for workloads involving multiple concurrent queries
that increase the usage of temporary files. These instances use local Non-Volatile
Memory Express (NVMe) based solid state drive (SSD) block-level storage to place the
temporary files. For more information, see [Improving query performance for RDS for PostgreSQL with Amazon RDS Optimized Reads](user-postgresql-optimizedreads.md).

You can use the following parameters and functions to manage the temporary files in your
instance.

- [`temp_file_limit`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html) – This parameter
cancels any query exceeding the size of temp\_files in KB. This limit prevents any
query from running endlessly and consuming disk space with temporary files. You can
estimate the value using the results from the `log_temp_files` parameter.
As a best practice, examine the workload behavior and set the limit according to the
estimation. The following example shows how a query is canceled when it exceeds the
limit.

```nohighlight

postgres=>select * from pgbench_accounts, pg_class, big_table;

```

```nohighlight

ERROR: temporary file size exceeds temp_file_limit (64kB)

```

- [`log_temp_files`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html) – This parameter sends
messages to the postgresql.log when the temporary files of a session are removed.
This parameter produces logs after a query successfully completes. Therefore, it
might not help in troubleshooting active, long-running queries.

The following example shows that when the query successfully completes, the
entries are logged in the postgresql.log file while the temporary files are cleaned
up.

```nohighlight

2023-02-06 23:48:35 UTC:205.251.233.182(12456):adminuser@postgres:[31236]:STATEMENT:  select a.aid from pgbench_accounts a, pgbench_accounts b where a.bid=b.bid order by a.bid limit 10;

```

- [`pg_ls_tmpdir`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html) – This function that is
available from RDS for PostgreSQL 13 and above provides visibility into the current
temporary file usage. The completed query doesn't appear in the results of the
function. In the following example, you can view the results of this
function.

```nohighlight

postgres=>select * from pg_ls_tmpdir();

```

```nohighlight

        name       |    size    |      modification
  -----------------+------------+------------------------
pgsql_tmp8355.1 | 1072250880 | 2023-02-06 22:54:56+00
pgsql_tmp8351.0 | 1072250880 | 2023-02-06 22:54:43+00
pgsql_tmp8327.0 | 1072250880 | 2023-02-06 22:54:56+00
pgsql_tmp8351.1 |  703168512 | 2023-02-06 22:54:56+00
pgsql_tmp8355.0 | 1072250880 | 2023-02-06 22:54:00+00
pgsql_tmp8328.1 |  835031040 | 2023-02-06 22:54:56+00
pgsql_tmp8328.0 | 1072250880 | 2023-02-06 22:54:40+00
(7 rows)
```

```nohighlight

postgres=>select query from pg_stat_activity where pid = 8355;

query
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
select a.aid from pgbench_accounts a, pgbench_accounts b where a.bid=b.bid order by a.bid
(1 row)
```

The file name includes the processing ID (PID) of the session that generated the
temporary file. A more advanced query, such as in the following example, performs a
sum of the temporary files for each PID.

```nohighlight

postgres=>select replace(left(name, strpos(name, '.')-1),'pgsql_tmp','') as pid, count(*), sum(size) from pg_ls_tmpdir() group by pid;

```

```nohighlight

pid  | count |   sum
  ------+-------------------
8355 |     2 | 2144501760
8351 |     2 | 2090770432
8327 |     1 | 1072250880
8328 |     2 | 2144501760
(4 rows)
```

- `
                              pg_stat_statements` – If you activate the
pg\_stat\_statements parameter, then you can view the average temporary file usage per
call. You can identify the query\_id of the query and use it to examine the temporary
file usage as shown in the following example.

```nohighlight

postgres=>select queryid from pg_stat_statements where query like 'select a.aid from pgbench%';

```

```nohighlight

         queryid
  ----------------------
   -7170349228837045701
(1 row)

```

```nohighlight

postgres=>select queryid, substr(query,1,25), calls, temp_blks_read/calls temp_blks_read_per_call, temp_blks_written/calls temp_blks_written_per_call from pg_stat_statements where queryid = -7170349228837045701;

```

```nohighlight

         queryid        |          substr           | calls | temp_blks_read_per_call | temp_blks_written_per_call
  ----------------------+---------------------------+-------+-------------------------+----------------------------
   -7170349228837045701 | select a.aid from pgbench |    50 |                  239226 |                     388678
(1 row)

```

- `Performance
                              Insights` – In the Performance Insights
dashboard, you can view temporary file usage by turning on the metrics
**temp\_bytes** and **temp\_files**. Then, you
can see the average of both of these metrics and see how they correspond to the
query workload. The view within Performance Insights doesn't show specifically
the queries that are generating the temporary files. However, when you combine
Performance Insights with the query shown for `pg_ls_tmpdir`, you can
troubleshoot, analyze, and determine the changes in your query workload.

Insights, see [Analyzing metrics with the Performance Insights dashboard](user-perfinsights-usingdashboard.md).
