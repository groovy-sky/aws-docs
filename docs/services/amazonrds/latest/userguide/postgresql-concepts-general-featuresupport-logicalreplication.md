# Performing logical replication for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL

Starting with version 10.4, RDS for PostgreSQL supports the publication and subscription SQL
syntax that was introduced in PostgreSQL 10. To learn more, see [Logical\
replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

###### Note

In addition to the native PostgreSQL logical replication feature introduced in
PostgreSQL 10, RDS for PostgreSQL also supports the `pglogical` extension. For
more information, see [Using pglogical to synchronize data across instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.pglogical.html).

Following, you can find information about setting up logical replication for an
RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance.

## Understanding logical replication and logical decoding

RDS for PostgreSQL supports the streaming of write-ahead log (WAL) changes using
PostgreSQL's logical replication slots. It also supports using logical decoding.
You can set up logical replication slots on your instance and stream database changes
through these slots to a client such as `pg_recvlogical`. You create logical
replication slots at the database level, and they support replication connections to a
single database.

The most common clients for PostgreSQL logical replication are AWS Database Migration Service or a
custom-managed host on an Amazon EC2 instance. The logical replication slot has no
information about the receiver of the stream. Also, there's no requirement that the
target be a replica database. If you set up a logical replication slot and don't
read from the slot, data can be written and quickly fill up your DB instance's
storage.

You turn on PostgreSQL logical replication and logical decoding for Amazon RDS with a
parameter, a replication connection type, and a security role. The client for logical
decoding can be any client that can establish a replication connection to a database on
a PostgreSQL DB instance.

###### To turn on logical decoding for an RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance

1. Make sure that the user account that you're using has these roles:

- The `rds_superuser` role so you can turn on logical
replication

- The `rds_replication` role to grant permissions to manage
logical slots and to stream data using logical slots

2. Set the `rds.logical_replication` static parameter to 1. As part of
    applying this parameter, also set the parameters `wal_level`,
    `max_wal_senders`, `max_replication_slots`, and
    `max_connections`. These parameter changes can increase WAL
    generation, so set the `rds.logical_replication` parameter only when
    you are using logical slots.

3. Reboot the DB instance for the static `rds.logical_replication`
    parameter to take effect.

4. Create a logical replication slot as explained in the next section. This
    process requires that you specify a decoding plugin. Currently, RDS for PostgreSQL
    supports the test\_decoding and wal2json output plugins that ship with
    PostgreSQL.

For more information on PostgreSQL logical decoding, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/logicaldecoding-explanation.html).

## Working with logical replication slots

You can use SQL commands to work with logical slots. For example, the following
command creates a logical slot named `test_slot` using the default PostgreSQL
output plugin `test_decoding`.

```sql

SELECT * FROM pg_create_logical_replication_slot('test_slot', 'test_decoding');
slot_name    | xlog_position
-----------------+---------------
regression_slot | 0/16B1970
(1 row)
```

To list logical slots, use the following command.

```sql

SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;
```

To drop a logical slot, use the following command.

```sql

SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('test_slot');
pg_drop_replication_slot
-----------------------
(1 row)
```

For more examples on working with logical replication slots, see [Logical decoding examples](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/logicaldecoding-example.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

After you create the logical replication slot, you can start streaming. The following
example shows how logical decoding is controlled over the streaming replication
protocol. This example uses the program pg\_recvlogical, which is included in the
PostgreSQL distribution. Doing this requires that client authentication is set up to
allow replication connections.

```nohighlight

pg_recvlogical -d postgres --slot test_slot -U postgres
    --host -instance-name.111122223333.aws-region.rds.amazonaws.com
    -f -  --start
```

To see the contents of the `pg_replication_origin_status` view, query the
`pg_show_replication_origin_status` function.

```sql

SELECT * FROM pg_show_replication_origin_status();
local_id | external_id | remote_lsn | local_lsn
----------+-------------+------------+-----------
(0 rows)
```

## Replicating table level data using logical replication

You can use logical replication to replicate data from source tables to target tables
in RDS for PostgreSQL. Logical replication first performs an initial load of existing data
from the source tables and then continues to replicate ongoing changes.

1. ###### Create the source tables

Connect to the source database in your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance:

```sql

source=> CREATE TABLE testtab (slno int primary key);
CREATE TABLE

```

2. ###### Insert data into the source tables

```sql

source=> INSERT INTO testtab VALUES (generate_series(1,1000));
INSERT 0 1000

```

3. ###### Create a publication for source tables

- Create a publication for the source tables:

```sql

source=> CREATE PUBLICATION testpub FOR TABLE testtab;
CREATE PUBLICATION

```

- Use a SELECT query to verify the details of the publication that was
created:

```sql

source=> SELECT * FROM pg_publication;
    oid   | pubname | pubowner | puballtables | pubinsert | pubupdate | pubdelete | pubtruncate | pubviaroot
  --------+---------+----------+--------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-------------+------------
115069 | testpub |    16395 | f            | t         | t         | t         | t           | f
(1 row)

```

- Verify that the source tables are added to the publication:

```sql

source=> SELECT * FROM pg_publication_tables;
pubname | schemaname | tablename
  ---------+------------+-----------
testpub | public     | testtab
(1 rows)

```

- To replicate all tables in a database, use:

```sql

CREATE PUBLICATION testpub FOR ALL TABLES;

```

- If the publication is already created for individual table and you
need to add new table, you can run below query to add any new tables
into the existing publication:

```sql

ALTER PUBLICATION <publication_name> add table <new_table_name>;

```

4. ###### Connect to target database and create target tables

- Connect to the target database in the target DB instance. Create the target
tables with the same names as the source tables:

```sql

target=> CREATE TABLE testtab (slno int primary key);
CREATE TABLE

```

- Make sure that there's no data present in the target tables by running
a SELECT query on the target tables:

```sql

target=> SELECT count(*) FROM testtab;
count
  -------
       0
(1 row)

```

5. ###### Create and verify subscription in target database

- Create the subscription in the target database:

```sql

target=> CREATE SUBSCRIPTION testsub
CONNECTION 'host=<source RDS/host endpoint> port=5432 dbname=<source_db_name> user=<user> password=<password>'
PUBLICATION testpub;
NOTICE:  Created replication slot "testsub" on publisher
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION

```

- Use a SELECT query to verify that the subscription is enabled:

```sql

target=> SELECT oid, subname, subenabled, subslotname, subpublications FROM pg_subscription;
    oid  | subname | subenabled | subslotname | subpublications
  -------+---------+------------+-------------+-----------------
16434 | testsub | t          | testsub     | {testpub}
(1 row)

```

- When the subscription is created, it loads all data from the source
tables to the target tables. Run a SELECT query on the target tables to
verify that the initial data loads:

```sql

target=> SELECT count(*) FROM testtab;
count
  -------
    1000
(1 row)

```

6. ###### Verify replication slot in source database

The creation of a subscription in the target database creates a replication
    slot in the source database. Verify the replication slot details by running the
    following SELECT query on the source database:

```sql

source=> SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;

slot_name |  plugin  | slot_type | datoid | database | temporary | active | active_pid | xmin | catalog_xmin | restart_lsn | confirmed_flush_lsn | wal_status | safe_wal_size
   ----------+----------+-----------+--------+----------+-----------+--------+------------+------+--------------+-------------+---------------------+------------+---------------
testsub   | pgoutput | logical   | 115048 | source   | f         | t      |        846 |      |         6945 | 58/B4000568 | 58/B40005A0         | reserved   |
(1 row)

```

7. ###### Testing replication

- Test whether data changes in the source tables are being replicated to
the target tables by inserting rows into the source tables:

```sql

source=> INSERT INTO testtab VALUES(generate_series(1001,2000));
INSERT 0 1000

source=> SELECT count(*) FROM testtab;
count
  -------
    2000
(1 row)

```

- Verify the number of rows in the target tables to confirm that new
inserts are being replicated:

```sql

target=> SELECT count(*) FROM testtab;
count
  -------
    2000
(1 row)

```

8. ###### Refreshing the subscription after adding tables

- When you add new tables to an existing publication, it is mandatory to
refresh the subscription for the changes to take effect:

```sql

ALTER SUBSCRIPTION <subscription_name> REFRESH PUBLICATION;

```

- This command fetches missing table information from the publisher and
starts replication for tables that were added to the subscribed-to
publications since the subscription was created or last
refreshed.
