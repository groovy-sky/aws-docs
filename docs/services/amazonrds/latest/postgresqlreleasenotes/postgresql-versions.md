# Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL updates

Amazon RDS supports DB instances running several versions of PostgreSQL. You can specify any
currently available PostgreSQL version when creating a new DB instance. You can specify the
major version (such as PostgreSQL 10) and any available minor version for the specified
major version. If no version is specified, Amazon RDS defaults to an available version, typically
the most recent version. If a major version is specified but a minor version isn't,
Amazon RDS defaults to a recent release of the major version that you specified.

To see a list of available versions, and also defaults for newly created DB instances, use
the [`describe-db-engine-versions`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-engine-versions.html) AWS CLI command. For example, to display
the default PostgreSQL engine version, use the following command.

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --default-only --engine postgres
```

To learn more about versioning policy for RDS for PostgreSQL, see [Amazon RDS FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/faqs). For more information about PostgreSQL versions, see
[Versioning Policy](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning) in
the PostgreSQL documentation.

Predefined roles and their privileges can't be changed. You can't drop, rename, or
modify privileges for these predefined roles. Attempting to modify a predefined role
results in an error.

for these predefined roles. Attempting to modify a predefined role results in an
error.

The logical apply worker mitigates the risk by temporarily switching the role from the subscription owner to the table owner during logical apply.

In the cases of potential security breaches, the fix will break your existing logical replication if any table in the subscription is owned by a regular user, and there are
security-restricted operations attached to the table via triggers or default expressions. We recommend that you carefully examine the operations attached to the table
if you notice the logical replication is broken after the upgrade. If all of the operations are as expected and you wish to revert the behavior of the logical replication so your application
can continue, you can do so by setting the new parameter `rds.run_logical_replication_as_subscription_owner` to true. Be aware that by doing so your logical replication will be
vulnerable to the aforementioned security risk again.

- Added `rds.run_logical_replication_as_subscription_owner` to the Amazon RDS parameter group.

publisher to subscriber. Specifically, it allows the customer to create a logical
slot on a source RDS database, take a snapshot, restore the snapshot to a new RDS
instance (target), and use the value of logical\_seed\_lsn() from the target instance
to advance the logical slot on the source instance in order to subscribe the target
to the source.

###### New features

- Starting in RDS for PostgreSQL versions 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21, some
connection slots are reserved for the new `rds_reserved` role, which is granted
to Amazon RDS administrative users. The number of reserved connection slots is determined by the
`rds.rds_reserved_connections` parameter . You may need to adjust the value of
the `max_connections` parameter to account for the number of Amazon RDS reserved
connection slots.

The `rds_reserved` role is a new predefined role created by
Amazon RDS. Predefined roles and their privileges can't be changed. You can't drop, rename, or
modify privileges for these predefined roles. Attempting to modify a predefined role results
in an error.

- Unblocked `ALTER TEMP TABLE` and `DROP TEMP TABLE` in Blue/Green
replication.

### PostgreSQL version 14.10-R2 on Amazon RDS

PostgreSQL version 14.10-R2 is now available on Amazon RDS. This release contains several fixes and improvements for PostgreSQL announced in the
[PostgreSQL 14.10 release](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.10).

###### New features and enhancements

- Fixed a crash in `CatalogCacheComputeHashValue` with `dblink_connect` due to a `Null` or `invalid` connection.

- Backported run\_as\_owner to RPG 14

- Backported a security fix for the logical replication apply worker that allows regular table owners to obtain privilege escalation to the subscription owner (an rds\_superuser).
The logical apply worker mitigates the risk by temporarily switching the role from the subscription owner to the table owner during logical apply.

In the cases of potential security breaches, the fix will break your existing logical replication if any table in the subscription is owned by a regular user, and there are
security-restricted operations attached to the table via triggers or default expressions. We recommend that you carefully examine the operations attached to the table
if you notice the logical replication is broken after the upgrade. If all of the operations are as expected and you wish to revert the behavior of the logical replication so your application
can continue, you can do so by setting the new parameter `rds.run_logical_replication_as_subscription_owner` to true. Be aware that by doing so your logical replication will be
vulnerable to the aforementioned security risk again.

- Added `rds.run_logical_replication_as_subscription_owner` to the Amazon RDS parameter group.

- Supported the AWS SDK version of the `aws_s3` extension.

- Fixed the overflow in the `pg_transport` extension.

- Removed the unsupported shared libraries from the engine binary.

### PostgreSQL version 14.8 on Amazon RDS (Deprecated)

PostgreSQL version 14.8 is now available on Amazon RDS. This release contains several fixes and
improvements for PostgreSQL announced in the [PostgreSQL 14.8\
release](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.8).

###### New features and enhancements

order to establish logical replication connection between the source and the
restored target database. You can then use logical replication to continuously
stream the newer data recorded after the LSN and synchronize the changes from
publisher to subscriber. Specifically, it allows the customer to create a logical
slot on a source RDS database, take a snapshot, restore the snapshot to a new RDS
instance (target), and use the value of logical\_seed\_lsn() from the target instance
to advance the logical slot on the source instance in order to subscribe the target
to the source.

This version also includes the following changes:

- `compat-collation-for-glibc` was updated to version 1.8.

### PostgreSQL version 14.7 on Amazon RDS (Deprecated)

PostgreSQL version 14.7 is now available on Amazon RDS. This release contains several fixes and
improvements for PostgreSQL announced in the [PostgreSQL 14.7\
release](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.7).

### PostgreSQL version 14.6 on Amazon RDS (Deprecated)

PostgreSQL version 14.6 is now available on Amazon RDS. This release contains several fixes and
improvements for PostgreSQL announced in the [PostgreSQL 14.6\
release](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.6).

###### New features and enhancements

- PostgreSQL version 14.6 added support for the `tcn` ("triggered change
notification") extension which generates notification events on table changes via a
trigger function called `triggered_change_notification`. The tcn
extension is useful for applications using drivers which support asynchronous
notification. This makes it possible to notify all clients if the contents of a
table have been changed, enabling them to take appropriate action in near-real time,
such as updating a table cache or information display.

However, such functionality should only be used with care as it makes all data
changes on the table available to all clients (including unprivileged users) through
the notification events when they listen on the tcn channel. It is the user’s
responsibility to avoid using tcn trigger on a table with sensitive data to avoid
information leakage.

This version includes the following changes:

- The `seg` extension version 1.4 was added.

- The `tcn` extension version 1.0 was added.

- The `orafce` extension was updated to version 3.24.

###### New features

- Starting in RDS for PostgreSQL versions 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21, some
connection slots are reserved for the new `rds_reserved` role, which is granted
to Amazon RDS administrative users. The number of reserved connection slots is determined by the
`rds.rds_reserved_connections` parameter . You may need to adjust the value of
the `max_connections` parameter to account for the number of Amazon RDS reserved
connection slots.

The `rds_reserved` role is a new predefined role created by Amazon RDS. Predefined
roles and their privileges can't be changed. You can't drop, rename, or modify privileges
for these predefined roles. Attempting to modify a predefined role results in an
error.

PostgreSQL version 13.13-R2 is now available on Amazon RDS. This release contains several fixes and improvements for PostgreSQL announced in the

###### New features and enhancements

- Fixed a crash in `CatalogCacheComputeHashValue` with `dblink_connect` due to a `Null` or `invalid` connection.

- Backported run\_as\_owner to RPG 13:

- Backported a security fix for the logical replication apply worker that allows regular table owners to obtain privilege escalation to the subscription owner (an rds\_superuser).
The logical apply worker mitigates the risk by temporarily switching the role from the subscription owner to the table owner during logical apply.

In the cases of potential security breaches, the fix will break your existing logical replication if any table in the subscription is owned by a regular user, and there are
security-restricted operations attached to the table via triggers or default expressions. We recommend that you carefully examine the operations attached to the table
if you notice the logical replication is broken after the upgrade. If all of the operations are as expected and you wish to revert the behavior of the logical replication so your application
can continue, you can do so by setting the new parameter `rds.run_logical_replication_as_subscription_owner` to true. Be aware that by doing so your logical replication will be
vulnerable to the aforementioned security risk again.

- Added `rds.run_logical_replication_as_subscription_owner` to the Amazon RDS parameter group.

- Fixed the overflow in the `pg_transport` extension.

- Removed the unsupported shared libraries from the engine binary.

- You can use logical\_seed\_lsn to determine the LSN at which a snapshot is taken in order to establish logical replication
connection between the source and the restored target database. You can then use logical replication to continuously stream the newer
data recorded after the LSN and synchronize the changes from publisher to subscriber. Specifically, it allows the customer to create a
logical slot on a source RDS database, take a snapshot, restore the snapshot to a new RDS instance (target), and use the value of
logical\_seed\_lsn() from the target instance to advance the logical slot on the source instance in order to subscribe the target to
the source.

### PostgreSQL version 13.9 on Amazon RDS (Deprecated)

PostgreSQL version 13.9 is now available on Amazon RDS. This release contains several fixes and
improvements for PostgreSQL announced in the [PostgreSQL 13.9\
release](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/13.9).

New features and enhancements

- PostgreSQL version 13.9 added support for the `tcn` ("triggered change
notification") extension which generates notification events on table changes via a
trigger function called `triggered_change_notification`. The tcn
extension is useful for applications using drivers which support asynchronous
notification. This makes it possible to notify all clients if the contents of a
table have been changed, enabling them to take appropriate action in near-real time,
such as updating a table cache or information display.

However, such functionality should only be used with care as it makes all data
changes on the table available to all clients (including unprivileged users) through
the notification events when they listen on the tcn channel. It is the user’s
responsibility to avoid using tcn trigger on a table with sensitive data to avoid
information leakage.

This version includes the following changes:

- The seg extension version 1.3 is added.

- The tcn extension version 1.0 is added.

- The orafce extension is updated to 3.24.

PostgreSQL version 12.21 is now available on Amazon RDS. This release contains several fixes and
improvements for PostgreSQL announced in [PostgreSQL 12.21](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/12.21).

###### New features

- Starting in RDS for PostgreSQL versions 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21, some
connection slots are reserved for the new `rds_reserved` role, which is granted
to Amazon RDS administrative users. The number of reserved connection slots is determined by the
`rds.rds_reserved_connections` parameter . You may need to adjust the value of
the `max_connections` parameter to account for the number of Amazon RDS reserved
connection slots.

The `rds_reserved` role is a new predefined role created by Amazon RDS. Predefined
roles and their privileges can't be changed. You can't drop, rename, or modify privileges
for these predefined roles. Attempting to modify a predefined role results in an
error.

- Unblocked `ALTER TEMP TABLE` and `DROP TEMP TABLE` in Blue/Green
replication.

### PostgreSQL version 12.17-R2 on Amazon RDS (Deprecated)

PostgreSQL version 12.17-R2 is now available on Amazon RDS. This release contains several fixes and improvements for PostgreSQL announced in the
[PostgreSQL 12.17 release](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/12.17).

###### New features and enhancements

- Fixed a crash in `CatalogCacheComputeHashValue` with `dblink_connect` due to a `Null` or `invalid` connection.

- Backported run\_as\_owner to RPG 12:

- Backported a security fix for the logical replication apply worker that allows regular table owners to obtain privilege escalation to the subscription owner (an rds\_superuser).
The logical apply worker mitigates the risk by temporarily switching the role from the subscription owner to the table owner during logical apply.

In the cases of potential security breaches, the fix will break your existing logical replication if any table in the subscription is owned by a regular user, and there are
security-restricted operations attached to the table via triggers or default expressions. We recommend that you carefully examine the operations attached to the table
if you notice the logical replication is broken after the upgrade. If all of the operations are as expected and you wish to revert the behavior of the logical replication so your application
can continue, you can do so by setting the new parameter `rds.run_logical_replication_as_subscription_owner` to true. Be aware that by doing so your logical replication will be
vulnerable to the aforementioned security risk again.

- Added `rds.run_logical_replication_as_subscription_owner` to the Amazon RDS parameter group.

- Fixed the overflow in the `pg_transport` extension.

- Removed the unsupported shared libraries from the engine binary.

access to restricted tables

- You can use logical\_seed\_lsn to determine the LSN at which a snapshot is taken in order to establish logical replication
connection between the source and the restored target database. You can then use logical replication to continuously stream the newer
data recorded after the LSN and synchronize the changes from publisher to subscriber. Specifically, it allows the customer to create a
logical slot on a source RDS database, take a snapshot, restore the snapshot to a new RDS instance (target), and use the value of
logical\_seed\_lsn() from the target instance to advance the logical slot on the source instance in order to subscribe the target to
the source.

This version also includes the following changes:

- `compat-collation-for-glibc` was updated to version 1.8

- `pg_cron` was updated to version 1.5.2

### PostgreSQL version 12.13 on Amazon RDS (Deprecated)

PostgreSQL version 12.13 is now available on Amazon RDS. This release contains several fixes
and improvements for PostgreSQL announced in the [PostgreSQL 12.13\
release](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/12.13).

New features and enhancements

- PostgreSQL version 12.13 added support for the `tcn` ("triggered change
notification") extension which generates notification events on table changes via a
trigger function called `triggered_change_notification`. The tcn
extension is useful for applications using drivers which support asynchronous
notification. This makes it possible to notify all clients if the contents of a
table have been changed, enabling them to take appropriate action in near-real time,
such as updating a table cache or information display.

However, such functionality should only be used with care as it makes all data
changes on the table available to all clients (including unprivileged users) through
the notification events when they listen on the tcn channel. It is the user’s
responsibility to avoid using tcn trigger on a table with sensitive data to avoid
information leakage.

This version includes the following changes:

- The seg extension version 1.3 is added.

- The tcn extension version 1.0 is added.

- The orafce extension is updated to 3.24.

### PostgreSQL version 11.22-R2 on Amazon RDS (This version has reached the end of standard support.)

PostgreSQL version 11.22-R2 is now available on Amazon RDS. This release contains
several fixes and improvements for PostgreSQL announced in the [PostgreSQL 11.22\
release](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/11.22).

###### New features and enhancements

- Backported run\_as\_owner to RPG 11:

- Backported a security fix for the logical replication apply
worker that allows regular table owners to obtain privilege
escalation to the subscription owner (an rds\_superuser). The logical
apply worker mitigates the risk by temporarily switching the role
from the subscription owner to the table owner during logical
apply.

In the cases of potential security breaches, the fix will break
your existing logical replication if any table in the subscription
is owned by a regular user, and there are security-restricted
operations attached to the table via triggers or default
expressions. We recommend that you carefully examine the operations
attached to the table if you notice the logical replication is
broken after the upgrade. If all of the operations are as expected
and you wish to revert the behavior of the logical replication so
your application can continue, you can do so by setting the new
parameter
`rds.run_logical_replication_as_subscription_owner`
to true. Be aware that by doing so your logical replication will be
vulnerable to the aforementioned security risk again.

- Added `rds.run_logical_replication_as_subscription_owner` to
the Amazon RDS parameter group.

- Fixed the overflow in the `pg_transport` extension.

- Removed the unsupported shared libraries from the engine binary.

### PostgreSQL version 11.22 on Amazon RDS (This version has reached the end of standard support.)

PostgreSQL version 11.22 is now available on Amazon RDS. This release contains several
fixes and improvements for PostgreSQL announced in the [PostgreSQL 11.22\
release](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/11.22).

###### New features and enhancements

- Fixed a bug where `pg_database_size()` with an invalid OID
causes a crash.

- Added support for the `rds.enable_pgactive` parameter in
rdsutils to avoid the warning message.

- Exposed RDKit guc param `rdkit.morgan_fp_size`.

- Fixed the bug where setting `TABLESPACE` with
`DEFAULT` option in `CREATE` or `ALTER
                              DATABASE` fails.

- Added the `pgactive` extension.

This version includes the following changes:

- The `hll` extension was updated to version 2.18

- The `pg_proctab` extension was updated to version
0.0.10.

- The `pgtap` extension was updated to version 1.3.1.

- The `plprofiler` extension was updated to version 4.2.4.

### PostgreSQL version 11.21 on Amazon RDS (Deprecated)

PostgreSQL version 11.21 is now available on Amazon RDS. This release contains several
fixes and improvements for PostgreSQL announced in the [PostgreSQL 11.21\
release](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/11.21).

###### New features and enhancements

from creating schemas in databases owned by other users.

in the `pg_toast schema` that are owned by other users.

### PostgreSQL version 11.20 on Amazon RDS (Deprecated)

PostgreSQL version 11.20 is now available on Amazon RDS. This release contains several
fixes and improvements for PostgreSQL announced in the [PostgreSQL 11.20\
release](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/11.20).

###### New features and enhancements

- Fixed a security issue involving `rds_sec_override` which
wasn't reset after the intended usage, allowing unauthorized access to
restricted tables

- You can use logical\_seed\_lsn to determine the LSN at which a snapshot is
taken in order to establish logical replication connection between the
source and the restored target database. You can then use logical
replication to continuously stream the newer data recorded after the LSN and
synchronize the changes from publisher to subscriber. Specifically, it
allows the customer to create a logical slot on a source RDS database, take
a snapshot, restore the snapshot to a new RDS instance (target), and use the
value of logical\_seed\_lsn() from the target instance to advance the logical
slot on the source instance in order to subscribe the target to the
source.

This version also includes the following changes:

- `compat-collation-for-glibc` was updated to version 1.8

- `pglogical` was updated to version 2.4.2

- `PostGIS` was updated to version 3.3.2

### PostgreSQL version 11.18 on Amazon RDS (Deprecated)

PostgreSQL version 11.18 is now available on Amazon RDS. This release contains several
fixes and improvements for PostgreSQL announced in the [PostgreSQL 11.18\
release](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/11.18).

New features and enhancements

- PostgreSQL version 11.18 added support for the `tcn`
("triggered change notification") extension which generates notification
events on table changes via a trigger function called
`triggered_change_notification`. The tcn extension is useful
for applications using drivers which support asynchronous notification. This
makes it possible to notify all clients if the contents of a table have been
changed, enabling them to take appropriate action in near-real time, such as
updating a table cache or information display.

However, such functionality should only be used with care as it makes all
data changes on the table available to all clients (including unprivileged
users) through the notification events when they listen on the tcn channel.
It is the user’s responsibility to avoid using tcn trigger on a table with
sensitive data to avoid information leakage.

This version includes the following changes:

- The seg extension version 1.3 is added.

- The tcn extension version 1.0 is added.

- The orafce extension is updated to 3.24.

### PostgreSQL version 11.1 on Amazon RDS (Deprecated)

PostgreSQL version 11.1 contains several improvements that were announced in
[PostgreSQL 11.1\
released!](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1905) This version includes SQL stored procedures that enable
embedded transactions within a procedure. This version also includes major
improvements to partitioning and parallelism and many useful performance
improvements. For example, by using a non-null constant for a column default, you
can now use an ALTER TABLE command to add a column without causing a table
rewrite.

PostgreSQL version 11.1 contains several bug fixes for issues in release 11. For
complete details, see the [PostgreSQL release\
11.1 documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/release-11-1.html). Some changes in this version include the
following:

- Partitioning – Partitioning improvements include support for hash
partitioning, enabling creation of a default partition, and dynamic row
movement to another partition based on the key column update.

- Performance – Performance improvements include parallelism while
creating indexes, materialized views, hash joins, and sequential scans to
make the operations perform better.

- Stored procedures – SQL stored procedures now added support
embedded transactions.

- Support for Just-In-Time (JIT) capability – RDS for PostgreSQL 11
instances are created with JIT capability, speeding evaluation of
expressions. To enable JIT capability, set the `jit` parameter to
1 in the PostgreSQL parameter group for the database.

- Segment size – The write-ahead logging (WAL) segment size has been
changed from 16 MB to 64 MB.

- Autovacuum improvements – To provide valuable logging, the
parameter `rds.force_autovacuum_logging` is ON by default in
conjunction with the `log_autovacuum_min_duration` parameter set
to 10 seconds. To increase autovacuum effectiveness, the values for the
`autovacuum_max_workers` and
`autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` parameters are computed based
on host memory capacity to provide larger default values.

- Improved transaction timeout – The parameter
`idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` is set to 24 hours. Any
session that has been idle more than 24 hours is terminated.

- Performance metrics – The `pg_stat_statements` extension
is included in `shared_preload_libraries` by default. This avoids
having to reboot the instance immediately after creation. However, this
functionality still requires you to run the statement `CREATE EXTENSION
                              pg_stat_statements;`. Also, `track_io_timing` is
enabled by default to add more granular data to
`pg_stat_statements`.

- The tsearch2 extension is no longer supported – If your application
uses `tsearch2` functions, update it to use the equivalent
functions provided by the core PostgreSQL engine. For more information about
the tsearch2 extension, see [PostgreSQL tsearch2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/tsearch2.html).

- The chkpass extension is no longer supported – For more information
about the `chkpass` extension, see [PostgreSQL\
chkpass](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/chkpass.html).

- Extension updates for RDS for PostgreSQL 11.1 include the following:

- `pgaudit` is updated to 1.3.0

- `pg_hint_plan` is updated to 1.3.2

- `pglogical` is updated to 2.2.1

- `plcoffee` is updated to 2.3.8

- `plv8` is updated to 2.3.8

- `PostGIS` is updated to 2.5.1

- `prefix` is updated to 1.2.8

- `wal2json` is updated to hash 9e962bad

### PostgreSQL version 10.23 on Amazon RDS (Deprecated)

PostgreSQL version 10.23 is now available on Amazon RDS. This release contains several
fixes and improvements for PostgreSQL announced in the [PostgreSQL 10.23\
release](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/10.23).

New features and enhancements

- PostgreSQL version 10.23 added support for the `tcn`
("triggered change notification") extension which generates notification
events on table changes via a trigger function called
`triggered_change_notification`. The tcn extension is useful
for applications using drivers which support asynchronous notification. This
makes it possible to notify all clients if the contents of a table have been
changed, enabling them to take appropriate action in near-real time, such as
updating a table cache or information display.

However, such functionality should only be used with care as it makes all
data changes on the table available to all clients (including unprivileged
users) through the notification events when they listen on the tcn channel.
It is the user’s responsibility to avoid using tcn trigger on a table with
sensitive data to avoid information leakage.

This version includes the following changes:

- The seg extension version 1.1 is added.

- The tcn extension version 1.0 is added.

- The orafce extension is updated to 3.24.

- The pgaudit extension is updated to 1.2.4.

password expiration changes. By restricting password-related operations to a
limited set of roles, you can implement policies such as password complexity
requirements from the client side. The
`rds.restrict_password_commands` parameter is static, so it
requires a database restart to change it. For more information, see [Restricting password management](../userguide/appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks.md#Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.RestrictPasswordMgmt) in the _Amazon RDS User_
_Guide_.

- The logical decoding plugin `wal2json` has been updated to
commit `9e962ba`.

more information on the fixes in 10.5, see the [PostgreSQL\
documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/release-10-5.html).

This version also includes the following changes:

- Support for the `pglogical` extension version 2.2.0.
Prerequisites for using this extension are the same as the prerequisites for
using logical replication for PostgreSQL as described in [Performing logical replication for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](../userguide/chap-postgresql.md#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.FeatureSupport.LogicalReplication) in the
_Amazon RDS User Guide_.

- Support for the `pg_similarity` extension version 1.0.

- Support for the `pageinspect` extension version 1.6.

- Support for the `libprotobuf` extension version 1.3.0 for the
PostGIS component.

documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/release-10-4.html).

This version also includes the following changes:

- Support for PostgreSQL 10 Logical Replication using the native publication
and subscription framework. RDS for PostgreSQL databases can function as both
publishers and subscribers. You can specify replication to other PostgreSQL
databases at the database-level or at the table-level. With logical
replication, the publisher and subscriber databases need not be physically
identical (block-to-block) to each other. This allows for use cases such as
data consolidation, data distribution, and data replication across different
database versions for 10.4 and above. For more information, see [Performing logical replication for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](../userguide/chap-postgresql.md#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.FeatureSupport.LogicalReplication) in the
_Amazon RDS User Guide_.

- The temporary file size limitation is user-configurable. You require the
**rds\_superuser** role to modify the
`temp_file_limit` parameter.

- Update of the `GDAL` library, which is used by the PostGIS
extension. See [Managing spatial data with the PostGIS extension](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.PostGIS.html) in the
_Amazon RDS User Guide_.

- Update of the `ip4r` extension to version 2.1.1.

- Update of the `pg_repack` extension to version 1.4.3. See
[Working with the pg\_repack extension](../userguide/appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks.md#Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.pg_repack) in the
_Amazon RDS User Guide_.

- Update of the `plv8` extension to version 2.1.2.

more information on the fixes in 10.3, see the [PostgreSQL\
documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/release-10-3.html).

Version 2.1.0 of plv8 is now available. If you use plv8 and upgrade PostgreSQL to
a new plv8 version, you immediately take advantage of the new extension but the
catalog metadata doesn't reflect this fact. For the steps to synchronize your
catalog metadata with the new version of plv8, see [Upgrading PLV8](../userguide/chap-postgresql.md#postgresql-versions-UpgradingPLv8) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_.

routing.

- Parallel queries – When you create a
new PostgreSQL 10.1 instance, parallel queries are enabled for the
`default.postgres10` parameter group. The parameter [max\_parallel\_workers\_per\_gather](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/runtime-config-resource.html) is set to 2 by default, but you
can modify it to support your specific workload requirements.

- Support for the international components for unicode
(ICU) – You can use the ICU library to provide
explicitly versioned collations. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 10.1 is compiled with
ICU version 60.2. For more information about ICU implementation in
PostgreSQL, see [Collation\
support](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/collation.html).

- Huge pages – Huge pages is a feature
of the Linux kernel that uses multiple page size capabilities of modern
hardware architectures. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL supports huge pages with a
global configuration parameter. When you create a new PostgreSQL 10.1
instance with RDS, the `huge_pages` parameter is set to
`"on"` for the `default.postgres10` parameter
group. You can modify this setting to support your specific workload
requirements.

- Extension plv8 update – plv8 is a
procedural language that you can use to write functions in JavaScript that
you can then call from SQL. This release of PostgreSQL supports version
2.1.0 of plv8.

- Renaming of xlog and location – In
PostgreSQL version 10 the abbreviation "xlog" has changed to "wal", and the
term "location" has changed to "lsn". For more information, see [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/release-10.html#id-1.11.6.8.4](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/release-10.html).

- tsearch2 extension – Amazon RDS continues
to provide the `tsearch2` extension in PostgreSQL version 10, but
is to remove it in the next major version release. If your application uses
tsearch2 functions update it to use the equivalent functions the core engine
provides. For more information see [tsearch2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/tsearch2.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.
