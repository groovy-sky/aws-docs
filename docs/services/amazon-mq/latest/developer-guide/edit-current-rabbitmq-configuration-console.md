# Edit a Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ Configuration Revision

The following instructions describe how to edit a configuration revision for your broker.

1. Sign in to the [Amazon MQ console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq).

2. From the broker list, select your broker (for example, **MyBroker**) and then choose **Edit**.

3. On the **`MyBroker`** page,
    choose **Edit**.

4. On the **Edit `MyBroker`**
    page, in the **Configuration** section, select a **Configuration**
    and a **Revision** and then choose **Edit**.

###### Note

Unless you select a configuration when you create a broker,
the first configuration revision is always created for you
when Amazon MQ creates the broker.

On the **`MyBroker`** page,
    the broker engine type and version that the configuration uses (for
    example, **RabbitMQ 3.xx.xx**) are
    displayed.

5. On the **Configuration details** tab, the configuration
    revision number, description, and broker configuration in Cuttlefish format are displayed.

###### Note

Editing the current configuration creates a new configuration revision.

6. Choose **Edit configuration** and make changes to the Cuttlefish configuration.

7. Choose **Save**.

The **Save revision** dialog box is displayed.

8. (Optional) Type `A description of the changes in this revision`.

9. Choose **Save**.

The new revision of the configuration is saved.

###### Important

Making changes to a configuration does _not_ apply the changes to the broker immediately.
To apply your changes, you must wait for the next maintenance window
or [reboot the broker](amazon-mq-rebooting-broker.md).

Currently, you can't delete a configuration.
