# Editing broker preferences

You can edit your broker preferences, such as enabling or disabling CloudWatch logs using the AWS Management Console.

## Edit RabbitMQ broker options

1. Sign in to the [Amazon MQ console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq).

2. From the broker list, select your broker (for example, **MyBroker**) and then choose **Edit**.

3. On the **Edit `MyBroker`** page,
    in the **Specifications** section, select a
    **Broker engine version** or a **Broker**
**Instance type**.

4. In the **CloudWatch Logs** section, click the toggle button to enable or disable general logs. No other steps are required.

###### Note

- For RabbitMQ brokers, Amazon MQ automatically uses a Service-Linked Role (SLR) to publish general logs to CloudWatch. For more information, see
[Using service-linked roles for Amazon MQ](using-service-linked-roles.md)

- Amazon MQ does not support audit logging for RabbitMQ brokers.

5. In the **Maintenance** section, configure your
    broker's maintenance schedule:

To upgrade the broker to new versions as AWS releases them, choose
    **Enable automatic minor version upgrades**.
    Automatic upgrades occur during the _maintenance window_
    defined by the day of the week, the time of day (in 24-hour format), and the time zone (UTC by default).

6. Choose **Schedule modifications**.

###### Note

If you choose only **Enable automatic minor version**
**upgrades**, the button changes to **Save**
because no broker reboot is necessary.

Your preferences are applied to your broker at the specified time.
