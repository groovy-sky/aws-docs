# Creating and configuring an Amazon MQ network of brokers

A _network of brokers_ is comprised of multiple simultaneously
active [single-instance brokers](amazon-mq-broker-architecture.md#single-broker-deployment) or [active/standby brokers](amazon-mq-broker-architecture.md#active-standby-broker-deployment). In this tutorial, you learn how to create a two-broker
network of brokers with a _source and sink_ topology.

For a conceptual overview and detailed configuration information, see the
following:

- [Amazon MQ network of brokers](network-of-brokers.md)

- [Configure Your Network of Brokers Correctly](best-practices-activemq.md#network-of-brokers-configure-correctly)

- `networkConnector`

- `networkConnectionStartAsync`

- [Networks of\
Brokers](http://activemq.apache.org/networks-of-brokers.html) in the ActiveMQ documentation

You can use the Amazon MQ console to create an Amazon MQ network of brokers. Because you can
start the creation of the two brokers in parallel, this process takes approximately 15
minutes.

## Prerequisites

To create a network of brokers, you must have the following:

- Two or more simultaneously active brokers (named `MyBroker1`
and `MyBroker2` in this tutorial). For more information about
creating brokers, see [Getting started: Creating and connecting to an ActiveMQ broker](getting-started-activemq.md).

- The two brokers must be in the same VPC or in peered VPCs. For more
information about VPCs, see [What is Amazon VPC?](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.md)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_ and [What is VPC Peering?](../../../vpc/latest/peering/welcome.md) in the
_Amazon VPC Peering Guide_.

###### Important

If you don't have a default VPC, subnet(s), or security group, you
must create them first. For more information, see the following in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_:

- [Creating a Default VPC](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.md#create-default-vpc)

- [Creating a Default Subnet](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.md#create-default-subnet)

- [Creating a Security Group](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-securitygroups.md#CreatingSecurityGroups)

- Two users with identical sign-in credentials for both brokers. For
more information about creating users, see [Creating an ActiveMQ broker user](amazon-mq-listing-managing-users.md).

###### Note

When integrating LDAP authentication with a network of brokers, make sure that the user exists both as an ActiveMQ brokers, as well as an LDAP user.

The following example uses two [single-instance brokers](amazon-mq-broker-architecture.md#single-broker-deployment). However, you can create networks of brokers
using [active/standby brokers](amazon-mq-broker-architecture.md#active-standby-broker-deployment)
or a combination of broker deployment modes.

## Step 1: Allow Traffic between Brokers

After you create your brokers, you must allow traffic between them.

1. On the [Amazon MQ console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq),
    on the **MyBroker2** page, in the
    **Details** section, under **Security and**
**network**, choose the name of your security group or ![Pencil icon indicating an edit or modification action.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/images/amazon-mq-tutorials-broker-details-link.png).

The **Security Groups** page of the EC2 Dashboard is
    displayed.

2. From the security group list, choose your security group.

3. At the bottom of the page, choose **Inbound**, and then
    choose **Edit**.

4. In the **Edit inbound rules** dialog box, add a rule for
    the OpenWire endpoint.
1. Choose **Add Rule**.

2. For **Type**, select **Custom**
      **TCP**.

3. For **Port Range**, type the OpenWire port
       ( `61617`).

4. Do one of the following:

- If you want to restrict access to a particular IP address,
for **Source**, leave
**Custom** selected, and then enter the
IP address of `MyBroker1`, followed by
`/32`. (This converts the IP address to a
valid CIDR record). For more information see [Elastic Network\
Interfaces](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-eni.md).

###### Tip

To retrieve the IP address of `MyBroker1`,
on the [Amazon MQ\
console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq), choose the name of the broker and
navigate to the **Details**
section.

- If all the brokers are private and belong to the same VPC,
for **Source**, leave
**Custom** selected and then type the
ID of the security group you are editing.

###### Note

For public brokers, you must restrict access using IP
addresses.

5. Choose **Save**.

      Your broker can now accept inbound connections.

## Step 2: Configure Network Connectors for Your Broker

After you allow traffic between your brokers, you must configure network
connectors for one of them.

1. Edit the configuration revision for broker `MyBroker1`.
1. On the **MyBroker1** page, choose
       **Edit**.

2. On the **Edit MyBroker1** page, in the
       **Configuration** section, choose
       **View**.

      The broker engine type and version that the configuration uses
       (for example, **Apache ActiveMQ 5.15.0**) are
       displayed.

3. On the **Configuration details** tab, the
       configuration revision number, description, and broker configuration
       in XML format are displayed.

4. Choose **Edit configuration**.

5. At the bottom of the configuration file, uncomment the
       `<networkConnectors>` section and include the
       following information:

- The `name` for the network connector.

- [The ActiveMQ Web Console username](#creating-configuring-network-of-brokers-create-brokers)
that is common to both brokers.

- Enable `duplex` connections.

- Do one of the following:

- If you are connecting the broker to a
single-instance broker, use the `static:`
prefix and the OpenWire endpoint `uri`
for `MyBroker2`. For example:

```xml

<networkConnectors>
    <networkConnector name="connector_1_to_2" userName="myCommonUser" duplex="true"
      uri="static:(ssl://b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9-1.mq.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:61617)"/>
</networkConnectors>
```

- If you are connecting the broker to an
active/standby broker, use the
`static+failover` transport and the OpenWire
endpoint `uri` for both brokers with the following
query parameters `?randomize=false&maxReconnectAttempts=0`.
For example:

```xml

<networkConnectors>
    <networkConnector name="connector_1_to_2" userName="myCommonUser" duplex="true"
      uri="static:(failover:(ssl://b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9-1.mq.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:61617,
      ssl://b-9876l5k4-32ji-109h-8gfe-7d65c4b132a1-2.mq.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:61617)?randomize=false&amp;maxReconnectAttempts=0)"/>
</networkConnectors>
```

###### Note

Don't include the sign-in credentials for the ActiveMQ
user.

6. Choose **Save**.

7. In the **Save revision** dialog box, type
       `Add network of brokers connector for
      								MyBroker2`.

8. Choose **Save** to save the new revision of the
       configuration.
2. Edit `MyBroker1` to set the latest configuration revision to
    apply immediately.

1. On the **MyBroker1** page, choose
       **Edit**.

2. On the **Edit MyBroker1** page, in the
       **Configuration** section, choose
       **Schedule Modifications**.

3. In the **Schedule broker modifications** section,
       choose to apply modifications
       **Immediately**.

4. Choose **Apply**.

      `MyBroker1` is rebooted and your configuration revision
       is applied.

The network of brokers is created.

## Next Steps

After you configure your network of brokers, you can test it by producing and
consuming messages.

###### Important

Make sure that you [enable inbound connections](amazon-mq-working-java-example.md#quick-start-allow-inbound-connections) _from your local machine_ for broker `MyBroker1`
on port 8162 (for the ActiveMQ Web Console) and port 61617 (for the OpenWire
endpoint).

You might also need to adjust your security group(s) settings to allow the
producer and consumer to connect to the network of brokers.

1. On the [Amazon MQ console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq),
    navigate to the **Connections** section and note the
    ActiveMQ Web Console endpoint for broker `MyBroker1`.

2. Navigate to the ActiveMQ Web Console for broker
    `MyBroker1`.

3. To verify that the network bridge is connected, choose
    **Network**.

In the **Network Bridges** section, the name and the
    address of `MyBroker2` are listed in the **Remote**
**Broker** and **Remote Address**
    columns.

4. From any machine that has access to broker `MyBroker2`, create
    a consumer. For example:

```bash

activemq consumer --brokerUrl "ssl://b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9-1.mq.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:61617" \
   	--user commonUser \
   	--password myPassword456 \
   	--destination queue://MyQueue
```

The consumer connects to the OpenWire endpoint of `MyBroker2`
    and begins to consume messages from queue `MyQueue`.

5. From any machine that has access to broker `MyBroker1`, create
    a producer and send some messages. For example:

```bash

activemq producer --brokerUrl "ssl://b-9876l5k4-32ji-109h-8gfe-7d65c4b132a1-1.mq.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:61617" \
   	--user commonUser \
   	--password myPassword456 \
   	--destination queue://MyQueue \
   	--persistent true \
   	--messageSize 1000 \
   	--messageCount 10000
```

The producer connects to the OpenWire endpoint of `MyBroker1`
    and begins to produce persistent messages to queue
    `MyQueue`.
