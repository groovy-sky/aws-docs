# Quotas in Amazon MQ
<a name="amazon-mq-limits"></a>

This topic lists limits within Amazon MQ. Many of the following limits can be changed for specific AWS accounts. To request an increase for a limit, see [AWS Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*. Updated limits will not be visible even after the limit increase has been applied. For more information on viewing current connection limits in Amazon CloudWatch, see [ Monitoring Amazon MQ brokers using Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/security-logging-monitoring-cloudwatch.html).

## Brokers
<a name="broker-limits"></a>

The following table lists quotas related to Amazon MQ brokers.

| Limit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Broker name |  +  Must be unique in your AWS account. <br />+  Must be 1-50 characters long. <br />+  Must contain only characters specified in the [ASCII Printable Character Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters). <br />+  Can contain only alphanumeric characters, dashes, periods, underscores, and tildes (`- . _ ~`).   |

| Wire-level connections per broker (ActiveMQ) |  300 for mq.\*.micro instance type brokers, per wire-level protocol.  |
| Wire-level connections per broker (ActiveMQ) |  2,000 for mq.\*.\*large instance type brokers, per wire-level protocol.  |
| Connections per node (RabbitMQ) | Connection limits for RabbitMQ brokers are applied *per node* and are determined by the broker's instance type. These limits cannot be overridden by customers. The `max-connections` vhost limit configured via the Management UI restricts connections per vhost but does not override the per-node limit enforced by the broker.<br />For the complete list of per-node connection limits by instance type, see [Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ sizing guidelines](rabbitmq-sizing-guidelines.md). |

## API Throttling
<a name="api-throttling-limits"></a>

The following throttling quotas are aggregated per AWS account, *across all Amazon MQ APIs* to maintain service bandwidth. For more information about Amazon MQ APIs, see the *[Amazon MQ REST API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/api-reference/)*.

**Important**
These quotas don't apply to Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ or Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ broker messaging APIs. For example, Amazon MQ doesn't throttle the sending or receiving of messages.
