# Amazon MQ Child Element Attributes

The following is a detailed explanation of child element attributes. For more
information, see [XML\
Configuration](http://activemq.apache.org/xml-configuration.html) in the Apache ActiveMQ documentation.

###### Topics

- [authorizationEntry](#authorizationEntry)

- [networkConnector](#networkConnector)

- [kahaDB](#kahaDB)

- [systemUsage](#systemUsage)

## authorizationEntry

`authorizationEntry` is a child of the
`authorizationEntries` child collection element.

### Attributes

#### admin\|read\|write

The permissions granted to a group of users.
For more information, see
[Always configure an authorization map](using-amazon-mq-securely.md#always-configure-authorization-map).

If you specify an authorization map which doesn't include the
`activemq-webconsole` group, you can't use the ActiveMQ Web Console because the group isn't authorized to send
messages to, or receive messages from, the Amazon MQ broker.

**Default:** `null`

### Example Configuration

```xml

<authorizationPlugin>
                                <map>
                                    <authorizationMap>
                                        <authorizationEntries>
                                            <authorizationEntry admin="admins,activemq-webconsole" read="admins,users,activemq-webconsole" write="admins,activemq-webconsole" queue=">"/>
                                            <authorizationEntry admin="admins,activemq-webconsole" read="admins,users,activemq-webconsole" write="admins,activemq-webconsole" topic=">"/>
                                        </authorizationEntries>
                                    </authorizationMap>
                                </map>
                                </authorizationPlugin>
```

###### Note

The `activemq-webconsole` group in ActiveMQ on Amazon MQ has admin permissions on all queues and topics.
All users in this group will have admin access.

## networkConnector

`networkConnector` is a child of the `networkConnectors`
child collection element.

###### Topics

- [Attributes](#networkConnector-attributes)

- [Example Configurations](#networkConnector-example)

### Attributes

#### conduitSubscriptions

Specifies whether a network connection in a network of brokers treats
multiple consumers subscribed to the same destination as one consumer. For
example, if `conduitSubscriptions` is set to `true`
and two consumers connect to broker B and consume from a destination, broker
B combines the subscriptions into a single logical subscription over the
network connection to broker A, so that only a single copy of a message is
forwarded from broker A to broker B.

###### Note

Setting `conduitSubscriptions` to `true` can
reduce redundant network traffic. However, using this attribute can have
implications for the load-balancing of messages across consumers and
might cause incorrect behavior in certain scenarios (for example, with
JMS message selectors or with durable topics).

**Default:** `true`

#### duplex

Specifies whether the connection in the network of brokers is used to
produce _and_ consume messages. For example, if broker A
creates a connection to broker B in non-duplex mode, messages can be
forwarded only from broker A to broker B. However, if broker A creates a
duplex connection to broker B, then broker B can forward messages to broker
A without having to configure a `<networkConnector>`.

**Default:** `false`

#### name

The name of the bridge in the network of brokers.

**Default:** `bridge`

#### uri

The wire-level protocol endpoint for one of two brokers (or for multiple
brokers) in a network of brokers.

**Default:** `null`

#### username

The username common to the brokers in a network of brokers.

**Default:** `null`

### Example Configurations

###### Note

When using a `networkConnector` to define a network of brokers,
don't include the password for the user common to your brokers.

#### A Network of Brokers with Two Brokers

In this configuration, two brokers are connected in a network of brokers.
The name of the network connector is `connector_1_to_2`, the
username common to the brokers is `myCommonUser`, the connection
is `duplex`, and the OpenWire endpoint URI is prefixed by
`static:`, indicating a one-to-one connection between the
brokers.

```xml

<networkConnectors>
                                    <networkConnector name="connector_1_to_2" userName="myCommonUser" duplex="true"
                                        uri="static:(ssl://b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9-1.mq.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:61617)"/>
                                    </networkConnectors>
```

For more information, see [Configure Network Connectors for Your Broker](amazon-mq-creating-configuring-network-of-brokers.md#creating-configuring-network-of-brokers-configure-network-connectors).

#### A Network of Brokers with Multiple Brokers

In this configuration, multiple brokers are connected in a network of
brokers. The name of the network connector is `connector_1_to_2`,
the username common to the brokers is `myCommonUser`, the
connection is `duplex`, and the comma-separated list of OpenWire
endpoint URIs is prefixed by `masterslave:`, indicating a
failover connection between the brokers. The failover from broker to broker
isn't randomized and reconnection attempts continue indefinitely.

```xml

<networkConnectors>
                                    <networkConnector name="connector_1_to_2" userName="myCommonUser" duplex="true"
                                        uri="masterslave:(ssl://b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9-1.mq.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:61617,
                                        ssl://b-9876l5k4-32ji-109h-8gfe-7d65c4b132a1-2.mq.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:61617)"/>
                                    </networkConnectors>
```

###### Note

We recommend using the `masterslave:` prefix for networks
of brokers. The prefix is identical to the more explicit
`static:failover:()?randomize=false&maxReconnectAttempts=0`
syntax.

###### Note

This XML configuration does not allow spaces.

## kahaDB

`kahaDB` is a child of the `persistenceAdapter` child
collection element.

### Attributes

#### concurrentStoreAndDispatchQueues

Specifies whether to use concurrent store and dispatch for queues. For
more information, see [Disable Concurrent Store and Dispatch for Queues with Slow Consumers](best-practices-activemq.md#disable-concurrent-store-and-dispatch-queues-flag-slow-consumers).

**Default:** `true`

#### cleanupOnStop

###### Supported in

Apache ActiveMQ 15.16.x and above

If deactivated, garbage collection and cleanup does not take place when the broker is stopped, which speeds up the shutdown process.
The increased speed is useful in cases with large databases or scheduler databases.

**Default:** `true`

#### journalDiskSyncInterval

Interval (ms) for when to perform a disk sync if
`journalDiskSyncStrategy=periodic`. For more information, see
the [Apache ActiveMQ kahaDB\
documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/kahadb).

**Default:** `1000`

#### journalDiskSyncStrategy

###### Supported in

Apache ActiveMQ 15.14.x and above

Configures the disk sync policy. For more information, see the [Apache ActiveMQ kahaDB documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/kahadb).

**Default:** `always`

###### Note

The [ActiveMQ\
documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/kahadb) states that the data loss is limited to the
duration of `journalDiskSyncInterval`, which has a default of
1s. The data loss can be longer than the interval, but it is difficult
to be precise. Use caution.

#### preallocationStrategy

Configures how the broker will try to preallocate the journal files when a
new journal file is needed. For more information, see the [Apache ActiveMQ kahaDB\
documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/kahadb).

**Default:** `sparse_file`

### Example Configuration

###### Example

```xml

<broker xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core">
                                <persistenceAdapter>
                                <kahaDB preallocationStrategy="zeros" concurrentStoreAndDispatchQueues="false" journalDiskSyncInterval="10000" journalDiskSyncStrategy="periodic"/>
                            </persistenceAdapter>
                            </broker>
```

## systemUsage

`systemUsage` is a child of the `systemUsage` child
collection element. It controls the maximum amount of space the broker will use
before slowing down producers. For more information, see [Producer Flow\
Control](http://activemq.apache.org/producer-flow-control.html) in the Apache ActiveMQ documentation.

### Child Element

#### memoryUsage

`memoryUsage` is a child of the `systemUsage` child
element. It manages memory usage. Use `memoryUsage` to keep track
of how much of something is being used so that you can control working set
usage productively. For more information, see [the schema](http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/activemq-core-5.15.12-schema.html) in the Apache ActiveMQ documentation.

##### Child Element

`memoryUsage` is a child of the `memoryUsage`
child element.

##### Attribute

##### percentOfJvmHeap

Integer between 0 (inclusive) and 70 (inclusive).

_Default:_ `70`

### Attributes

#### sendFailIfNoSpace

Sets whether a `send()` method should fail if there is no space
free. The default value is false, which blocks the `send()`
method until space becomes available. For more information, see the [schema](http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/activemq-core-5.15.12-schema.html) in the Apache Active MQ documentation.

**Default:** `false`

#### sendFailIfNoSpaceAfterTimeout

**Default:** `null`

#### Example Configuration

###### Example

```xml

<broker xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core">
                                <systemUsage>
                                <systemUsage sendFailIfNoSpace="true" sendFailIfNoSpaceAfterTimeout="2000">
                                    <memoryUsage>
                                        <memoryUsage  percentOfJvmHeap="60" />
                                    </memoryUsage>>
                                </systemUsage>
                                </systemUsage>
                            </broker>
                            </persistenceAdapter>
```
