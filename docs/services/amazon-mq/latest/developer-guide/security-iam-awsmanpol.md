# AWS managed policies for Amazon MQ
<a name="security-iam-awsmanpol"></a>

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles.

Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because they're available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining [ customer managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#customer-managed-policies) that are specific to your use cases.

You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for existing services.

For more information, see [AWS managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) in the *IAM User Guide*.

Amazon MQ supports the following AWS managed policies:
+ [AmazonMQApiFullAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonMQApiFullAccess.html)
+ [AmazonMQApiReadOnlyAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonMQApiReadOnlyAccess.html)
+ [AmazonMQFullAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonMQFullAccess.html)
+ [AmazonMQReadOnlyAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonMQReadOnlyAccess.html)
+ [AmazonMQServiceRolePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonMQServiceRolePolicy.html)

## AWS managed policy: AmazonMQServiceRolePolicy

You can't attach `AmazonMQServiceRolePolicy` to your IAM entities. This policy is attached to a service-linked role that allows Amazon MQ to perform actions on your behalf. For more information about this permission policy and the actions it allows Amazon MQ to perform, see [Service-linked role permissions for Amazon MQ](using-service-linked-roles.md#slr-permissions).
