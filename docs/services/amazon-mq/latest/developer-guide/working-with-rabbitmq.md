# Using Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ

Amazon MQ makes it easy to create a message broker with the computing and storage resources
that fit your needs. You can create, manage, and delete brokers using the AWS Management Console, Amazon MQ
REST API, or the AWS Command Line Interface.

This section describes the basic elements of a message broker for ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ engine types, lists available Amazon MQ
broker instance types and their statuses, and provides an overview of broker architecture and configuration options.

To learn about Amazon MQ REST APIs, see the _[Amazon MQ REST API Reference](../api-reference.md)_.

## What is an Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ broker?

A _broker_ is a message broker environment running on Amazon MQ. It is the basic building block of Amazon MQ. The combined description of the
broker instance _class_ ( `m7g`) and
_size_ ( `large`, `medium`) is called the
_broker instance type_ (for example, `mq.m7g.large`).

- A _single-instance broker_
consists of one broker in one Availability Zone behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB).
The broker communicates with your application and with an Amazon EBS storage volume.

- A _cluster deployment_
is a logical grouping of three RabbitMQ broker nodes behind a Network Load Balancer, each sharing users, queues, and a distributed state across multiple Availability Zones (AZ).

### Listener ports

Amazon MQ managed RabbitMQ brokers support the following listener ports for application-level connectivity via `amqps`. You can also use these ports for
client connections using the RabbitMQ web console and the management API. All connections use TLS encryption for security.

- Listener port `5671` \- Used for secure AMQP connections made via the secure AMQP URL. This port supports both AMQP 0-9-1 and AMQP 1.0 protocols in RabbitMQ 4. For example, given a
broker with broker ID `b-c8352341-ec91-4a78-ad9c-a43f23d325bb`, deployed in the `us-west-2` region, the following is the broker's full `amqps`
URL: `b-c8352341-ec91-4a78-ad9c-a43f23d325bb.mq.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:5671`.

- Listener ports `443` and `15671` \- You can use both listener ports interchangeably to access a broker via
the RabbitMQ web console or the management API. Port 443 provides standard HTTPS access, while port 15671 is the traditional RabbitMQ management port with TLS encryption.

### Attributes

A RabbitMQ broker has several attributes:

- A name. For example, `MyBroker`.

- An ID. For example, `b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9`.

- An Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For example, `arn:aws:mq:us-east-2:123456789012:broker:MyBroker:b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9`.

- A RabbitMQ web console URL.
For example, `https://b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9-1.mq.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`.

For more information, see [RabbitMQ web console](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) in the RabbitMQ documentation.

- A secure AMQP endpoint. For example, `amqps://b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9-1.mq.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`.
