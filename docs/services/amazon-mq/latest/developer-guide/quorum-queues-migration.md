# Migrating from classic queues to quorum queues on Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ

You can migrate your classic mirrored queues to quorum queues on
Amazon MQ brokers on version 3.13 or above
by creating a new virtual host on the same cluster,
or by migrating in place.

## Option 1: Migrating from classic mirrored queues to quorum queues with a new virtual host

You can migrate your classic mirrored queues to quorum queues on
Amazon MQ brokers on version 3.13 or above
by creating a new virtual host on the same cluster.

1. In your existing cluster, create a new virtual host (vhost)
    with the default queue type as quorum.

2. Create the [Federation plugin](rabbitmq-basic-elements-plugins.md#rabbitmq-federation-plugin)
    from the new vhost with the URI pointing to the old vhost using classic mirrored queues.

3. Using `rabbitmqadmin`, export the definitions from the old vhost to a new file. You must make changes
    to the schema file so it is compatible with quorum queues. For the full list of changes you
    need to make to the file, see [Moving definitions](https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2023/03/02/quorum-queues-migration)
    in the RabbitMQ quorum queues documentation. After applying the necessary changes to the file,
    reimport the definitions to the new vhost.

4. Create a new policy in the new vhost. For recommendations on Amazon MQ policy configurations
    for quorum queues, see [Policy configurations for quorum queues for Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ](quorum-queues-policy-configurations.md) . Then, start the Federation you created earlier from the old vhost
    to the new vhost.

5. Point consumers and producers to the new vhost.

6. Configure the Shovel plug in to move any remaining messages. Once a queue is empty, delete the Shovel.

## Migrating from classic mirrored queues to quorum queues in place

You can migrate your classic mirrored queues to quorum queues on
Amazon MQ brokers on version 3.13 or above
by migrating in place.

1. Stop the consumers and producers.

2. Create a new temporary quorum queue.

3. Configure the Shovel plug in to move any messages from the old classic mirrored queue to the new temporary quorum queue. After all messages are moved to the temporary quorum queue, delete the Shovel.

4. Delete the source classic mirrored queue. Then, recreate a quorum queue
    with the same name and bindings as the source classic mirrored queue.

5. Create a new Shovel to move the messages from the temporary quorum queue to the new quorum queue.
