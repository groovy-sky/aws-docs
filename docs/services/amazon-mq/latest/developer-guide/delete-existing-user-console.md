# Delete an ActiveMQ broker user

When you no longer need a user, you can delete the user.

1. Sign in to the [Amazon MQ console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq).

2. From the broker list, choose the name of your broker (for example, **MyBroker**)
    and then choose **View details**.

On the **`MyBroker`** page, in the **Users** section, all the users for this broker are listed.

3. Select a your sign-in credentials (for example,
    **`MyUser`**) and then
    choose **Delete**.

4. To confirm deleting the user, in the **Delete**
**`MyUser`?** dialog box, choose
    **Delete**.

###### Important

Making changes to a user does _not_ apply the changes to the user immediately.
To apply your changes, you must wait for the next maintenance window
or [reboot the broker](amazon-mq-rebooting-broker.md).
