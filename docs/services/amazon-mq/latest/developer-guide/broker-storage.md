# Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ storage types

Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ supports Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) and Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS). By default, ActiveMQ brokers use Amazon EFS for broker storage.
To take advantage of high durability and replication across multiple Availability Zones, use Amazon EFS.
To take advantage of low latency and high throughput, use Amazon EBS.

###### Important

- You can use Amazon EBS only with the `mq.m5` broker instance type family.

- Although you can change the _broker instance type_, you can't change the
_broker storage type_ after you create the broker.

- Amazon EBS replicates data within a single Availability Zone and doesn't support the
[ActiveMQ active/standby](amazon-mq-broker-architecture.md#active-standby-broker-deployment) deployment mode.

## Differences between Storage Types

The following table provides a brief overview of the differences between
in-memory, Amazon EFS, and Amazon EBS storage types for ActiveMQ brokers.

In-memory message storage provides the lowest latency and the highest
throughput. However, messages are lost during instance replacement or broker
restart.

Amazon EFS is designed to be highly durable, replicated across multiple AZs to
prevent the loss of data resulting from the failure of any single component or
an issue that affects the availability of an AZ. Amazon EBS is optimized for
throughput and replicated across multiple servers within a single AZ.
