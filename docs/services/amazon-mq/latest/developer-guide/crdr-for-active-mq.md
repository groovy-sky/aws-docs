# Cross-Region data replication for Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ
<a name="crdr-for-active-mq"></a>

 Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ offers a Cross-Region data replication (CRDR) feature that allows for asynchronous message replication from the primary broker in a primary AWS Region to the replica broker in a replica Region. By issuing a failover request to the Amazon MQ API, the current replica broker is promoted to the primary broker role, and the current primary broker is demoted to the replica role.

## Primary and replica brokers for cross-Region data replication
<a name="crdr-primary-replica-brokers"></a>

 You can create primary and replica brokers for asynchronous data replication from the primary broker in a primary AWS Region to the replica broker in a replica Region. The *primary Region* consists of a redundant pair of active/standby brokers referred to as the *primary broker*. The *secondary Region* consists of a redundant pair of active/standby brokers referred to as the *replica broker*.

 The following diagram illustrates a replica broker in a secondary Region receiving asynchronous replicated data from the primary broker in the primary Region.

 Primary and replica brokers act as a cross-Region data recovery solution. If the primary broker in the primary Region fails, you can promote the replica broker in the secondary Region to primary by initiating a switchover or failover. The former primary broker then becomes the replica broker, and the former replica broker is promoted to primary broker. For instructions on creating a primary and replica broker, see [Creating an Amazon MQ cross-Region data replication broker](create-replica-broker.md).

**Note**
Only available for active/standby brokers.
Not available for mirrored queues.
