- Amazon MQ supports RabbitMQ 3.8.6. For more information about supported engine versions, see [Managing Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ engine versions](rabbitmq-version-management.md).

- The [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free) includes up to 750 hours of a
single-instance `mq.t3.micro` broker and up to 20GB of storage per month for one year.
For more information about supported instance types, see [Broker instance types](broker-instance-types.md).

- With Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ, you can access your brokers using AMQP 0-9-1,
and with any language supported by the [RabbitMQ client libraries](https://www.rabbitmq.com/devtools.html).
For more information about supported protocols and cipher suites, see [Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ protocols](data-protection.md#rabbitmq-protocol-and-ciphers).

- Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ is available in all regions that Amazon MQ is currently available. To learn more about all of the available regions,
see the [AWS Region Table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

December 19, 2019Amazon MQ is available in the Europe (Stockholm) and South America (São Paulo)
regions. For information on available regions, see [AWS\
Regions and Endpoints](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande.md#amazon-mq_region).December 16, 2019Amazon MQ supports creating throughput-optimized brokers by using Amazon Elastic Block Store
(EBS)—instead of the default Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)—for broker
storage. To take advantage of high durability and replication across multiple Availability Zones, use Amazon EFS.
To take advantage of low latency and high throughput, use Amazon EBS.

###### Important

- You can use Amazon EBS only with the `mq.m5` broker instance type family.

- Although you can change the _broker instance type_, you can't change the
_broker storage type_ after you create the broker.

- Amazon EBS replicates data within a single Availability Zone and doesn't support the
[ActiveMQ active/standby](amazon-mq-broker-architecture.md#active-standby-broker-deployment) deployment mode.

For more information, see the following:

- [Storage](broker-storage.md)

- [Choose the correct broker storage type for the best throughput](best-practices-activemq.md#broker-storage-types-choosing)

- The `storageType` property of the [`broker-instance-options`](../api-reference/broker-instance-options.md) resource

Amazon MQ supports using AWS KMS keys in the following
ways.

- **AWS owned KMS key** — The key is owned
Amazon MQ and is not in your account.

The following changes affect the [Amazon MQ console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq):

- In the broker list, the **Creation** column
is hidden by default. To customize the page size and columns,
choose ![Gear or cog icon representing settings or configuration options.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/images/amazon-mq-tutorials-broker-list-preferences.png).

- On the
**`MyBroker`**
page, in the **Connections** section, choosing
the name of your security group or ![Pencil icon indicating an edit or modification action.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/images/amazon-mq-tutorials-broker-details-link.png) opens the EC2 console (instead of the VPC
console). The EC2 console allows more intuitive configuration of
inbound and outbound rules. For more information, see the
updated [Connecting a Java application to your broker](amazon-mq-connecting-application.md) section.

- The permission for REST operation ID [`UpdateBroker`](../api-reference/rest-api-broker.md#rest-api-broker-methods-put) is listed correctly
as `mq:UpdateBroker` on the IAM console.

- The erroneous `mq:DescribeEngine` permission is
removed from the IAM console.

November 28, 2017This is the initial release of Amazon MQ and the
_Amazon MQ Developer Guide_.

- Amazon MQ is avaialble in the following regions:

- US East (Ohio)

- US East (N. Virginia)

- US West (Oregon)

- Asia Pacific (Sydney)

- Europe (Frankfurt)

- Europe (Ireland)

Using the `mq.t2.micro` instance type is subject to _[CPU credits and baseline performance](../../../ec2/latest/developerguide/t2-credits-baseline-concepts.md)_—with the ability
to _burst_ above the baseline level (for more information, see the [CpuCreditBalance](activemq-logging-monitoring.md#security-logging-monitoring-cloudwatch-metrics) metric).
If your application requires _fixed performance_, consider using an `mq.m5.large` instance type.

- You can create `mq.m4.large` and
`mq.t2.micro` brokers.

- You can use the ActiveMQ 5.15.0 broker engine.

- You can also create and manage brokers programmatically using Amazon MQ
[REST API](../api-reference.md) and AWS SDKs.

- You can access your brokers by using [any programming language that ActiveMQ supports](http://activemq.apache.org/cross-language-clients.html) and by enabling TLS explicitly for the following protocols:

- [AMQP](http://activemq.apache.org/amqp.html)

- [MQTT](http://activemq.apache.org/mqtt.html)

- MQTT over [WebSocket](http://activemq.apache.org/websockets.html)

- [OpenWire](http://activemq.apache.org/openwire.html)

- [STOMP](http://activemq.apache.org/stomp.html)

- STOMP over WebSocket

- You can connect to ActiveMQ brokers using [various ActiveMQ clients](http://activemq.apache.org/cross-language-clients.html).
We recommend using the [ActiveMQ Client](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.activemq/activemq-client). For more information, see [Connecting a Java application to your broker](amazon-mq-connecting-application.md).

- Your broker can send and receive messages of any size.
