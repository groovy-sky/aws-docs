# Data protection in Amazon MQ

The AWS [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model)
applies to data protection in Amazon MQ. As described in this model, AWS is
responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all of the AWS Cloud. You are
responsible for maintaining control over your content that is hosted on this infrastructure.
You are also responsible for the security configuration and management tasks for the AWS services
that you use. For more information about data privacy, see the [Data Privacy FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq). For information about data protection in Europe, see the [AWS Shared\
Responsibility Model and GDPR](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/the-aws-shared-responsibility-model-and-gdpr) blog post on the _AWS Security_
_Blog_.

For data protection purposes, we recommend that you protect AWS account
credentials and set up individual users with AWS IAM Identity Center or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). That way, each user is given only the permissions necessary to fulfill their job duties. We also recommend that you secure your data in the following ways:

- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) with each account.

- Use SSL/TLS to communicate with AWS resources. We require TLS 1.2 and recommend TLS 1.3.

- Set up API and user activity logging with AWS CloudTrail. For information about using CloudTrail trails to capture AWS activities, see [Working with CloudTrail trails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-trails.html) in the _AWS CloudTrail User Guide_.

- Use AWS encryption solutions, along with all default security controls within AWS services.

- Use advanced managed security services such as Amazon Macie, which assists in discovering
and securing sensitive data that is stored in Amazon S3.

- If you require FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic modules when accessing AWS through
a command line interface or an API, use a FIPS endpoint. For more information about the
available FIPS endpoints, see [Federal\
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips).

We strongly recommend that you never put confidential or sensitive information, such as your
customers' email addresses, into tags or free-form text fields such as a **Name** field. This includes when you work with Amazon MQ or other AWS services
using the console, API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Any data that you enter into
tags or free-form text fields used for names may be used for billing or diagnostic logs. If you
provide a URL to an external server, we strongly recommend that you do not include credentials
information in the URL to validate your request to that server.

For both Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ and Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ brokers, do not use
any personally identifiable information (PII) or other confidential or sensitive information for broker names or usernames when
creating resources via the broker web console, or the Amazon MQ API. Broker names and usernames are accessible to other AWS services,
including CloudWatch Logs. Broker usernames are not intended to be used for private or sensitive data.

###### Important

TLS 1.3 is not available for RabbitMQ brokers.

## Encryption

User data stored in Amazon MQ is encrypted at rest. Amazon MQ encryption at rest provides
enhanced security by encrypting your data using encryption keys stored in the AWS Key Management Service
(KMS). This service helps reduce the operational burden and complexity involved in
protecting sensitive data. With encryption at rest, you can build security-sensitive
applications that meet encryption compliance and regulatory requirements.

All connections between Amazon MQ brokers use Transport layer Security (TLS) to provide
encryption in transit.

Amazon MQ encrypts messages at rest and in transit using encryption keys that it manages and stores securely.
For more information, see the _[AWS Encryption SDK Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide)_.

## Encryption at rest

Amazon MQ integrates with AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to offer transparent server-side encryption.
Amazon MQ always encrypts your data at rest.

When you create an Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ broker or an Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ broker, you
can specify the AWS KMS key that you want Amazon MQ to use to encrypt your data at
rest. If you do not specify a KMS key, Amazon MQ creates an AWS owned KMS key for you
and uses it on your behalf. Amazon MQ currently supports symmetric KMS keys.
For more information about KMS keys, see [AWS KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys).

When creating a broker, you can configure what Amazon MQ uses for your encryption key by
selecting one of the following.

- **Amazon MQ owned KMS key (default)** — The key is owned and managed by Amazon MQ and is
not in your account.

- **AWS managed KMS key** — The AWS managed KMS key ( `aws/mq`)
is a KMS key in your account that is created, managed, and used on your behalf
by Amazon MQ.

- **Select existing customer managed KMS key** —
Customer managed KMS keys are created and managed by you in AWS Key Management Service
(KMS).

###### Important

- Revoking a grant cannot be undone. Delete the broker to revoke access rights.

- For **Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ** brokers that
use Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) to store message data, it may take
several hours for permissions to use the KMS keys in your account
to be revoked after taking the required actions.

- For **Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ** and **Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ** brokers that use EBS to
store message data, if you disable, schedule for deletion, or revoke the
grant that gives Amazon EBS permission to use the KMS keys in your
account, Amazon MQ cannot maintain your broker, and it may change to a
degraded state.

- If you have deactivated the key or scheduled the key to be deleted,
you can reactivate the key or cancel key deletion and keep your broker maintained.

- It may take serveral hours to deactivate a key or revoke a grant after taking the required actions.

- For encrypting or decrypting CloudWatch logs, you cannot configure what Amazon MQ uses for your encryption key.
CloudWatch logs protects data at rest using encryption, and log groups are encrypted. The CloudWatch logs service manages
the server-side encryption by defauly. For more information on how
log groups are encrypted, see the _[Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/data-protection.html#encryption-rest)_.

When creating a [single instance broker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/rabbitmq-broker-architecture.html) with a KMS key for RabbitMQ, you will see two `CreateGrant` events logged in AWS CloudTrail.
The first event is Amazon MQ creating a grant for the KMS key. The second event is EBS creating a grant for EBS to use.

When creating a [cluster deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/rabbitmq-broker-architecture.html) with a KMS key for RabbitMQ, you will see five `CreateGrant` events logged in AWS CloudTrail.
The first two events are grant creations for Amazon MQ. The next three events are grants created by EBS for EBS to use.

## Encryption in transit

**Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ**: Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ requires strong Transport Layer Security (TLS) and encrypts data in transit
between the brokers of your Amazon MQ deployment. All data that passes between Amazon MQ brokers is encrypted using strong Transport Layer Security (TLS).
This is true for all available protocols.

**Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ**: Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ requires strong Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for all client connections.
RabbitMQ cluster replication traffic only transits your broker’s VPC and all network traffic between AWS data centers is transparently
encrypted at the physical layer. Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ clustered brokers currently do not support
[Inter-node encryption](https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering-ssl.html) for cluster replication.
To learn more about data-in-transit, see
[Encrypting Data-at-Rest and -in-Transit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/logical-separation/encrypting-data-at-rest-and--in-transit.html).
