# ActiveMQ on Amazon MQ: Deleted Elastic Network Interface alarm

ActiveMQ on Amazon MQ will raise a BROKER\_ENI\_DELETED alarm when you delete a broker’s Elastic Network Interface (ENI).
When you first [create an\
Amazon MQ broker](getting-started-activemq.md), Amazon MQ provisions an [elastic network\
interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_ElasticNetworkInterfaces.html) in the [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Introduction.html) under your account and, thus, requires a
number of [EC2\
permissions](security-api-authentication-authorization.md).

You must not modify or delete this network interface.
Modifying or deleting the network interface can cause a permanent loss of connection between
your VPC and your broker. If you wish to delete the network interface, you must delete the broker first.
