# Private networking for Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ
<a name="private-networking"></a>

Private networking enables Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ brokers to connect to private resources in your VPC. These resources can include private identity providers (LDAP or OAuth2), other Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ brokers, or self-hosted RabbitMQ brokers. You can connect to your resources privately without going over the public internet.

**Availability**
Private networking is available only for Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ brokers. ActiveMQ brokers are not supported.
Private networking is not available in the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.
Private networking is available only in AWS Regions where Amazon VPC Lattice is available. For more information about the Regions where VPC Lattice is available, see [Amazon VPC Lattice endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/vpc-lattice-service.html) in the *AWS General Reference*.

## How private networking works
<a name="private-networking-how-it-works"></a>

Private networking uses Amazon VPC Lattice, AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM), and AWS PrivateLink to connect your broker to a private destination in your VPC.

The setup involves the following components:

1. A **VPC Lattice resource gateway** in your VPC acts as the entry point for traffic from the broker to your private resources.

1. One or more **VPC Lattice resource configurations** define the private destinations (IP address or DNS name) reachable through the resource gateway.

1. An **AWS RAM resource share** packages the resource configurations and is associated with the broker through the `UpdateBroker` API operation.

1. During a broker reboot, Amazon MQ creates resource VPC endpoints in the broker's VPC. These endpoints establish the network path through your resource gateway to the configured destinations.

## Prerequisites
<a name="private-networking-prerequisites"></a>

Before you set up private networking, ensure the following:
+ You have an Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ broker in a `RUNNING` state.
+ You have a VPC with at least one subnet. This VPC hosts the resource gateway and does not need to be the same VPC as the broker. For high availability, use subnets in multiple Availability Zones.
+ The VPC Lattice resource gateway must share at least one Availability Zone with the broker. This is a concern only for single-instance brokers. Cluster brokers use every available Availability Zone.

**Note**
The broker does not need to be private. A publicly accessible broker can also use private networking.

## Setting up private networking
<a name="private-networking-setup"></a>

Follow these steps to set up private networking for your Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ broker.

### Step 1: Create a VPC Lattice resource gateway
<a name="private-networking-setup-resource-gateway"></a>

Create a VPC Lattice resource gateway in a VPC that can reach your private resources. The resource gateway acts as a transparent proxy. It routes traffic from the broker to the configured destinations.

1. Open the [Amazon VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home#ResourceGateways:).

1. In the navigation pane, under **VPC Lattice**, choose **Resource gateways**.

1. Choose **Create resource gateway**.

1. Configure the resource gateway with a VPC, subnets, and security group. Ensure at least one subnet is in an Availability Zone shared with your broker.

For more information, see [Resource gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/resource-gateways.html) in the *Amazon VPC Lattice User Guide*.

### Step 2: Create VPC Lattice resource configurations
<a name="private-networking-setup-resource-config"></a>

Create one or more resource configurations that define the private destinations your broker needs to reach. Each resource configuration specifies an IP address or DNS name that is resolvable from within the VPC where you set up the resource gateway.

You can optionally add a custom domain name to a resource configuration. Only verified domain names are usable for DNS resolution from the broker. If your resource configuration does not have a usable domain name, Amazon MQ provides a DNS name through the `DescribeSharedResources` API operation. You can use this DNS name in your broker configuration.

For more information, see [Resource configurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/resource-configurations.html) in the *Amazon VPC Lattice User Guide*.

### Step 3: Create an AWS RAM resource share
<a name="private-networking-setup-ram-share"></a>

Create an AWS RAM resource share and add your VPC Lattice resource configurations to it. The resource share is what you associate with your Amazon MQ broker.

**Important**
The resource share must allow external principals. Resource shares restricted to your organization (`allowExternalPrincipals=false`) cannot be used with Amazon MQ.

For more information, see [Creating a resource share](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-sharing-create.html) in the *AWS Resource Access Manager User Guide*.

### Step 4: Associate the resource share with your broker
<a name="private-networking-setup-associate"></a>

Use the `UpdateBroker` API operation to associate the AWS RAM resource share with your broker. You can associate multiple resource shares by providing a list of resource share ARNs.

**Example Associate a resource share using the AWS CLI**

```
aws mq update-broker \
    --broker-id {{b-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111}} \
    --resource-share-arns {{arn:aws:ram:us-east-1:123456789012:resource-share/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222}}
```

Replace the placeholders with your own values:
+ `--broker-id` – The unique ID of your broker (the {{b-a1b2c3d4-...}} value).
+ `--resource-share-arns` – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your AWS RAM resource share (the {{arn:aws:ram:...}} value).

For more information, see [UpdateBroker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/api-reference/brokers-broker-id.html) in the *Amazon MQ REST API Reference*.

To associate multiple resource shares, separate the ARNs with spaces:

```
aws mq update-broker \
    --broker-id {{b-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111}} \
    --resource-share-arns {{arn:aws:ram:us-east-1:123456789012:resource-share/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222}} {{arn:aws:ram:us-east-1:123456789012:resource-share/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE33333}}
```

**Note**
If you call `UpdateBroker` multiple times before rebooting, only the last call takes effect. The `resourceShareArns` parameter is a full replacement (put), not an additive operation. You must provide the complete list of resource share ARNs that you want associated with the broker each time you call `UpdateBroker`.

**Note**
Changes to resource share associations require a broker reboot to take effect. Calling `UpdateBroker` associates the resource share with the broker but does not establish the network path immediately.

### Step 5: Reboot the broker
<a name="private-networking-setup-reboot"></a>

Reboot the broker to apply the pending resource share changes. During the reboot, Amazon MQ creates resource VPC endpoints in the broker's VPC. It then establishes the network path to your private resources.

**Example Reboot the broker using the AWS CLI**

```
aws mq reboot-broker --broker-id {{b-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111}}
```

Rebooting causes downtime for single-instance brokers and brief unavailability (failover) for cluster brokers. Wait for the broker to return to the `RUNNING` state before proceeding. This typically takes 10 to 20 minutes.

For more information, see [RebootBroker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/api-reference/brokers-broker-id-reboot.html) in the *Amazon MQ REST API Reference*.

### Step 6: Verify the setup
<a name="private-networking-setup-verify"></a>

Use the `DescribeSharedResources` API operation to verify that your resources are available. You can also use it to retrieve the DNS names for use in your broker configuration.

**Example Verify shared resources using the AWS CLI**

```
aws mq describe-shared-resources --broker-id {{b-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111}}
```

When the setup is complete, resource shares appear in `AVAILABLE` state. Each resource configuration shows its associated DNS name.

For more information, see [DescribeSharedResources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/api-reference/brokers-broker-id-shared-resources.html) in the *Amazon MQ REST API Reference*.

## Use cases
<a name="private-networking-use-cases"></a>

The following sections describe common use cases for private networking.

### Connecting to a private identity provider
<a name="private-networking-private-idp"></a>

You can use private networking to connect your broker to a private LDAP or OAuth2 identity provider without exposing it to the public internet. After setting up private networking, use the DNS name from the `DescribeSharedResources` API response in your broker's authentication configuration.

For more information about configuring authentication, see [LDAP authentication and authorization for Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ](ldap-for-amq-for-rabbitmq.md) and [OAuth 2.0 authentication and authorization for Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ](oauth-for-amq-for-rabbitmq.md).

### Connecting to another Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ broker
<a name="private-networking-broker-to-broker"></a>

You can use private networking to connect your broker to another Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ broker using Shovel or Federation plugins. This enables private broker-to-broker communication without exposing either broker to the public internet.

When creating the resource configuration for another Amazon MQ broker, provide the broker endpoint (for example, `b-xxxx.mq.us-east-1.on.aws`) as the custom domain name. This ensures TLS certificate validation succeeds. RabbitMQ 4 and later enforces this validation by default for Shovel and Federation connections. For more information, see [AMQP client SSL configuration](rabbitmq-amqp-client-ssl-configuration.md).

Use the DNS name from the `DescribeSharedResources` API response as the destination in your Shovel or Federation configuration.

**Note**
For RabbitMQ versions earlier than 4, TLS certificate peer verification is not enforced by default for Shovel and Federation. You can either specify the broker endpoint as a custom domain name or turn off peer verification through configuration. For more information, see [AMQP client SSL configuration](rabbitmq-amqp-client-ssl-configuration.md).

### Connecting to a self-hosted RabbitMQ broker
<a name="private-networking-self-hosted"></a>

You can use private networking to connect your Amazon MQ broker to a self-hosted RabbitMQ broker in your VPC using Shovel or Federation plugins. Create a resource configuration pointing to the IP address or DNS name of your self-hosted broker. Use the DNS name from the `DescribeSharedResources` API response in your Shovel or Federation configuration.

RabbitMQ 4 and later enforces TLS certificate peer verification by default. You must either use a verified domain name or turn off peer verification through configuration. For more information, see [AMQP client SSL configuration](rabbitmq-amqp-client-ssl-configuration.md).

## Modifying shared resources
<a name="private-networking-modifying"></a>

You can modify the resource shares associated with your broker at any time. Call the `UpdateBroker` API operation with an updated list of resource share ARNs. Changes take effect after the next broker reboot.

To disassociate all resource shares from a broker, call `UpdateBroker` with an empty list of resource share ARNs, then reboot the broker.

**Important**
You can modify AWS RAM resource shares at any time. You can add or remove VPC Lattice resource configurations from a resource share. Amazon MQ does not detect these changes until you call `UpdateBroker` and reboot the broker. However, removing a resource configuration that was previously applied to the broker immediately revokes the broker's access to that resource. This revocation does not require calling `UpdateBroker` or rebooting, but the resource status in `DescribeSharedResources` will not update until you call `UpdateBroker` and reboot.

## Quotas
<a name="private-networking-quotas"></a>

The following quotas apply to private networking:

| Resource | Default limit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AWS RAM resource shares per broker | 10 | Exceeding this limit causes the UpdateBroker API call to fail. |
| VPC Lattice resource configurations per broker | 100 | The total across all associated resource shares. Excess resource configurations are marked as ERROR in the DescribeSharedResources response. |

## Resource states
<a name="private-networking-resource-states"></a>

Use the `DescribeSharedResources` API operation to check the state of your shared resources. The following table describes the possible states:

| State | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SETUP\_IN\_PROGRESS | The resource is being configured. This state appears after calling UpdateBroker and persists until the broker reboot completes. |
| AVAILABLE | The resource is active and the broker can reach the configured destination. |
| DELETION\_IN\_PROGRESS | The resource is being removed from the broker. |
| PENDING\_CREATE | The resource is queued for VPC endpoint creation. This state is brief and appears during the broker reboot workflow. |
| PENDING\_DELETE | The resource is queued for VPC endpoint deletion. This state is brief and appears during the broker reboot workflow. |
| ERROR | The resource failed to be configured. Call DescribeSharedResources for error details. Calling UpdateBroker again moves the resource back to SETUP\_IN\_PROGRESS. |

## Troubleshooting
<a name="private-networking-troubleshooting"></a>

Resource configuration is in ERROR state after reboot
Check the error details using the `DescribeSharedResources` API operation. Common causes include:
+ The VPC Lattice resource gateway does not share an Availability Zone with the broker.
+ The total number of resource configurations across all resource shares exceeds the quota.
After resolving the issue, call `UpdateBroker` again (even with the same resource share ARNs) to move the resource back to `SETUP_IN_PROGRESS`, then reboot the broker.

UpdateBroker fails with a validation error
Ensure the following:
+ The resource share ARN is valid and owned by your account.
+ The resource share is in the same Region as the broker.
+ The resource share allows external principals.
+ You have not exceeded the resource share quota per broker.

Broker cannot reach the private resource after reboot
Verify the following:
+ The resource state is `AVAILABLE` in the `DescribeSharedResources` response.
+ The security group on the resource gateway allows outbound traffic to the destination on the required ports.
+ The destination IP or DNS name in the resource configuration is reachable from the VPC where the resource gateway is deployed.
+ You are using the correct DNS name from the `DescribeSharedResources` response in your broker configuration.
