# Edit an ActiveMQ broker user
<a name="edit-existing-user-console"></a>

 To edit an existing user, do the following:

1. Sign in to the [Amazon MQ console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/).

1. From the broker list, choose the name of your broker (for example, **MyBroker**) and then choose **View details**.

   On the **{{MyBroker}}** page, in the **Users** section, all the users for this broker are listed.

1. Select your sign-in credentials and choose **Edit**.

   The **Edit user** dialog box is displayed.

1. (Optional) Type a new **Password**.

1. (Optional) Add or remove the names of groups to which the user belongs, separated by commas (for example: `Managers, Admins`).

1. (Optional) To enable the user to access the [ActiveMQ Web Console](https://activemq.apache.org/web-console.html), choose **ActiveMQ Web Console**.

1. To save the changes to the user, choose **Done**.
**Important**
Making changes to a user does *not* apply the changes to the user immediately. To apply your changes, you must wait for the next maintenance window or [reboot the broker](amazon-mq-rebooting-broker.md).
