# Adding tags to Amazon MQ resources

To organize and identify your Amazon MQ resources for cost allocation, you can add
metadata _tags_ that identify the purpose of a broker or
configuration. This is especially useful when you have many brokers. You can use cost
allocation tags to organize your AWS bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do
this, sign up to get your AWS account bill to include the tag keys and values. For
more information, see [Setting Up a\
Monthly Cost Allocation Report](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/configurecostallocreport.html#allocation-report) in the
_AWS Billing User Guide_.

For instance, you could add tags that represent the cost center and purpose of your
Amazon MQ resources:

ResourceKeyValue`Broker1``Cost Center``34567``Stack``Production``Broker2``Cost Center``34567``Stack``Production``Broker3``Cost Center``12345``Stack``Development`

This tagging scheme allows you to group two brokers performing related tasks in
the same cost center, while tagging an unrelated broker with a different cost
allocation tag.

## Adding tags in the Amazon MQ Console

You can quickly add tags to the resources
you are creating in the Amazon MQ console by following these steps:

1. From the **Create a broker** page, select
    **Additional settings**.

2. Under **Tags**, select **Add**
**tag**.

3. Enter a **Key** and **Value**
    pair.

4. (Optional) Select **Add tag** to add multiple tags to
    your broker.

5. Select **Create broker**.

To add tags as you create a configuration:

1. From the **Create configuration** page, select
    **Advanced**.

2. Under **Tags** on the **Create**
**configuration** page, select **Add**
**tag**.

3. Enter a **Key** and **Value**
    pair.

4. (Optional) Select **Add tag** to add multiple tags to
    your configuration.

5. Select **Create configuration**.

After adding tags, you can view, edit, and remove the tags for your resources in the Amazon MQ
console. You can also view the tags of your resources
using the REST API.
For more information, see the [Amazon MQ REST API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/api-reference/rest-api-tag.html).
