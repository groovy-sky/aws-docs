## Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ metrics
<a name="security-logging-monitoring-cloudwatch-metrics"></a>

| Metric | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AmqpMaximumConnections | Count | The maximum number of clients you can connect to your broker using AMQP. For more information on connection quotas, see [Quotas in Amazon MQ](amazon-mq-limits.md). |
| BurstBalance | Percent | The percentage of burst credits remaining on the Amazon EBS volume used to persist message data for throughput-optimized brokers. If this balance reaches zero, the IOPS provided by the Amazon EBS volume will decrease until the Burst Balance refills. For more information on how Burst Balances work in Amazon EBS, see: [I/O Credits and Burst Performance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html#IOcredit). |
| CpuCreditBalance | Credits (vCPU-minutes) |  This metric is available only for the `mq.t2.micro` broker instance type. <br />CPU credit metrics are available only at five-minute intervals. The number of earned CPU credits that an instance has accrued since it was launched or started (including the number of launch credits). The credit balance is available for the broker instance to spend on bursts beyond the baseline CPU utilization.<br />Credits are accrued in the credit balance after they're earned and removed from the credit balance after they're spent. The credit balance has a maximum limit. Once the limit is reached, any newly earned credits are discarded. |
| CpuUtilization | Percent | The percentage of allocated Amazon EC2 compute units that the broker currently uses. |
| CurrentConnectionsCount | Count | The current number of active connections on the current broker. |
| EstablishedConnectionsCount | Count | The total number of connections, active and inactive, that have been established on the broker. |
| HeapUsage | Percent | The percentage of the ActiveMQ JVM memory limit that the broker currently uses. |
| InactiveDurableTopicSubscribersCount | Count | The number of inactive durable topic subscribers, up to a maximum of 2000.  |
| JobSchedulerStorePercentUsage | Percent | The percentage of disk space used by the job scheduler store. |
| JournalFilesForFastRecovery | Count | The number of journal files that will be replayed after a clean shutdown. |
| JournalFilesForFullRecovery | Count | The number of journal files that will be replayed after an unclean shutdown. |
| MqttMaximumConnections | Count | The maximum number of clients you can connect to your broker using MQTT. For more information on connection quotas, see [Quotas in Amazon MQ](amazon-mq-limits.md). |
| NetworkConnectorConnectionCount | Count | The number of nodes connected to the broker in a [network of brokers](network-of-brokers.md) using NetworkConnector. |
| NetworkIn | Bytes | The volume of incoming traffic for the broker. |
| NetworkOut | Bytes | The volume of outgoing traffic for the broker. |
| OpenTransactionCount | Count | The total number of transactions in progress. |
| OpenwireMaximumConnections | Count | The maximum number of clients you can connect to your broker using OpenWire. For more information on connection quotas, see [Quotas in Amazon MQ](amazon-mq-limits.md). |
| StompMaximumConnections | Count | The maximum number of clients you can connect to your broker using STOMP. For more information on connection quotas, see [Quotas in Amazon MQ](amazon-mq-limits.md). |
| StorePercentUsage | Percent | The percent used by the storage limit. If this reaches 100, the broker will refuse messages. |
| TempPercentUsage | Percent | The percentage of available temporary storage used by non-persistent messages.  |
| TotalConsumerCount | Count | The number of message consumers subscribed to destinations on the current broker. |
| TotalMessageCount | Count | The number of messages stored on the broker. |
| TotalProducerCount | Count | The number of message producers active on destinations on the current broker. |
| VolumeReadOps | Count | The number of read operations performed on the Amazon EBS volume. |
| VolumeWriteOps | Count | The number of write operations performed on the Amazon EBS volume. |
| WsMaximumConnections | Count | The maximum number of clients you can connect to your broker using WebSocket. For more information on connection quotas, see [Quotas in Amazon MQ](amazon-mq-limits.md). |

### Dimensions for ActiveMQ broker metrics
<a name="security-logging-monitoring-cloudwatch-dimensions"></a>

| Dimension | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Broker | The name of the brokerA single-instance broker has the suffix -1. An active/standby broker for high availability has the suffixes -1 and -2 for its redundant pair. |

## ActiveMQ destination (queue and topic) metrics
<a name="security-logging-monitoring-cloudwatch-destination-metrics"></a>

**Important**
The following metrics include per-minute counts for the CloudWatch polling period.
`EnqueueCount`
`ExpiredCount`
`DequeueCount`
`DispatchCount`
`InFlightCount`
For example, in a five-minute [CloudWatch period](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#CloudWatchPeriods), `EnqueueCount` has five count values, each for a one-minute portion of the period. The `Minimum` and `Maximum` statistics provide the lowest and highest per-minute value during the specified period.

| Metric | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ConsumerCount | Count | The number of consumers subscribed to the destination. |
| EnqueueCount | Count | The number of messages sent to the destination, per minute. |
| EnqueueTime | Time (milliseconds) | The end-to-end latency from when a message arrives at a broker until it is delivered to a consumer. `EnqueueTime` does not measure the end-to-end latency from when a message is sent by a producer until it reaches the broker, nor the latency from when a message is received by a broker until it is acknowledged by the broker. Rather, `EnqueueTime` is the number of milliseconds from the moment a message is received by the broker until it is successfully delivered to a consumer.   |
| ExpiredCount | Count | The number of messages that couldn't be delivered because they expired, per minute. |
| DispatchCount | Count | The number of messages sent to consumers, per minute. |
| DequeueCount | Count | The number of messages acknowledged by consumers, per minute. |
| InFlightCount | Count | The number of messages sent to consumers that have not been acknowledged. |
| ReceiveCount | Count | The number of messages that have been received from the remote broker for a duplex network connector. |
| MemoryUsage | Percent | The percentage of the memory limit that the destination currently uses. |
| ProducerCount | Count | The number of producers for the destination. |
| QueueSize | Count | The number of messages in the queue. This metric applies only to queues.  |
| TotalEnqueueCount | Count | The total number of messages that have been sent to the broker. |
| TotalDequeueCount | Count | The total number of messages that have been consumed by clients. |

**Note**
`TotalEnqueueCount` and `TotalDequeueCount` metrics include messages for advisory topics. For more information about advisory topic messages, see the [ActiveMQ documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/advisory-message.html).
