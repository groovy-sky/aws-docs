# Rebooting an Amazon MQ broker

To apply a new configuration to a broker, you can reboot the broker.

###### Note

If your ActiveMQ broker becomes unresponsive, you can reboot it to recover from a faulty
state.

The following example shows how you can reboot an Amazon MQ broker using the
AWS Management Console.

## To Reboot an Amazon MQ Broker

1. Sign in to the [Amazon MQ console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq).

2. From the broker list, choose the name of your broker (for example, **MyBroker**).

3. On the **`MyBroker`** page, choose
    **Actions**, **Reboot broker**.

###### Important

Single instance brokers will be offline while being rebooted. Cluster brokers will be available, but each node is rebooted one at a time.

4. In the **Reboot broker** dialog box, choose **Reboot**.

Rebooting a broker takes about 5 minutes. If the reboot includes instance size changes or is performed on a broker with high queue depth, the rebooting process can take longer.
