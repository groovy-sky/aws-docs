# Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ broker instance types
<a name="broker-instance-types"></a>

The combined description of the broker instance *class* (`m5`) and *size* (`large`, `medium`) is called the *broker instance type* (for example, `mq.m5.large`). The following table lists the available Amazon MQ broker instance types for ActiveMQ brokers.

Amazon MQ provides at least a 90 day notice before an instance type reaches end of support. We recommend upgrading your broker to a new instance type before the end-of-support date to prevent any disruptions.

**Important**
You cannot create brokers on `t2.micro` or `mq.m4.large` after March 17, 2025.

| mq.t3.micro | 2 | 1 |  Evaluation  | EFS |  |
| mq.m5.large | 2 | 8 | Production | EFS or EBS |  |
| mq.m5.xlarge | 4 | 16 | Production | EFS or EBS |   |
| mq.m5.2xlarge | 8 | 32 | Production | EFS or EBS |   |
