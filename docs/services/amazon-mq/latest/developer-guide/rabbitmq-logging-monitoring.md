# Available CloudWatch metrics for Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ brokers

## RabbitMQ broker metrics

MetricUnitDescription`ExchangeCount`CountThe total number of exchanges configured on the broker.`QueueCount`CountThe total number of queues configured on the broker.`ConnectionCount`CountThe total number of connections established on the broker.`ChannelCount`CountThe total number of channels established on the broker.`ConsumerCount`CountThe total number of consumers connected to the broker.`MessageCount`CountThe total number of messages in the queues.

###### Note

The number produced is the total sum of ready and unacknowledged messages on the
broker.

`MessageReadyCount`CountThe total number of ready messages in the queues.`MessageUnacknowledgedCount`CountThe total number of unacknowledged messages in the queues.`PublishRate`CountThe rate at which messages are published to the broker.

The number produced represents the number of messages per second at the time of sampling.

`ConfirmRate`CountThe rate at which the RabbitMQ server is confirming published messages. You can compare this metric with `PublishRate` to better understand
how your broker is performing.

The number produced represents the number of messages per second at the time of sampling.

`AckRate`CountThe rate at which messages are being acknowledged by consumers.

The number produced represents the number of messages per second at the time of sampling.

`SystemCpuUtilization`PercentThe percentage of allocated Amazon EC2 compute units that the broker currently uses. For cluster deployments, this value represents the aggregate of all three RabbitMQ nodes' corresponding metric values.`RabbitMQMemLimit`BytesThe RAM limit for a RabbitMQ broker. For cluster deployments, this value represents the aggregate of all three RabbitMQ nodes' corresponding metric values.`RabbitMQMemUsed`BytesThe volume of RAM used by a RabbitMQ broker. For cluster deployments, this value represents the aggregate of all three RabbitMQ nodes' corresponding metric values.`RabbitMQDiskFreeLimit`BytesThe disk limit for a RabbitMQ broker. For cluster deployments, this value represents the aggregate of all three RabbitMQ nodes' corresponding metric values. This metric is different per instance size. `RabbitMQDiskFree`BytesThe total volume of free disk space available in a RabbitMQ broker.
When disk usage goes above its limit, the cluster will block all producer connections. For cluster deployments, this value represents the aggregate of all three RabbitMQ nodes' corresponding metric values.`RabbitMQFdUsed`CountNumber of file descriptors used. For cluster deployments, this value represents the aggregate of all three RabbitMQ nodes' corresponding metric values.`RabbitMQIOReadAverageTime`CountThe average time (in milliseconds) for RabbitMQ to perform one read operation. The value is proportional to the message size.`RabbitMQIOWriteAverageTime`CountThe average time (in milliseconds) for RabbitMQ to perform one write operation. The value is proportional to the message size.

## Dimensions for RabbitMQ broker metrics

DimensionDescription`Broker`

The name of the broker.

## RabbitMQ node metrics

MetricUnitDescription`SystemCpuUtilization`PercentThe percentage of allocated Amazon EC2 compute units that the broker currently uses.`RabbitMQMemLimit`BytesThe RAM limit for a RabbitMQ node.`RabbitMQMemUsed`BytesThe volume of RAM used by a RabbitMQ node.
When memory use goes above the limit, the cluster will block all producer connections.`RabbitMQDiskFreeLimit`BytesThe disk limit for a RabbitMQ node. This metric is different per instance size.`RabbitMQDiskFree`BytesThe total volume of free disk space available in a RabbitMQ node.
When disk usage goes above its limit, the cluster will block all producer connections.`RabbitMQFdUsed`CountNumber of file descriptors used.

## Dimensions for RabbitMQ node metrics

DimensionDescription`Node`The name of the node.

###### Note

A node name consists of two parts: a prefix (usuallly `rabbit`)
and a hostname. For example, `rabbit@ip-10-0-0-230.us-west-2.compute.internal` is a node name with
the prefix `rabbit` and the hostname `ip-10-0-0-230.us-west-2.compute.internal`.

`Broker`

The name of the broker.

## RabbitMQ queue metrics

MetricUnitDescription`ConsumerCount`CountThe number of consumers subscribed to the queue.`MessageReadyCount`CountThe number of messages that are currently available to be delivered.`MessageUnacknowledgedCount`CountThe number of messages for which the server is awaiting acknowledgement.`MessageCount`CountThe total number of `MessageReadyCount` and `MessageUnacknowledgedCount` (also known as
queue depth).

###### Note

Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ will not publish metrics for virtual hosts and queues with names containing blank spaces, tabs or other non-ASCII characters.

For more information about dimension names, see
[Dimension](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_Dimension.html#API_Dimension_Contents) in the _Amazon CloudWatch API Reference_.

DimensionDescription`Queue`The name of the queue.`VirtualHost`The name of the virtual host.`Broker`The name of the broker.

## RabbitMQ network metrics

MetricUnitDescription`NetworkOut`Bytes

The number of bytes sent out by the instance on all network interfaces.
This metric identifies the volume of outgoing network traffic from a single instance.
The number reported is the number of bytes sent during the period.
If you are using basic (5-minute) monitoring and the statistic is Sum,
you can divide this number by 300 to find Bytes/second.
If you have detailed (1-minute) monitoring and the statistic is Sum,
divide it by 60.
You can also use the CloudWatch metric math function `DIFF_TIME`
to find the bytes per second.
For example, if you have graphed NetworkOut in CloudWatch as `m1`,
the metric math formula `m1/(DIFF_TIME(m1))` returns the metric in bytes/second.
For more information about `DIFF_TIME` and other metric math functions,
see [Using metric math](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html).

**Meaningful Statistics:** Sum, Average, Minimum, Maximum

`NetworkIn`Bytes

The number of bytes received by the instance on all network interfaces.
This metric identifies the volume of incoming network traffic to a single instance.
The number reported is the number of bytes received during the period.
If you are using basic (5-minute) monitoring and the statistic is Sum,
you can divide this number by 300 to find Bytes/second.
If you have detailed (1-minute) monitoring and the statistic is Sum,
divide it by 60.
You can also use the CloudWatch metric math function `DIFF_TIME`
to find the bytes per second.
For example, if you have graphed NetworkIn in CloudWatch as `m1`,
the metric math formula `m1/(DIFF_TIME(m1))` returns the metric in bytes/second.
For more information about `DIFF_TIME` and other metric math functions,
see [Using metric math](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html).

## Configuring Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ logs

When you enable CloudWatch logging for your RabbitMQ brokers, Amazon MQ uses a service-linked role to publish general logs to CloudWatch.
If no Amazon MQ service-linked role exists when you first create a broker, Amazon MQ will automatically create one. All subsequent
RabbitMQ brokers will use the same service-linked role to publish logs to CloudWatch.

For more information about service-linked roles,
see [Using service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html)
in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide_.
For more information about how Amazon MQ uses service-linked roles, see [Using service-linked roles for Amazon MQ](using-service-linked-roles.md).
