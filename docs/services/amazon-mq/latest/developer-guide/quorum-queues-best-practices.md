# Best practices for quorum queues for Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ

We recommend using the following best practices to improve performance when working with quorum queues.

## Handling poison messages by setting a delivery limit

Poison messages occur when a message fails and is redelivered multiple times.
You can set a message delivery limit using the `delivery-limit` policy argument to drop messages that are redelivered multiple times.
If a message is redelivered more times than the delivery limit allows, the message is then dropped and deleted by RabbitMQ.
When you set a delivery limit, the message is requeued near the head of the queue.

## Message priority for quorum queues

Quorum queues do not have message priority. If you need message priority,
you must create multiple quorum queues.
For more information on prioritizing messages with multiple quorum queues,
see [Message priority](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/quorum-queues) in the RabbitMQ documentation.

## Using the default replication factor

Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ defaults to a replication factor of three (3) nodes for cluster brokers using quorum queues.
If you make changes to `x-quorum-initial-group-size`, Amazon MQ will default again to the replication
factor of 3.
