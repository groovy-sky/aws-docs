# Creating an ActiveMQ broker user

An ActiveMQ _user_ is a person or an application that can access the queues and topics of an ActiveMQ broker.
You can configure users to have specific permissions. For example, you can allow some users to access the [ActiveMQ Web Console](http://activemq.apache.org/web-console.html).

A _group_ is a semantic label. You can assign a group to a user and configure permissions for groups to send to, receive from, and administer specific queues and topics.

###### Note

You can't configure groups independently of users. A group label is created when you add at least one user to it and deleted when you remove all users from it.

###### Note

The `activemq-webconsole` group in ActiveMQ on Amazon MQ has admin permissions on all queues and topics.
All users in this group will have admin access.

The following examples show how you can create, edit, and delete Amazon MQ broker users
using the AWS Management Console.

## Create a new ActiveMQ broker user

1. Sign in to the [Amazon MQ console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq).

2. From the broker list, choose the name of your broker (for example, **MyBroker**)
    and then choose **View details**.

On the **`MyBroker`** page, in the **Users** section, all the users for this broker are listed.

3. Choose **Create user**.

4. In the **Create user** dialog box, type a
    **Username** and **Password**.

5. (Optional) Type the names of groups to which the user belongs, separated
    by commas (for example: `Devs, Admins`).

6. (Optional) To enable the user to access the [ActiveMQ Web\
    Console](http://activemq.apache.org/web-console.html), choose **ActiveMQ Web**
**Console**.

7. Choose **Create user**.

###### Important

Making changes to a user does _not_ apply the changes to the user immediately.
To apply your changes, you must wait for the next maintenance window
or [reboot the broker](amazon-mq-rebooting-broker.md).
