# Amazon ECS API failure reasons

When an API action that you have triggered through the Amazon ECS API, console, or the
AWS CLI exits with a `failures` error message, the following might assist in
troubleshooting the cause. The failure returns a reason and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
resource associated with the failure.

Many resources are Region-specific, so when using the console ensure that you set the
correct Region for your resources. When using the AWS CLI, make sure that your AWS CLI
commands are being sent to the correct Region with the `--region
                    region` parameter.

For more information about the structure of the `Failure` data type, see
[Failure](../../../../reference/amazonecs/latest/apireference/api-failure.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference_.

The following are examples of failure messages that you might receive when running API
commands.

API action

Failure reason or Stopped reason
Cause

`DescribeClusters`

`MISSING`

The specified cluster wasn't found. Verify the spelling of the
cluster name.

`DescribeInstances`

`MISSING`

The specified container instance wasn't found. Verify that you
specified the cluster the container instance is registered to and
that both the container instance ARN or ID is correct.

`DescribeServices`

`MISSING`

The specified service wasn't found. Verify that the correct
cluster or Region is specified and that the service ARN or name is
valid.

`DescribeTasks`

`MISSING`

The specified task wasn't found. Verify the correct cluster or
Region is specified and that both the task ARN or ID is
valid.

`DescribeTasks`

`TaskFailedToStart: RESOURCE:*`

For `RESOURCE:CPU` errors, the number of CPUs requested
by the task are unavailable on your container instances. This
generally happens when the CPU unit requirement in your task
definition is larger than the CPU size of the Amazon EC2 instances defined
in the Auto Scaling group mapped to the capacity provider. You need to check
your capacity provider configuration.

For `RESOURCE:MEMORY` errors, the amount of memory
requested by the task are unavailable on your container instances.
This generally happens when the memory amount requirement in your
task definition is larger than the supported memory on the Amazon EC2
instances defined in the Auto Scaling group mapped to the capacity provider.
You need to check your capacity provider configuration.

`TaskFailedToStart: AGENT`

The container instance that you attempted to launch a task onto
has an agent that's currently disconnected. To prevent extended wait
times for task placement, the request was rejected.

For information about how to troubleshoot an agent that's
disconnected, see [How do I troubleshoot a disconnected Amazon ECS\
agent](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/ecs-agent-disconnected-linux2-ami).

`TaskFailedToStart: MemberOf placement constraint
                                    unsatisfied`

There is no container instance that meets the placement
constraints defined in your task definition.

`TaskFailedToStart: ATTRIBUTE`

Your task definition contains a parameter that requires a specific
container instance attribute that isn't available on your container
instances. For example, if your task uses the `awsvpc`
network mode, but there are no instances in your specified subnets
with the `ecs.capability.task-eni` attribute. For more
information about which attributes are required for specific task
definition parameters and agent configuration variables, see [Amazon ECS task definition parameters for Fargate](task-definition-parameters.md) and [Amazon ECS container agent configuration](ecs-agent-config.md).

`TaskFailedToStart: NO ACTIVE INSTANCES`There are no active instances in your capacity provider. For information about
how to manage your Auto Scaling groups, see [Auto Scaling\
groups](../../../autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-groups.md) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User_
_Guide_.

`TaskFailedToStart: EMPTY CAPACITY PROVIDER`

There are no instances in your cluster. This is most likely because
of an empty capacity provider, or because the instances in the capacity
provider are not registered to the cluster. For information about
how to manage your Auto Scaling groups, see [Auto Scaling\
groups](../../../autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-groups.md) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User_
_Guide_.

`GetTaskProtection`

`MISSING`

The specified task wasn't found. Verify that the cluster name or
ARN and the task ARN or ID are valid.

`TASK_NOT_VALID`

The specified task isn't part of an Amazon ECS service. Only Amazon ECS
service-managed tasks can be protected. Verify the task ARN or ID
and try again.

`RunTask` or `StartTask`

`RESOURCE:*`

The resource or resources that are requested by the task are
unavailable on the container instances in the cluster. If the
resource is CPU, memory, ports, or elastic network interfaces, you
might need to add additional container instances to your
cluster.

For `RESOURCE:ENI` errors, your cluster doesn't have
any available elastic network interface attachment points, which are
required for tasks that use the `awsvpc` network mode.
Amazon EC2 instances have a limit to the number of network interfaces
that can be attached to them, and the primary network interface
counts as one. For more information about how many network
interfaces are supported for each instance type, see [IP\
Addresses Per Network Interface Per Instance Type](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-eni.md#AvailableIpPerENI) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

For `RESOURCE:GPU` errors, the number of
GPUs requested by the task are unavailable and you might need to add
GPU-enabled container instances to your cluster. For more
information, see [Amazon ECS task definitions for GPU workloads](ecs-gpu.md).

`AGENT`

The container instance that you attempted to launch a task onto
has an agent that's currently disconnected. To prevent extended wait
times for task placement, the request was rejected.

For information about how to troubleshoot an agent that's
disconnected, see [How do I troubleshoot a disconnected Amazon ECS\
agent](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/ecs-agent-disconnected-linux2-ami).

`LOCATION`

The container instance that you attempted to launch a task onto is
in a different Availability Zone than the subnets that you specified
in your `awsVpcConfiguration`.

`ATTRIBUTE`

Your task definition contains a parameter that requires a specific
container instance attribute that isn't available on your container
instances. For example, if your task uses the `awsvpc`
network mode, but there are no instances in your specified subnets
with the `ecs.capability.task-eni` attribute. For more
information about which attributes are required for specific task
definition parameters and agent configuration variables, see [Amazon ECS task definition parameters for Fargate](task-definition-parameters.md) and [Amazon ECS container agent configuration](ecs-agent-config.md).

`StartTask`

`MISSING`

The container instance that you attempted to launch the task onto
can't be found. Check if the wrong cluster or Region is specified, or
the container instance ARN or ID is misspelled.

`INACTIVE`

The container instance that you attempted to launch a task onto
was previously deregistered with Amazon ECS and can't be used.

`StopServiceDeployment`

`ECS deployment failed`

A fraud account ran the `StopServiceDeployment`
API.

`TagResource`

`InvalidParameterException`

The ARN for the service that you are tagging has the short format. You
must migrate to the long format. For information about how to migrate the
ARN, see [Migrate an Amazon ECS short service ARN to a long ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-arn-migration.html).

`UpdateTaskProtection`

`DEPLOYMENT_BLOCKED`

Can't set task protection as one or more protected tasks are
preventing the service deployment from reaching a steady state.
Unset task protection on existing tasks or wait until task
protection expires.

`MISSING`

The specified task wasn't found. Verify that the cluster name or
ARN and the task ARN or ID are valid.

`TASK_NOT_VALID`

The specified task isn't part of an Amazon ECS service. Only Amazon ECS
service-managed tasks can be protected. Verify the task ARN or ID
and try again.

###### Note

Besides the failure scenarios described here, API operations can also fail due to
exceptions, resulting in error responses. For a list of such exceptions, see [Common Errors](../../../../reference/amazonecs/latest/apireference/commonerrors.md).
