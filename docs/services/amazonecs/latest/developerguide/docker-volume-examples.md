# Docker volume examples for Amazon ECS

The following examples show how to provide ephemeral storage for a container and how
to provide a shared volume for multiple containers, and how to provide NFS persistent
storage for a container.

###### To provide ephemeral storage for a container using a Docker volume

In this example, a container uses an empty data volume that is disposed of
after the task is finished. One example use case is that you might have a
container that needs to access some scratch file storage location during a task.
This task can be achieved using a Docker volume.

1. In the task definition `volumes` section, define a data volume
    with `name` and `DockerVolumeConfiguration` values. In
    this example, we specify the scope as `task` so the volume is
    deleted after the task stops and use the built-in `local`
    driver.

```nohighlight

"volumes": [
       {
           "name": "scratch",
           "dockerVolumeConfiguration" : {
               "scope": "task",
               "driver": "local",
               "labels": {
                   "scratch": "space"
               }
           }
       }
]
```

2. In the `containerDefinitions` section, define a container with
    `mountPoints` values that reference the name of the defined
    volume and the `containerPath` value to mount the volume at on
    the container.

```nohighlight

"containerDefinitions": [
       {
           "name": "container-1",
           "mountPoints": [
               {
                 "sourceVolume": "scratch",
                 "containerPath": "/var/scratch"
               }
           ]
       }
]
```

###### To provide persistent storage for multiple containers using a Docker volume

In this example, you want a shared volume for multiple containers to use and
you want it to persist after any single task that use it stopped. The built-in
`local` driver is being used. This is so the volume is still tied
to the lifecycle of the container instance.

1. In the task definition `volumes` section, define a data volume
    with `name` and `DockerVolumeConfiguration` values. In
    this example, specify a `shared` scope so the volume persists,
    set autoprovision to `true`. This is so that the volume is
    created for use. Then, also use the built-in `local`
    driver.

```nohighlight

"volumes": [
       {
           "name": "database",
           "dockerVolumeConfiguration" : {
               "scope": "shared",
               "autoprovision": true,
               "driver": "local",
               "labels": {
                   "database": "database_name"
               }
           }
       }
]
```

2. In the `containerDefinitions` section, define a container with
    `mountPoints` values that reference the name of the defined
    volume and the `containerPath` value to mount the volume at on
    the container.

```nohighlight

"containerDefinitions": [
       {
           "name": "container-1",
           "mountPoints": [
           {
             "sourceVolume": "database",
             "containerPath": "/var/database"
           }
         ]
       },
       {
         "name": "container-2",
         "mountPoints": [
           {
             "sourceVolume": "database",
             "containerPath": "/var/database"
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
```

###### To provide NFS persistent storage for a container using a Docker volume

In this example, a container uses an NFS data volume that is automatically
mounted when the task starts and unmounted when the task stops. This uses the
Docker built-in `local` driver. One example use case is that you
might have a local NFS storage and need to access it from an ECS Anywhere task.
This can be achieved using a Docker volume with NFS driver option.

1. In the task definition `volumes` section, define a data volume
    with `name` and `DockerVolumeConfiguration` values. In
    this example, specify a `task` scope so the volume is unmounted
    after the task stops. Use the `local` driver and configure the
    `driverOpts` with the `type`, `device`,
    and `o` options accordingly. Replace `NFS_SERVER` with
    the NFS server endpoint.

```nohighlight

"volumes": [
          {
              "name": "NFS",
              "dockerVolumeConfiguration" : {
                  "scope": "task",
                  "driver": "local",
                  "driverOpts": {
                      "type": "nfs",
                      "device": "$NFS_SERVER:/mnt/nfs",
                      "o": "addr=$NFS_SERVER"
                  }
              }
          }
      ]
```

2. In the `containerDefinitions` section, define a container with
    `mountPoints` values that reference the name of the defined
    volume and the `containerPath` value to mount the volume on the
    container.

```nohighlight

"containerDefinitions": [
          {
              "name": "container-1",
              "mountPoints": [
                  {
                    "sourceVolume": "NFS",
                    "containerPath": "/var/nfsmount"
                  }
              ]
          }
      ]
```
