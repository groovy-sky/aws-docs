# Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS

Amazon Elastic Container Service uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) [service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role). A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is
linked directly to Amazon ECS. Service-linked roles are predefined by Amazon ECS and
include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your
behalf.
