# Creating a container image for use on Amazon ECS

Amazon ECS uses Docker images in task definitions to launch containers. Docker is a technology
that provides the tools for you to build, run, test, and deploy distributed applications in
containers.

Amazon ECS schedules containerized applications on to container instances or on to AWS Fargate.
Containerized applications are packaged as container images. This example creates a
container image for a web server.

You can create your first Docker image, and then push that image to Amazon ECR, which is a
container registry, for use in your Amazon ECS task definitions. This walkthrough assumes that
you possess a basic understanding of what Docker is and how it works. For more information
about Docker, see [What is Docker?](http://aws.amazon.com/docker) and the
[Docker\
documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-overview).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following prerequisites are met.

- Ensure you have completed the Amazon ECR setup steps. For more information, see
[Moving an image through its lifecycle in Amazon ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/getting-started-cli.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide_.

- Your user has the required IAM permissions to access and use the Amazon ECR
service. For more information, see [Amazon ECR managed\
policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html).

- You have Docker installed. For Docker installation steps for Amazon Linux 2023, see
[Installing Docker on AL2023](#create-container-image-install-docker). For all other
operating systems, see the Docker documentation at [Docker Desktop\
overview](https://docs.docker.com/desktop).

- You have the AWS CLI installed and configured. For more information, see [Installing or updating to the\
latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) in the
_AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

If you don't have or need a local development environment and you prefer to use an
Amazon EC2 instance to use Docker, we provide the following steps to launch an Amazon EC2 instance
using Amazon Linux 2023 and install Docker Engine and the Docker CLI.

Docker is available on many different operating systems, including most modern
Linux distributions, like Ubuntu, and even macOS and Windows. For more information
about how to install Docker on your particular operating system, go to the [Docker\
installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation).

You do not need a local development system to use Docker. If you are using Amazon EC2
already, you can launch an Amazon Linux 2023 instance and install Docker to get
started.

If you already have Docker installed, skip to [Create a Docker image](#create-container-image-create-image).

###### To install Docker on an Amazon EC2 instance using an Amazon Linux 2023 AMI

1. Launch an instance with the latest Amazon Linux 2023 AMI. For more
    information, see [Launch an EC2 instance using the launch instance wizard in the console](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md) in the
    _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

2. Connect to your instance. For more information, see [Connect to your EC2\
    instance](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/connect.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

3. Update the installed packages and package cache on your instance.

```nohighlight

sudo yum update -y
```

4. Install the most recent Docker Community Edition package.

```nohighlight

sudo yum install docker
```

5. Start the Docker service.

```nohighlight

sudo service docker start
```

6. Add the `ec2-user` to the `docker` group so you can
    execute Docker commands without using `sudo`.

```nohighlight

sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
```

7. Log out and log back in again to pick up the new `docker` group
    permissions. You can accomplish this by closing your current SSH terminal
    window and reconnecting to your instance in a new one. Your new SSH session
    will have the appropriate `docker` group permissions.

8. Verify that the `ec2-user` can run Docker commands without
    `sudo`.

```nohighlight

docker info
```

###### Note

In some cases, you may need to reboot your instance to provide
permissions for the `ec2-user` to access the Docker daemon.
Try rebooting your instance if you see the following error:

```

Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?
```

## Create a Docker image

Amazon ECS task definitions use container images to launch containers on the container
instances in your clusters. In this section, you create a Docker image of a simple web
application, and test it on your local system or Amazon EC2 instance, and then push the image
to the Amazon ECR container registry so you can use it in an Amazon ECS task definition.

###### To create a Docker image of a simple web application

1. Create a file called `Dockerfile`. A Dockerfile is a
    manifest that describes the base image to use for your Docker image and what you
    want installed and running on it. For more information about Dockerfiles, go to
    the [Dockerfile\
    Reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile).

```nohighlight

touch Dockerfile
```

2. Edit the `Dockerfile` you just created and add the
    following content.

```Bash/Shell

FROM public.ecr.aws/amazonlinux/amazonlinux:latest

# Update installed packages and install Apache
RUN yum update -y && \
    yum install -y httpd

# Write hello world message
RUN echo 'Hello World!' > /var/www/html/index.html

# Configure Apache
RUN echo 'mkdir -p /var/run/httpd' >> /root/run_apache.sh && \
    echo 'mkdir -p /var/lock/httpd' >> /root/run_apache.sh && \
    echo '/usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND' >> /root/run_apache.sh && \
    chmod 755 /root/run_apache.sh

EXPOSE 80

CMD /root/run_apache.sh
```

This Dockerfile uses the public Amazon Linux 2023 image hosted on Amazon ECR Public. The
    `RUN` instructions update the package caches, installs some
    software packages for the web server, and then write the "Hello World!" content
    to the web servers document root. The `EXPOSE` instruction means that
    port 80 on the container is the one that is listening, and the `CMD`
    instruction starts the web server.

3. Build the Docker image from your Dockerfile.

###### Note

Some versions of Docker may require the full path to your Dockerfile in
the following command, instead of the relative path shown below.

If you run the command an ARM based system, such as [Apple Silicon](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/116943), use
the --platform option "--platform linux/amd64".

```nohighlight

docker build -t hello-world .
```

4. List your container image.

```nohighlight

docker images --filter reference=hello-world
```

Output:

```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hello-world         latest              e9ffedc8c286        4 minutes ago       194MB
```

5. Run the newly built image. The `-p 80:80` option maps the exposed
    port 80 on the container to port 80 on the host system.

```nohighlight

docker run -t -i -p 80:80 hello-world
```

###### Note

Output from the Apache web server is displayed in the terminal window. You
can ignore the " `Could not reliably determine the fully
                               qualified domain name`" message.

6. Open a browser and point to the server that is running Docker and hosting your
    container.

- If you are using an EC2 instance, this is the **Public**
**DNS** value for the server, which is the same address you
use to connect to the instance with SSH. Make sure that the security
group for your instance allows inbound traffic on port 80.

- If you are running Docker locally, point your browser to [http://localhost/](http://localhost/).

You should see a web page with your "Hello World!" statement.

7. Stop the Docker container by typing **Ctrl + c**.

## Push your image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry

Amazon ECR is a managed AWS managed image registry service. You can use the Docker CLI to push,
pull, and manage images in your Amazon ECR repositories. For Amazon ECR product details, featured
customer case studies, and FAQs, see the [Amazon Elastic Container Registry\
product detail pages](http://aws.amazon.com/ecr).

###### To tag your image and push it to Amazon ECR

1. Create an Amazon ECR repository to store your `hello-world` image. Note
    the `repositoryUri` in the output.

Substitute `region`, with your AWS Region, for example,
    `us-east-1`.

```nohighlight

aws ecr create-repository --repository-name hello-repository --region region
```

Output:

```replaceable
{
       "repository": {
           "registryId": "aws_account_id",
           "repositoryName": "hello-repository",
           "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:region:aws_account_id:repository/hello-repository",
           "createdAt": 1505337806.0,
           "repositoryUri": "aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/hello-repository"
       }
}
```

2. Tag the `hello-world` image with the `repositoryUri`
    value from the previous step.

```nohighlight

docker tag hello-world aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/hello-repository
```

3. Run the **aws ecr get-login-password** command. Specify the
    registry URI you want to authenticate to. For more information, see [Registry\
    Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Registries.html#registry_auth) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide_.

```nohighlight

aws ecr get-login-password --region region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com
```

Output:

```
Login Succeeded
```

###### Important

If you receive an error, install or upgrade to the latest version of the
AWS CLI. For more information, see [Installing or updating to the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) in the
_AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

4. Push the image to Amazon ECR with the `repositoryUri` value from the
    earlier step.

```nohighlight

docker push aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/hello-repository
```

## Clean up

To continue on with creating an Amazon ECS task definition and launching a task with your
container image, skip to the [Next steps](#create-container-image-next-steps). When you are done experimenting
with your Amazon ECR image, you can delete the repository so you are not charged for image
storage.

```nohighlight

aws ecr delete-repository --repository-name hello-repository --region region --force
```

## Next steps

Your task definitions require a task execution role. For more information, see [Amazon ECS task execution IAM role](task-execution-iam-role.md).

After you have created and pushed your container image to Amazon ECR, you can use that
image in a task definition. For more information, see one of the following:
