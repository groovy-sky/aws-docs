# Amazon ECS interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)

You can improve the security posture of your VPC by configuring Amazon ECS to use an interface
VPC endpoint. Interface endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that allows you
to privately access Amazon ECS APIs by using private IP addresses. AWS PrivateLink restricts all
network traffic between your VPC and Amazon ECS to the Amazon network. You don't need an internet
gateway, a NAT device, or a virtual private gateway.

For more information about AWS PrivateLink and VPC endpoints, see [VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/concepts.html#concepts-vpc-endpoints) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

## Considerations

### Considerations for endpoints in Regions introduced starting on December 23, 2023

Before you set up interface VPC endpoints for Amazon ECS, be aware of the following
considerations:

- You must have the following Region-specific VPC
endpoints:

###### Note

If you do not configure all of the endpoints, your traffic will go
over the public endpoints, not your VPC endpoint.

- `com.amazonaws.region.ecs-agent`

- `com.amazonaws.region.ecs-telemetry`

- `com.amazonaws.region.ecs`

For example, the Canada West (Calgary) (ca-west-1) Region
needs the following VPC endpoints:

- `com.amazonaws.ca-west-1.ecs-agent`

- `com.amazonaws.ca-west-1.ecs-telemetry`

- `com.amazonaws.ca-west-1.ecs`

- When you use a template to create AWS resources in the new
Region and the template was copied from a
Region introduced before December 23, 2023, depending on the
copy-from Region, perform one of the following
operations.

For example, the copy-from Region is US East (N. Virginia)
(us-east-1). The copy-to Region is
Canada West (Calgary) (ca-west-1).

ConfigurationAction

The copied-from Region does not have
any VPC endpoints.

Create all three VPC endpoints for the new
Region (for example,
`com.amazonaws.ca-west-1.ecs-agent`).

The copied-from Region contains
Region-specific VPC endpoints.

1. Create all three VPC endpoints for the new
    Region (for example,
    `com.amazonaws.ca-west-1.ecs-agent`).

2. Delete all three VPC endpoints for the
    copy-from Region (for example,
    `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.ecs-agent`).

### Considerations for Amazon ECS VPC endpoints for Fargate

When there is an VPC endpoint for `ecr.dkr` and `ecr.api` in
the same VPC where a Fargate task is deployed into, it will use the VPC endpoint.
If there is no VPC endpoint, it will use the Fargate interface.

Before you set up interface VPC endpoints for Amazon ECS, be aware of the following
considerations:

- Tasks using Fargate don't require the
interface VPC endpoints for Amazon ECS, but you might need interface VPC
endpoints for Amazon ECR, Secrets Manager, or Amazon CloudWatch Logs described in the following
points.

- To allow your tasks to pull private images from Amazon ECR, you must
create the interface VPC endpoints for Amazon ECR. For more information,
see [Interface VPC\
Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)](../../../amazonecr/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.md) in the
_Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide_.

###### Important

- If you configure Amazon ECR to use an interface VPC
endpoint, you can create a task execution role that
includes condition keys to restrict access to a specific
VPC or VPC endpoint. For more information, see [Fargate tasks pulling Amazon ECR images over interface endpoints permissions](task-execution-iam-role.md#task-execution-ecr-conditionkeys).

- If your tasks are in an IPv6-only configuration and
use an Amazon ECR dualstack image URI, note that Amazon ECR
doesn't support dualstack interface VPC endpoints. For
more information, see [Getting started with making requests over\
IPv6](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ecr-requests.html#ipv6-access-getting-started) in the
_Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide_.

- To allow your tasks to pull sensitive data from Secrets Manager, you must
create the interface VPC endpoints for Secrets Manager. For more information,
see [Using Secrets Manager with VPC Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoint-overview.html) in the
_AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.

- If your VPC doesn't have an internet gateway and your tasks use
the `awslogs` log driver to send log information to
CloudWatch Logs, you must create an interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch Logs. For more
information, see [Using\
CloudWatch Logs with Interface VPC Endpoints](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/cloudwatch-logs-and-interface-vpc.md) in the
_Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide_.

- VPC endpoints currently don't support cross-Region requests. Ensure that
you create your endpoint in the same Region where you plan to issue your API
calls to Amazon ECS. For example, assume that you want to run tasks in
US East (N. Virginia). Then, you must create the Amazon ECS VPC endpoint in
US East (N. Virginia). An Amazon ECS VPC endpoint created in any other region can't
run tasks in US East (N. Virginia).

- VPC endpoints only support Amazon-provided DNS through Amazon Route 53. If you
want to use your own DNS, you can use conditional DNS forwarding. For more
information, see [DHCP\
Options Sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- The security group attached to the VPC endpoint must allow incoming
connections on TCP port 443 from the private subnet of the VPC.

- Service Connect management of the Envoy proxy uses the
`com.amazonaws.region.ecs-agent`
VPC endpoint. When you don't use the VPC endpoints, Service Connect
management of the Envoy proxy uses the `ecs-sc` endpoint in that
Region. For a list of the Amazon ECS endpoints in each Region, see
[Amazon ECS endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ecs-service.html).

### Considerations for Amazon ECS VPC endpoints for EC2

Before you set up interface VPC endpoints for Amazon ECS, be aware of the following
considerations:

- Tasks using EC2 require that the container
instances that they're launched on to run version `1.25.1` or
later of the Amazon ECS container agent. For more information, see [Amazon ECS Linux container instance management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/manage-linux.html).

- To allow your tasks to pull sensitive data from Secrets Manager, you must create the
interface VPC endpoints for Secrets Manager. For more information, see [Using\
Secrets Manager with VPC Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoint-overview.html) in the
_AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.

- If your VPC doesn't have an internet gateway and your tasks use the
`awslogs` log driver to send log information to CloudWatch Logs, you
must create an interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see
[Using\
CloudWatch Logs with Interface VPC Endpoints](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/cloudwatch-logs-and-interface-vpc.md) in the
_Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide_.

- VPC endpoints currently don't support cross-Region requests. Ensure that
you create your endpoint in the same Region where you plan to issue your API
calls to Amazon ECS. For example, assume that you want to run tasks in
US East (N. Virginia). Then, you must create the Amazon ECS VPC endpoint in
US East (N. Virginia). An Amazon ECS VPC endpoint created in any other
Region can't run tasks in US East (N. Virginia).

- VPC endpoints only support Amazon-provided DNS through Amazon Route 53. If you
want to use your own DNS, you can use conditional DNS forwarding. For more
information, see [DHCP\
Options Sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- The security group attached to the VPC endpoint must allow incoming
connections on TCP port 443 from the private subnet of the VPC.

## Understanding Amazon ECS endpoint naming patterns

It's important to understand that the Amazon ECS agent may make requests to endpoints with
numbered suffixes, such as:

- `ecs-a-1.region.amazonaws.com`,
`ecs-a-2.region.amazonaws.com`, etc. for agent endpoints

- `ecs-t-1.region.amazonaws.com`,
`ecs-t-2.region.amazonaws.com`, etc. for telemetry
endpoints

This behavior occurs because the Amazon ECS agent uses the [DiscoverPollEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DiscoverPollEndpoint.html) API to
dynamically determine which specific endpoint to connect to. If your VPC endpoints don't
properly handle these numbered endpoint variations, the agent will fall back to using
public endpoints, even if you've configured VPC endpoints for the base names.

### The role of DiscoverPollEndpoint API

The [DiscoverPollEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DiscoverPollEndpoint.html) API is used by the Amazon ECS agent to discover the
appropriate endpoint to poll for tasks. When the agent calls this API, it receives a
specific endpoint URL that may include a numbered suffix. To ensure your VPC
endpoints work correctly, your network configuration must allow the agent to:

1. Access the DiscoverPollEndpoint API

2. Connect to the returned endpoint URLs, including those with numbered
    suffixes

If you're troubleshooting VPC endpoint connectivity issues, verify that your agent
can reach both the base endpoints and any numbered variations that might be returned
by the DiscoverPollEndpoint API.

## Creating the VPC Endpoints for Amazon ECS

To create the VPC endpoint for the Amazon ECS service, use the [Access an AWS service using an interface VPC endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-interface-endpoint.html#create-interface-endpoint) procedure in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_ to create the following
endpoints. If you have existing container instances within your VPC, you should create
the endpoints in the order that they're listed. If you plan on creating your container
instances after your VPC endpoint is created, the order doesn't matter.

###### Note

If you do not configure all of the endpoints, your traffic will go over the public
endpoints, not your VPC endpoint.

When you create endpoints, Amazon ECS also creates a private DNS name for the endpoint.
For example, `ecs-a.region.amazonaws.com` for ecs-agent and
`ecs-t.region.amazonaws.com` for ecs-telemetry.

- `com.amazonaws.region.ecs-agent`

- `com.amazonaws.region.ecs-telemetry`

- `com.amazonaws.region.ecs`

###### Note

`region` represents the Region identifier for an AWS
Region supported by Amazon ECS, such as `us-east-2` for the
US East (Ohio) Region.

The `ecs-agent` endpoint uses the `ecs:poll` API, and the
`ecs-telemetry` endpoint uses the `ecs:poll` and
`ecs:StartTelemetrySession` API.

If you have existing tasks that are using the EC2 launch type, after you
have created the VPC endpoints, each container instance needs to pick up the new
configuration. For this to happen, you must either reboot each container instance or
restart the Amazon ECS container agent on each container instance. To restart the container
agent, do the following.

###### To restart the Amazon ECS container agent

1. Log in to your container instance via SSH.

2. Stop the container agent.

```

sudo docker stop ecs-agent
```

3. Start the container agent.

```

sudo docker start ecs-agent
```

After you have created the VPC endpoints and restarted the Amazon ECS container agent on
each container instance, all newly launched tasks pick up the new configuration.

## Creating a VPC endpoint policy for Amazon ECS

You can attach an endpoint policy to your VPC endpoint that controls access to Amazon ECS.
The policy specifies the following information:

- The principal that can perform actions.

- The actions that can be performed.

- The resources on which actions can be performed.

For more information, see [Controlling access to\
services with VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-access.html) in the _Amazon VPC User_
_Guide_.

###### Example: VPC endpoint policy for Amazon ECS actions

The following is an example of an endpoint policy for Amazon ECS. When attached to an
endpoint, this policy grants access to permission to create and list clusters. The
`CreateCluster` and `ListClusters` actions do not accept
any resources, so the resource definition is set to \* for all resources.

```

{
   "Statement":[
    {
      "Principal":"*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ecs:CreateCluster",
        "ecs:ListClusters"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```
