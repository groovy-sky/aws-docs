# Creating an Amazon ECS task definition using the console

You create a task definition so that you can define the application that you run as a task or
service.

When you create a task definition for the external launch type, you need to create the task
definition using JSON editor and set the `requireCapabilities` parameter to
`EXTERNAL`.

You can create a task definition by using the console experience, or by specifying a JSON
file. You can have Amazon Q provide recommendations when you use the JSON editor. For more information, see [Using Amazon Q Developer to provide task definition recommendations in the Amazon ECS console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-amazon-q.html)

## JSON validation

The Amazon ECS console JSON editor validates the following in the JSON file:

- The file is a valid JSON file.

- The file doesn't contain any extraneous keys.

- The file contains the `familyName` parameter.

- There is at least one entry under `containerDefinitions`.

## CloudFormation stacks

The following behavior applies to task definitions that were
created in the new Amazon ECS console before January 12, 2023.

When you create a task definition, the Amazon ECS console automatically creates a CloudFormation
stack that has a name that begins with `ECS-Console-V2-TaskDefinition-`. If you used the
AWS CLI or an AWS SDK to deregister the task definition, then you must manually delete the task
definition stack. For more information, see [Deleting a\
stack](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/cfn-console-delete-stack.md) in the _CloudFormation User Guide_.

Task definitions created after January 12, 2023, do not have a CloudFormation stack
automatically created for them.

## Procedure

Amazon ECS console

01. Open the console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Task**
    **definitions**.

03. On the **Create new task definition** menu,
     choose **Create new task definition**.

04. For **Task definition family**, specify a unique
     name for the task definition.

05. For **Launch type**, choose the application
     environment. The console default is
     **AWS Fargate** (which is serverless). Amazon ECS
     uses this value to perform validation to ensure that the task
     definition parameters are valid for the infrastructure type.

06. For **Operating system/Architecture**, choose the
     operating system and CPU architecture for the task.

    To run your task on a 64-bit ARM architecture, choose
     **Linux/ARM64**. For more information, see
     [Runtime platform](task-definition-parameters.md#runtime-platform).

    To run your **AWS Fargate** tasks on Windows
     containers, choose a supported Windows operating system. For more
     information, see [Operating Systems and architectures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/fargate-tasks-services.html#fargate-task-os).

07. For **Task size**, choose the CPU and memory
     values to reserve for the task. The CPU value is specified as vCPUs
     and memory is specified as GB.

    For tasks hosted on Fargate, the following table shows the valid
     CPU and memory combinations.

    CPU value

    8192 (8 vCPU)

    ###### Note

    This option requires Linux platform `1.4.0` or
    later.

    Between 16 GB and 60 GB in 4 GB increments

    Linux

    16384 (16vCPU)

    ###### Note

    This option requires Linux platform `1.4.0` or
    later.

    Between 32 GB and 120 GB in 8 GB increments

    Linux

    For tasks that use EC2 instances, or external instances, the supported task CPU values are between
     128 CPU units (0.125 vCPUs) and 196608 CPU units (192 vCPUs).

    To
     specify the memory value in GB, enter **GB** after
     the value. For example, to set the **Memory value**
     to 3GB, enter **3GB**.

    ###### Note

    Task-level CPU and memory parameters are ignored for Windows
    containers.

08. For **Network mode**, choose the network mode to
     use. The default is **awsvpc** mode. For more
     information, see [Amazon ECS\
     task networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html).

    If you choose **bridge**, under **Port**
    **mappings**, for **Host port**, enter
     the port number on the container instance to reserve for your
     container.

09. (Optional) Expand the **Task roles** section to
     configure the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for the task:
    1. For **Task role**, choose the IAM role
        to assign to the task. A task IAM role provides
        permissions for the containers in a task to call AWS API
        operations.

    2. For **Task execution role**, choose the
        role.

       For information about when to use a task execution role,
        see [Amazon ECS task execution IAM role](task-execution-iam-role.md). If you don't
        need the role, choose **None**.
10. (Optional) Expand the **Task placement** section
     to add placement contraints. Task placement constraints allow you to
     filter the container instances used for the placement of your tasks
     using built-in or custom attributes.

11. (Optional) Expand the **Fault injection** section
     to enable fault injection. Fault injection lets you test how your application
     responds to certain impairment scenarios.

12. For each container to define in your task definition, complete the
     following steps.
    01. For **Name**, enter a name for the
         container.

    02. For **Image URI**, enter the image to use
         to start a container. Images in the Amazon ECR Public Gallery
         registry can be specified by using the Amazon ECR Public registry
         name only. For example, if
         `public.ecr.aws/ecs/amazon-ecs-agent:latest`
         is specified, the Amazon Linux container hosted on the
         Amazon ECR Public Gallery is used. For all other repositories,
         specify the repository by using either the
         `repository-url/image:tag` or
         `repository-url/image@digest` formats.

    03. If your image is in a private registry outside of Amazon ECR,
         under **Private registry**, turn on
         **Private registry authentication**.
         Then, in **Secrets Manager ARN or name**,
         enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.

    04. For **Essential container**, if your task
         definition has two or more containers defined, you can
         specify whether the container should be considered
         essential. When a container is marked as
         **Essential**, if that container stops,
         then the task is stopped. Each task definition must contain
         at least one essential container.

    05. A port mapping allows the container to access ports on the
         host to send or receive traffic. Under **Port**
        **mappings**, do one of the following:

- When you use the **awsvpc**
network mode, for **Container**
**port** and **Protocol**,
choose the port mapping to use for the
container.

- When you use the **bridge**
network mode, for **Container**
**port** and **Protocol**,
choose the port mapping to use for the
container.

Choose **Add more port mappings** to
specify additional container port mappings.

    06. To give the container read-only access to its root file
         system, for **Read only root file system**,
         select **Read only**.

    07. (Optional) To define the container-level CPU, GPU, and
         memory limits that are different from task-level values,
         under **Resource allocation limits**, do
         the following:

- For **CPU**, enter the number of
CPU units that the Amazon ECS container agent reserves
for the container.

- For **GPU**, enter the number of
GPU units for the container instance.

An Amazon EC2 instance with GPU support has 1 GPU unit
for every GPU. For more information, see [Amazon ECS task definitions for GPU workloads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-gpu.html).

- For **Memory hard limit**, enter
the amount of memory, in GB, to present to the
container. If the container attempts to exceed the
hard limit, the container stops.

- The Docker 20.10.0 or later daemon
reserves a minimum of 6 mebibytes (MiB) of memory
for a container, so don't specify fewer than 6 MiB
of memory for your containers.

The Docker 19.03.13-ce or earlier
daemon reserves a minimum of 4 MiB of memory for a
container, so don't specify fewer than 4 MiB of
memory for your containers.

- For **Memory soft limit**, enter
the soft limit (in GB) of memory to reserve for the
container.

When system memory is under contention,
Docker attempts to keep the
container memory to this soft limit. If you don't
specify task-level memory, you must specify a
non-zero integer for one or both of **Memory**
**hard limit** and **Memory soft**
**limit**. If you specify both,
**Memory hard limit** must be
greater than **Memory soft limit**.

This feature is not supported on Windows
containers.

    08. (Optional) Expand the **Environment**
        **variables** section to specify environment
         variables to inject into the container. You can specify
         environment variables either individually by using key-value
         pairs or in bulk by specifying an environment variable file
         that's hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket. For information about how
         to format an environment variable file, see [Pass an individual environment variable to an Amazon ECS container](taskdef-envfiles.md).

        When you specify an environment variable for secret
         storage, for **Key**, enter the secret
         name. Then for **ValueFrom**, enter the
         full ARN of the Systems Manager Parameter Store secret or Secrets Manager
         secret

    09. (Optional) Select the **Use log**
        **collection** option to specify a log
         configuration. For each available log driver, there are log
         driver options to specify. The default option sends
         container logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. The other log driver options
         are configured by using AWS FireLens. For
         more information, see [Send Amazon ECS logs to an AWS service or AWS Partner](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_firelens.html).

        The following describes each container log destination in
         more detail.

- **Amazon CloudWatch** – Configure
the task to send container logs to CloudWatch Logs. The
default log driver options are provided, which
create a CloudWatch log group on your behalf. To specify a
different log group name, change the driver option
values.

- **Export logs to**
**Splunk** –
Configure the task to send container logs to the
Splunk driver that sends the logs
to a remote service. You must enter the URL to your
Splunk web service. The
Splunk token is specified as a
secret option because it can be treated as sensitive
data.

- **Export logs to Amazon Data Firehose**
– Configure the task to send container logs
to Firehose. The default log driver options are
provided, which sends log to an Firehose delivery
stream. To specify a different delivery stream name,
change the driver option values.

- **Export logs to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams**
– Configure the task to send container logs
to Kinesis Data Streams. The default log driver options are
provided, which send logs to a Kinesis Data Streams stream. To
specify a different stream name, change the driver
option values.

- **Export logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service**
– Configure the task to send container logs
to an OpenSearch Service domain. The log driver options must be
provided.

- **Export logs to Amazon S3** –
Configure the task to send container logs to an Amazon S3
bucket. The default log driver options are provided,
but you must specify a valid Amazon S3 bucket
name.

    10. (Optional) Configure additional container
         parameters.

        To configure this optionDo this

        **Restart policy**

        These options define a restart policy to
        restart a container when it exits.

        Expand **Restart**
        **policy**, and then configure the
        following items:

- To enable a restart policy for the
container, turn on **Enable Restart**
**policy**.

- For **Ignored exit codes**,
specify a comma-separated list of integer
container exit codes. If the container exits with
any of the specified exit codes, Amazon ECS will not try to
restart the container. If nothing is specified,
Amazon ECS will not ignore any exit codes.

- For **Attempt reset period**, specify an integer period of time,
in seconds, that the container must run for before a restart can be attempted in the event of an exit. Amazon ECS can attempt to restart a
container only once every **Attempt reset**
**period** seconds. If nothing is specified, the container must run for
300 seconds before a restart can be attempted.

**HealthCheck**

These are the commands that determine if a
container is healthy. For more information, see
[Determine Amazon ECS task health using container health checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/healthcheck.html).

Expand **HealthCheck**,
and then configure the following items:

- For **Command**, enter a
comma-separated list of commands. You can start
the commands with `CMD` to run the
command arguments directly, or
`CMD-SHELL` to run the command with the
container's default shell. If neither is
specified, `CMD` is used.

- For **Interval**, enter the
number of seconds between each health check. The
valid values are between 5 and 30.

- For **Timeout**, enter the
period of time (in seconds) to wait for a health
check to succeed before it's considered a failure.
The valid values are between 2 and 60.

- For **Start period**, enter
the period of time (in seconds) to wait for a
container to bootstrap before the health check
commands run. The valid values are between 0 and
300.

- For **Retries**, enter the
number of times to retry the health check commands
when there is a failure. The valid values are
between 1 and 10.

**Startup dependency**
**ordering**

This option defines dependencies for
container startup and shutdown. A container can

number of seconds.

- To configure the time to wait before the
container is stopped if it doesn't exit normally
on its own, for **Stop timeout**,
enter the number of seconds.

**Container network**
**settings**

These options determine
whether to use networking within a
container.

Expand **Container network**
**settings**, and then configure the
following:

- To disable container networking, select
**Turn off networking**.

- To configure DNS server IP addresses that
are presented to the container, in **DNS**
**servers**, enter the IP address of each
server on a separate line.

- To configure DNS domains to search
non-fully-qualified host names that are presented
to the container, in **DNS search**
**domains**, enter each domain on a
separate line.

The pattern is
`^[a-zA-Z0-9-.]{0,253}[a-zA-Z0-9]$`.

- To configure the container host name, in
**Host name**, enter the
container goat name.

- To add hostnames and IP address mappings
that are appended to the `/etc/hosts`
file on the container, choose **Add extra**
**host**, and then for
**Hostname** and **IP**
**address**, enter the host name and IP
address.

     OpenTelemetry integration, expand
     **Monitoring**, and then select **Use**
    **metric collection** to collect and send metrics for
     your tasks to either Amazon CloudWatch or Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. When this option is
     selected, Amazon ECS creates an AWS Distro for
     OpenTelemetry container sidecar that is preconfigured to
     send the application metrics. For more information, see [Correlate Amazon ECS application performance using application metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/metrics-data.html).
    1. When **Amazon CloudWatch** is selected, your
        custom application metrics are routed to CloudWatch as custom
        metrics. For more information, see [Exporting application metrics to Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/application-metrics-cloudwatch.html).

       ###### Important

       When exporting application metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, your
       task definition requires a task IAM role with the
       required permissions. For more information, see [Required IAM permissions for AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry integration with Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/application-metrics-cloudwatch.html#application-metrics-cloudwatch-iam).

    2. When you select **Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (Prometheus libraries**
       **instrumentation)**, your task-level CPU,
        memory, network, and storage metrics and your custom
        application metrics are routed to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. For
        **Workspace remote write endpoint**,
        enter the remote write endpoint URL for your
        Prometheus workspace. For
        **Scraping target**, enter the host and
        port the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry
        collector can use to scrape for metrics data. For more
        information, see [Exporting application metrics to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/application-metrics-prometheus.html).
