# Bind mount examples for Amazon ECS

The following examples cover the common use cases for using a bind mount for
your containers.

###### To allocate an increased amount of ephemeral storage space for a Fargate task

For Amazon ECS tasks that are hosted on Fargate using platform version
`1.4.0` or later (Linux) or `1.0.0` (Windows), you can
allocate more than the default amount of ephemeral storage for the containers in
your task to use. This example can be incorporated into the other examples to
allocate more ephemeral storage for your Fargate tasks.

- In the task definition, define an `ephemeralStorage` object.
The `sizeInGiB` must be an integer between the values of
`21` and `200` and is expressed in GiB.

```JSON

"ephemeralStorage": {
      "sizeInGiB": integer
}
```

###### To provide an empty data volume for one or more containers

In some cases, you want to provide the containers in a task some scratch
space. For example, you might have two database containers that need to access
the same scratch file storage location during a task. This can be achieved using
a bind mount.

1. In the task definition `volumes` section, define a bind mount
    with the name `database_scratch`.

```JSON

     "volumes": [
       {
         "name": "database_scratch"
       }
     ]
```

2. In the `containerDefinitions` section, create the database
    container definitions. This is so that they mount the volume.

```JSON

"containerDefinitions": [
       {
         "name": "database1",
         "image": "my-repo/database",
         "cpu": 100,
         "memory": 100,
         "essential": true,
         "mountPoints": [
           {
             "sourceVolume": "database_scratch",
             "containerPath": "/var/scratch"
           }
         ]
       },
       {
         "name": "database2",
         "image": "my-repo/database",
         "cpu": 100,
         "memory": 100,
         "essential": true,
         "mountPoints": [
           {
             "sourceVolume": "database_scratch",
             "containerPath": "/var/scratch"
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
```

###### To expose a path and its contents in a Dockerfile to a container

In this example, you have a Dockerfile that writes data that you want to mount
inside a container. This example works for tasks that are
hosted on Fargate or Amazon EC2 instances.

1. Create a Dockerfile. The following example uses the public Amazon Linux 2 container
    image and creates a file that's named `examplefile` in the
    `/var/log/exported` directory that we want to mount inside
    the container. The `VOLUME` directive should specify an absolute
    path.

```nohighlight

FROM public.ecr.aws/amazonlinux/amazonlinux:latest
RUN mkdir -p /var/log/exported
RUN touch /var/log/exported/examplefile
VOLUME ["/var/log/exported"]
```

By default, the volume permissions are set to `0755` and the
    owner as `root`. These permissions can be changed in the
    Dockerfile. In the following example, the owner of the
    `/var/log/exported` directory is set to
    `node`.

```nohighlight

FROM public.ecr.aws/amazonlinux/amazonlinux:latest
RUN yum install -y shadow-utils && yum clean all
RUN useradd node
RUN mkdir -p /var/log/exported && chown node:node /var/log/exported
USER node
RUN touch /var/log/exported/examplefile
VOLUME ["/var/log/exported"]
```

2. In the task definition `volumes` section, define a volume with
    the name `application_logs`.

```JSON

     "volumes": [
       {
         "name": "application_logs"
       }
     ]
```

3. In the `containerDefinitions` section, create the application
    container definitions. This is so they mount the storage. The
    `containerPath` value must match the absolute path that's
    specified in the `VOLUME` directive from the Dockerfile.

```JSON

     "containerDefinitions": [
       {
         "name": "application1",
         "image": "my-repo/application",
         "cpu": 100,
         "memory": 100,
         "essential": true,
         "mountPoints": [
           {
             "sourceVolume": "application_logs",
             "containerPath": "/var/log/exported"
           }
         ]
       },
       {
         "name": "application2",
         "image": "my-repo/application",
         "cpu": 100,
         "memory": 100,
         "essential": true,
         "mountPoints": [
           {
             "sourceVolume": "application_logs",
             "containerPath": "/var/log/exported"
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
```

###### To provide an empty data volume for a container that's tied to the lifecycle of the host Amazon EC2 instance

For tasks that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, you can use bind mounts and have
the data tied to the lifecycle of the host Amazon EC2 instance. You can do this by
using the `host` parameter and specifying a `sourcePath`
value. Any files that exist at the `sourcePath` are presented to the
containers at the `containerPath` value. Any files that are written
to the `containerPath` value are written to the
`sourcePath` value on the host Amazon EC2 instance.

###### Important

Amazon ECS doesn't sync your storage across Amazon EC2 instances. Tasks that use
persistent storage can be placed on any Amazon EC2 instance in your cluster that
has available capacity. If your tasks require persistent storage after
stopping and restarting, always specify the same Amazon EC2 instance at task
launch time with the AWS CLI [start-task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/start-task.html) command. You can also use Amazon EFS volumes for
persistent storage. For more information, see [Use Amazon EFS volumes with Amazon ECS](efs-volumes.md).

1. In the task definition `volumes` section, define a bind mount
    with `name` and `sourcePath` values. In the following
    example, the host Amazon EC2 instance contains data at `/ecs/webdata`
    that you want to mount inside the container.

```JSON

     "volumes": [
       {
         "name": "webdata",
         "host": {
           "sourcePath": "/ecs/webdata"
         }
       }
     ]
```

2. In the `containerDefinitions` section, define a container with
    a `mountPoints` value that references the name of the bind mount
    and the `containerPath` value to mount the bind mount at on the
    container.

```JSON

     "containerDefinitions": [
       {
         "name": "web",
         "image": "public.ecr.aws/docker/library/nginx:latest",
         "cpu": 99,
         "memory": 100,
         "portMappings": [
           {
             "containerPort": 80,
             "hostPort": 80
           }
         ],
         "essential": true,
         "mountPoints": [
           {
             "sourceVolume": "webdata",
             "containerPath": "/usr/share/nginx/html"
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
```

###### To mount a defined volume on multiple containers at different locations

You can define a data volume in a task definition and mount that volume at
different locations on different containers. For example, your host container
has a website data folder at `/data/webroot`. You might want
to mount that data volume as read-only on two different web servers that have
different document roots.

1. In the task definition `volumes` section, define a data volume
    with the name `webroot` and the source path
    `/data/webroot`.

```JSON

     "volumes": [
       {
         "name": "webroot",
         "host": {
           "sourcePath": "/data/webroot"
         }
       }
     ]
```

2. In the `containerDefinitions` section, define a container for
    each web server with `mountPoints` values that associate the
    `webroot` volume with the `containerPath` value
    pointing to the document root for that container.

```JSON

     "containerDefinitions": [
       {
         "name": "web-server-1",
         "image": "my-repo/ubuntu-apache",
         "cpu": 100,
         "memory": 100,
         "portMappings": [
           {
             "containerPort": 80,
             "hostPort": 80
           }
         ],
         "essential": true,
         "mountPoints": [
           {
             "sourceVolume": "webroot",
             "containerPath": "/var/www/html",
             "readOnly": true
           }
         ]
       },
       {
         "name": "web-server-2",
         "image": "my-repo/sles11-apache",
         "cpu": 100,
         "memory": 100,
         "portMappings": [
           {
             "containerPort": 8080,
             "hostPort": 8080
           }
         ],
         "essential": true,
         "mountPoints": [
           {
             "sourceVolume": "webroot",
             "containerPath": "/srv/www/htdocs",
             "readOnly": true
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
```

###### To mount volumes from another container using `volumesFrom`

For tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, you can define one or more volumes on a
container, and then use the `volumesFrom` parameter in a different
container definition within the same task to mount all of the volumes from the
`sourceContainer` at their originally defined mount points. The
`volumesFrom` parameter applies to volumes defined in the task
definition, and those that are built into the image with a Dockerfile.

1. (Optional) To share a volume that is built into an image, use the
    `VOLUME` instruction in the Dockerfile. The following example
    Dockerfile uses an `httpd` image, and then adds a volume and
    mounts it at `dockerfile_volume` in the Apache document root. It
    is the folder used by the `httpd` web server.

```

FROM httpd
VOLUME ["/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/dockerfile_volume"]
```

You can build an image with this Dockerfile and push it to a repository,
    such as Docker Hub, and use it in your task definition. The example
    `my-repo/httpd_dockerfile_volume` image that's used in the
    following steps was built with the preceding Dockerfile.

2. Create a task definition that defines your other volumes and mount points
    for the containers. In this example `volumes` section, you create
    an empty volume called `empty`, which the Docker daemon manages.
    There's also a host volume defined that's called `host_etc`. It
    exports the `/etc` folder on the host container instance.

```JSON

{
     "family": "test-volumes-from",
     "volumes": [
       {
         "name": "empty",
         "host": {}
       },
       {
         "name": "host_etc",
         "host": {
           "sourcePath": "/etc"
         }
       }
     ],
```

In the container definitions section, create a container that mounts the
    volumes defined earlier. In this example, the `web` container
    mounts the `empty` and `host_etc` volumes. This is the
    container that uses the image built with a volume in the Dockerfile.

```JSON

"containerDefinitions": [
       {
         "name": "web",
         "image": "my-repo/httpd_dockerfile_volume",
         "cpu": 100,
         "memory": 500,
         "portMappings": [
           {
             "containerPort": 80,
             "hostPort": 80
           }
         ],
         "mountPoints": [
           {
             "sourceVolume": "empty",
             "containerPath": "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/empty_volume"
           },
           {
             "sourceVolume": "host_etc",
             "containerPath": "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/host_etc"
           }
         ],
         "essential": true
       },
```

Create another container that uses `volumesFrom` to mount all
    of the volumes that are associated with the `web` container. All
    of the volumes on the `web` container are likewise mounted on the
    `busybox` container. This includes the volume that's
    specified in the Dockerfile that was used to build the
    `my-repo/httpd_dockerfile_volume` image.

```

       {
         "name": "busybox",
         "image": "busybox",
         "volumesFrom": [
           {
             "sourceContainer": "web"
           }
         ],
         "cpu": 100,
         "memory": 500,
         "entryPoint": [
           "sh",
           "-c"
         ],
         "command": [
           "echo $(date) > /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/empty_volume/date && echo $(date) > /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/host_etc/date && echo $(date) > /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/dockerfile_volume/date"
         ],
         "essential": false
       }
     ]
}
```

When this task is run, the two containers mount the volumes, and the
    `command` in the `busybox` container writes the
    date and time to a file. This file is called `date` in each of
    the volume folders. The folders are then visible at the website displayed by
    the `web` container.

###### Note

Because the `busybox` container runs a quick command and
then exits, it must be set as `"essential": false` in the
container definition. Otherwise, it stops the entire task when it
exits.
