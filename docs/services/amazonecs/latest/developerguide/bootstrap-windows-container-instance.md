# Bootstrapping Amazon ECS Windows container instances to pass data

When you launch an Amazon EC2 instance, you can pass user data to the EC2 instance. The data
can be used to perform common automated configuration tasks and even run scripts when the
instance boots. For Amazon ECS, the most common use cases for user data are to pass configuration
information to the Docker daemon and the Amazon ECS container agent.

You can pass multiple types of user data to Amazon EC2, including cloud boothooks, shell
scripts, and `cloud-init` directives. For more information about these and other
format types, see the [Cloud-Init\
documentation](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanation/format.html).

You can pass this user data when using the Amazon EC2 launch wizard. For more information, see
[Launching an Amazon ECS Linux container instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html).

## Default Windows user data

This example user data script shows the default user data that your Windows container
instances receive if you use the console. The script below does the following:

- Sets the cluster name to the name you entered.

- Sets the IAM roles for tasks.

- Sets `json-file` and `awslogs` as the available logging
drivers.

In addition, the following options are available when you use the `awsvpc`
network mode.

- `EnableTaskENI`: This flag turns on task networking and is required
when you use the `awsvpc` network mode.

- `AwsvpcBlockIMDS`: This optional flag blocks IMDS access for the
task containers running in `awsvpc` network mode.

- `AwsvpcAdditionalLocalRoutes`: This optional flag allows you to
have additional routes.

Replace `ip-address` with the IP Address for the additional routes,
for example 172.31.42.23/32.

You can use this script for your own container instances (provided that they are
launched from the Amazon ECS-optimized Windows Server AMI).

Replace the `-Cluster cluster-name` line to
specify your own cluster name.

```nohighlight

<powershell>
Initialize-ECSAgent -Cluster cluster-name -EnableTaskIAMRole -LoggingDrivers '["json-file","awslogs"]' -EnableTaskENI -AwsvpcBlockIMDS -AwsvpcAdditionalLocalRoutes
'["ip-address"]'
</powershell>
```

For Windows tasks that are configured to use the `awslogs` logging driver,
you must also set the `ECS_ENABLE_AWSLOGS_EXECUTIONROLE_OVERRIDE` environment
variable on your container instance. Use the following syntax.

Replace the `-Cluster cluster-name` line to
specify your own cluster name.

```nohighlight

<powershell>
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ECS_ENABLE_AWSLOGS_EXECUTIONROLE_OVERRIDE", $TRUE, "Machine")
Initialize-ECSAgent -Cluster cluster-name -EnableTaskIAMRole -LoggingDrivers '["json-file","awslogs"]'
</powershell>
```

## Windows agent installation user data

This example user data script installs the Amazon ECS container agent on an instance
launched with a **Windows\_Server-2016-English-Full-Containers** AMI. It
has been adapted from the agent installation instructions on the [Amazon ECS Container Agent GitHub\
repository](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent) README page.

###### Note

This script is shared for example purposes. It is much easier to get started with
Windows containers by using the Amazon ECS-optimized Windows Server AMI. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon ECS cluster for Fargate workloads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-cluster-console-v2.html).

For information about how to install the Amazon ECS agent on Windows Server 2022 Full,
see [Issue\
3753](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/issues/3753) on GitHub.

You can use this script for your own container instances (provided that they are
launched with a version of the
**Windows\_Server-2016-English-Full-Containers** AMI). Be sure to
replace the `windows` line to specify your own
cluster name (if you are not using a cluster called `windows`).
