# Amazon ECS EventBridge IAM Role

Before you can use Amazon ECS scheduled tasks with EventBridge rules and targets, the EventBridge service
needs permissions to run Amazon ECS tasks on your behalf. These permissions are provided by the
EventBridge IAM role ( `ecsEventsRole`).

The `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceEventsRole` policy is shown below.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["ecs:RunTask"],
            "Resource": ["*"]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:PassRole",
            "Resource": ["*"],
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {"iam:PassedToService": "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"}
            }
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ecs:TagResource",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "ecs:CreateAction": ["RunTask"]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

If your scheduled tasks require the use of the task execution role, a task role, or a task
role override, then you must add `iam:PassRole` permissions for each task
execution role, task role, or task role override to the EventBridge IAM role. For more
information about the task execution role, see [Amazon ECS task execution IAM role](task-execution-iam-role.md).

###### Note

Specify the full ARN of your task execution role or task role override.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:PassRole",
            "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole_or_TaskRole_name"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

You can choose to let the AWS Management Console create the EventBridge role for you when you configure a
scheduled task. For more information, see [Using Amazon EventBridge Scheduler to schedule Amazon ECS tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/tasks-scheduled-eventbridge-scheduler.html).

## Creating the EventBridge role

Replace all `user input` with your own information.

1. Create a file named `eventbridge-trust-policy.json` that
    contains the trust policy to use for the IAM role. The file should contain the
    following:
JSON

```json

{
     "Version":"2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "Service": "events.amazonaws.com"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
       }
     ]
}

```

2. Use the following command to create an IAM role named
    `ecsEventsRole` by using the trust policy that you
    created in the previous step.

```nohighlight

aws iam create-role \
         --role-name ecsEventsRole \
         --assume-role-policy-document file://eventbridge-trust-policy.json
```

3. Attach the AWS managed
    `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceEventsRole` to the `ecsEventsRole` role using the following command.

```nohighlight

aws iam attach-role-policy \
         --role-name ecsEventsRole \
         --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEC2ContainerServiceEventsRole
```

You can also use the IAM console's **Custom trust policy** workflow
( [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam)) to create the role. For more information, see [Creating a role using\
custom trust policies (console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-custom.html) in the _IAM User_
_Guide_.

## Attaching a policy to the `ecsEventsRole` role

You can use the following procedures to add permissions for the task execution role to the EventBridge IAM role.

AWS Management Console

###### To use the JSON policy editor to create a policy

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Policies**.

If this is your first time choosing **Policies**, the
    **Welcome to Managed Policies** page appears. Choose **Get**
**Started**.

3. At the top of the page, choose **Create policy**.

4. In the **Policy editor** section, choose the
    **JSON** option.

5. Enter the following JSON policy document:

```

{
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "iam:PassRole",
               "Resource": ["arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/<ecsTaskExecutionRole_or_TaskRole_name>"]
           }
       ]
}
```

6. Choose **Next**.

###### Note

You can switch between the **Visual** and **JSON**
editor options anytime. However, if you make changes or choose **Next**
in the **Visual** editor, IAM might restructure your policy to
optimize it for the visual editor. For more information, see [Policy restructuring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_policies.html#troubleshoot_viseditor-restructure)
in the _IAM User Guide_.

7. On the **Review and create** page, enter a **Policy**
**name** and a **Description** (optional) for the policy that
    you are creating. Review **Permissions defined in this policy** to see
    the permissions that are granted by your policy.

8. Choose **Create policy** to save your new policy.

After you create the policy, attach the policy to the EventBridge role. For information about
how to attach the policy to the role, see [Update permissions for a role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_update-role-permissions.html) in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide_.

AWS CLI

Replace all `user input` with your own information.

1. Create a file called `ev-iam-passrole.json` with the
    following content.

JSON

JSON

```json

{
       "Version":"2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "iam:PassRole",
               "Resource": [
               "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole_or_TaskRole_name"
               ]
           }
       ]
}

```

2. Use the following AWS CLI command to create the IAM policy using the
    JSON policy document file.

```nohighlight

aws iam create-policy \
         --policy-name eventsTaskExecutionPolicy \
         --policy-document file://ev-iam-passrole.json
```

3. Retrieve the ARN of the IAM policy you created using the
    following command.

```nohighlight

aws iam list-policies --scope Local --query 'Policies[?PolicyName==`eventsTaskExecutionPolicy`].Arn'
```

4. Use the following command to attach the policy to the EventBridge IAM role by using the policy ARN.

```nohighlight

aws iam attach-role-policy \
         --role-name ecsEventsRole \
         --policy-arn arn:aws:iam:111122223333:aws:policy/eventsTaskExecutionPolicy
```
