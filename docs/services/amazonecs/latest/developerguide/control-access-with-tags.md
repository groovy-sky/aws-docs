# Control access to Amazon ECS resources using resource tags

When you create an IAM policy that grants users permission to use Amazon ECS resources, you
can include tag information in the `Condition` element of the policy to
control access based on tags. This is known as attribute-based access control (ABAC).
ABAC provides better control over which resources a user can modify, use, or delete. For
more information, see [What is ABAC\
for AWS?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html)

For example, you can create a policy that allows users to delete a cluster, but denies
the action if the cluster has the tag `environment=production`. To do this,
you use the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key to allow or deny access to the
resource based on the tags that are attached to the resource.

```json

"StringEquals": { "aws:ResourceTag/environment": "production" }
```

To learn whether an Amazon ECS API action supports controlling access using the
`aws:ResourceTag` condition key, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonelasticcontainerservice.html). Note that the
`Describe` actions do not support resource-level permissions, so you must
specify them in a separate statement without conditions.

For example IAM policies, see [Amazon ECS Example policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/iam-policies-ecs-console.html).

If you allow or deny users access to resources based on tags, you must consider
explicitly denying users the ability to add those tags to or remove them from the same
resources. Otherwise, it's possible for a user to circumvent your restrictions and gain
access to a resource by modifying its tags.
