# Amazon ECS service utilization metrics use cases

The following list provides information about when to use the Amazon ECS metrics.

- **Resource utilization monitoring**: Use average statistics to monitor CPU and memory consumption patterns, establish performance baselines, and detect gradual performance degradation trends.

- **Cost optimization**: Use average statistics to monitor resource usage, right-size containers, adjust reservations based on usage patterns, and implement scheduled scaling.

- **Performance benchmarking**: Use average statistics to compare metrics between service revisions, establish performance KPIs, and validate optimization improvements.

- **Resource floor detection**: Use average statistics to identify minimum resource needs during idle periods, set appropriate reservations, and detect abnormal drops.

- **Anomaly detection**: Use minimum statistics to spot unusual resource utilization drops that indicate potential problems, such as initialization failures or unexpected idle periods.

- **Scaling policy refinement**: Use minimum statistics to establish optimal scale-in thresholds based on minimum viable utilization to prevent aggressive scaling.

- **Capacity planning**: Use maximum statistics to set appropriate task sizes and plan infrastructure with sufficient headroom for traffic spikes.

- **Performance bottleneck identification**: Use maximum statistics to detect resource saturation points, identify bottlenecks, and determine when to increase task size.

- **Scaling policy configuration**: Use maximum statistics to set optimal scale-out thresholds based on peak patterns and configure burst capacity.

- **SLA compliance monitoring**: Use maximum statistics to track peak response times and error rates to ensure service performance meets defined SLAs.
