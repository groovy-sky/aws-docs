# Use service discovery to connect Amazon ECS services with DNS names

Your Amazon ECS service can optionally be configured to use Amazon ECS service discovery.
Service discovery uses AWS Cloud Map API actions to manage HTTP and DNS namespaces for
your Amazon ECS services. For more information, see [What\
Is AWS Cloud Map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/Welcome.html) in the _AWS Cloud Map Developer Guide_.

## Service Discovery concepts

Service discovery consists of the following components:

- **Service discovery namespace**: A
logical group of service discovery services that share the same domain name,
such as `example.com`, which is where you want to route traffic. You
can create a namespace with a call to the `aws servicediscovery
                          create-private-dns-namespace` command or in the Amazon ECS console. You can
use the `aws servicediscovery list-namespaces` command to view the
summary information about the namespaces that were created by the current
account. For more information about the service discovery commands, see
`create-private-dns-namespace` and `list-namespaces` in the _AWS Cloud Map (service discovery) AWS CLI Reference Guide_.

- **Service discovery service**: Exists
within the service discovery namespace and consists of the service name and
DNS configuration for the namespace. It provides the following core
component:

- **Service registry**: Allows you to look
up a service via DNS or AWS Cloud Map API actions and get back one or more
available endpoints that can be used to connect to the service.

- **Service discovery instance**: Exists
within the service discovery service and consists of the attributes associated
with each Amazon ECS service in the service directory.

- **Instance attributes**: The following
metadata is added as custom attributes for each Amazon ECS service that is
configured to use service discovery:

- **`AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`** – For an
`A` record, the IPv4 address that Route 53 returns
in response to DNS queries and AWS Cloud Map returns when discovering
instance details, for example, `192.0.2.44`.

- **`AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`**–
For an `AAAA` record, the IPv6 address that Route 53
returns in response to DNS queries and AWS Cloud Map returns when
discovering instance details, for example, `
                                              2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`. Both
`AWS_INSTANCE_IPv4` and
`AWS_INSTANCE_IPv6` are added for Amazon ECS
dualstack services. Only `AWS_INSTANCE_IPv6` is
added for Amazon ECS IPv6-only services.

- **`AWS_INSTANCE_PORT`** – The port
value associated with the service discovery service.

- **`AVAILABILITY_ZONE`** – The
Availability Zone into which the task was launched. For tasks
using EC2, this is the
Availability Zone in which the container instance exists. For
tasks using Fargate, this is the
Availability Zone in which the elastic network interface
exists.

- **`REGION`** –
The Region in which the task exists.

- **`ECS_SERVICE_NAME`**
– The name of the Amazon ECS service to which the task
belongs.

- **`ECS_CLUSTER_NAME`**
– The name of the Amazon ECS cluster to which the task
belongs.

- **`EC2_INSTANCE_ID`**
– The ID of the container instance the task was placed on.
This custom attribute is not added if the task is using
Fargate.

- **`ECS_TASK_DEFINITION_FAMILY`** –
The task definition family that the task is using.

- **`ECS_TASK_SET_EXTERNAL_ID`** – If
a task set is created for an external deployment and is
associated with a service discovery registry, then the
`ECS_TASK_SET_EXTERNAL_ID` attribute will contain
the external ID of the task set.

- **Amazon ECS health checks**: Amazon ECS performs periodic
container-level health checks. If an endpoint does not pass the health check, it
is removed from DNS routing and marked as unhealthy.

## Service discovery considerations

The following should be considered when using service discovery:

- Service discovery is supported for tasks on Fargate that
use platform version 1.1.0 or later. For more information, see [Fargate platform versions for Amazon ECS](platform-fargate.md).

- Services configured to use service discovery have a limit of 1,000 tasks per
service. This is due to a Route 53 service quota.

- The Create Service workflow in the Amazon ECS console only supports registering
services into private DNS namespaces. When an AWS Cloud Map private DNS namespace is
created, a Route 53 private hosted zone will be created automatically.

- The VPC DNS attributes must be configured for successful DNS resolution. For
information about how to configure the attributes, see [DNS support in your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-support) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- Amazon ECS does not support registering services into shared AWS Cloud Map namespaces.

- The DNS records created for a service discovery service always register with
the private IP address for the task, rather than the public IP address, even
when public namespaces are used.

- Service discovery requires that tasks specify either the
`awsvpc`, `bridge`, or `host` network mode
( `none` is not supported).

- If the service task definition uses the `awsvpc` network mode, you
can create any combination of `A` or `SRV` records for
each service task. If you use `SRV` records, a port is required. You
can additionally create `AAAA` records if the service uses dualstack
subnets. If the service uses IPv6-only subnets, you can't create `A` records.

- If the service task definition uses the `bridge` or
`host` network mode, the SRV record is the only supported DNS
record type. Create a SRV record for each service task. The SRV record must
specify a container name and container port combination from the task
definition.

- DNS records for a service discovery service can be queried within your VPC.
They use the following format:
`<service-discovery-service-name>.<service-discovery-namespace>`.

- When doing a DNS query on the service name, `A` and `AAAA` records return a
set of IP addresses that correspond to your tasks. `SRV` records return a set of
IP addresses and ports for each task.

- If you have eight or fewer healthy records, Route 53 responds to all DNS queries
with all of the healthy records.

- When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight
unhealthy records.

- You can configure service discovery for a service that's behind a load
balancer, but service discovery traffic is always routed to the task and not
the load balancer.

- Service discovery doesn't support the use of Classic Load Balancers.

- We recommend you use container-level health checks managed by Amazon ECS for your
service discovery service.

- **HealthCheckCustomConfig**—Amazon ECS
manages health checks on your behalf. Amazon ECS uses information from
container and health checks, and your task state, to update the health
with AWS Cloud Map. This is specified using the
`--health-check-custom-config` parameter when creating
your service discovery service. For more information, see [HealthCheckCustomConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_HealthCheckCustomConfig.html) in the
_AWS Cloud Map API Reference_.

- The AWS Cloud Map resources created when service discovery is used must be cleaned
up manually.

- Tasks and instances are registered as `UNHEALTHY` until the
container health checks return a value. If the health checks pass, the status is
updated to `HEALTHY`. If the container health checks fail, the
service discovery instance is deregistered.

## Service discovery pricing

Customers using Amazon ECS service discovery are charged for Route 53 resources and AWS Cloud Map
discovery API operations. This involves costs for creating the Route 53 hosted zones and
queries to the service registry. For more information, see [AWS Cloud Map Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/cloud-map-pricing.html) in the
_AWS Cloud Map Developer Guide_.

Amazon ECS performs container level health checks and exposes them to AWS Cloud Map custom health
check API operations. This is currently made available to customers at no extra cost. If
you configure additional network health checks for publicly exposed tasks, you're
charged for those health checks.
