# Example Amazon ECS task definition: Route logs to CloudWatch

Before your containers can send logs to CloudWatch, you must specify the `awslogs` log
driver for containers in your task definition. For more information about the log parameters, see [Storage and logging](task-definition-parameters.md#container_definition_storage)

The task definition JSON that follows has a `logConfiguration` object
specified for each container. One is for the WordPress container that sends logs to a
log group called `awslogs-wordpress`. The other is for a MySQL container that
sends logs to a log group that's called `awslogs-mysql`. Both containers use
the `awslogs-example` log stream prefix.

## Next steps

- You can optionally set a retention policy for the log group by using the CloudWatch AWS CLI or API.
For more information, see [put-retention-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/logs/put-retention-policy.html) in the _AWS Command Line Interface_
_Reference_.

- After you have registered a task definition with the `awslogs` log driver
in a container definition log configuration, you can run a task or create a service with
that task definition to start sending logs to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see [Running an application as an Amazon ECS task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/standalone-task-create.html) and [Creating an Amazon ECS rolling update deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-service-console-v2.html).
