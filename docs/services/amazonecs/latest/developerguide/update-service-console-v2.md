# Updating an Amazon ECS service

After you create a service, there are times when you might need to update the service
parameters, for example the number of tasks.

When you update a service that uses Amazon ECS circuit breaker, Amazon ECS creates a service
deployment and a service revision. These resources allow you to view detailed information
about the service history. For more information, see [View service history using Amazon ECS service deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-deployment.html).

## Prerequisites

Before updating a service, verify which service parameters can be changed for your
deployment type. For a complete list of changeable parameters, see [Update Amazon ECS service parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/update-service-parameters.html).

## Procedure

Console

01. Open the console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2).

02. On the **Clusters** page, choose the
     cluster.

03. On the cluster details page, in the **Services**
     section, select the check box next to the service, and then choose
     **Update**.

04. To have your service start a new deployment, select
     **Force new deployment**.

05. For **Task definition**, choose the task
     definition family and revision.

    ###### Important

    The console validates that the selected task definition family
    and revision are compatible with the defined compute
    configuration. If you receive a warning, verify both your task
    definition compatibility and the compute configuration that you
    selected.

06. If you chose **Replica**, for **Desired**
    **tasks**, enter the number of tasks to launch and
     maintain in the service.

07. If you chose **Replica**, to have Amazon ECS monitor
     the distribution of tasks across Availability Zones, and
     redistribute them when there is an imbalance, under
     **Availability Zone service rebalancing**,
     select **Availability Zone service**
    **rebalancing**.

08. For **Min running tasks**, enter the lower limit
     on the number of tasks in the service that must remain in the
     `RUNNING` state during a deployment, as a percentage
     of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer).
     For more information, see [Deployment configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service_definition_parameters.html#sd-deploymentconfiguration).

09. For **Max running tasks**, enter the upper limit
     on the number of tasks in the service that are allowed in the
     `RUNNING` or `PENDING` state during a
     deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded
     down to the nearest integer).

10. To configure how tasks are deployed for your service, expand
     **Deployment options** and then configure your
     options.
    1. For **Deployment controller type**,
        specify the service deployment controller. The Amazon ECS console
        supports the following controller types:
        `ECS`.

    2. For **Deployment strategy**, choose the
        strategy used by Amazon ECS to deploy new versions of the
        service.

    3. Depending on the choice of **Deployment**
       **strategy**, do the following:

       Deployment strategySteps

       **Rolling update**

1. For **Min running tasks**
**%**, specify a minimum percentage value
    of tasks that must run during a service
    deployment. For more information, see [Deploy Amazon ECS services by replacing tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-ecs.html).

2. For **Max running tasks**
**%**, specify a maximum percentage value
    of tasks that can run during a service deployment.
    For more information, see [Deploy Amazon ECS services by replacing tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-ecs.html).

**Blue/green**

For **Bake time**, specify
a time duration, in minutes, that blue and green
service revisions should run simultaenously. For
more information, see [Amazon ECS blue/green deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-blue-green.html).

    4. To run Lambda functions for a lifecycle stage, under **Deployment lifecyce**
       **hooks** do the following for each unique Lambda function:

       1. Choose **Add**.

          Repeat for every unique function you want to run.

       2. For **Lambda function**, enter the function name.

       3. For **Role**, choose the role that you created in the prerequisites with the
           blue/green permissions.

          For more information, see [Permissions required for Lambda functions in Amazon ECS blue/green deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/blue-green-permissions.html).

       4. For **Lifecycle stages**, select the stages the Lambda function runs.

       5. (Optional) For **Hook details**, enter a key value pair that provides
           information about the hook.
11. To configure how Amazon ECS detects and handles deployment failures, expand
     **Deployment failure detection**, and then choose
     your options.
    1. To stop a deployment when the tasks cannot start, select **Use the Amazon ECS**
       **deployment circuit breaker**.

       To have the software automatically roll back the deployment to the last
        completed deployment state when the deployment circuit breaker sets the
        deployment to a failed state, select **Rollback on**
       **failures**.

    2. To stop a deployment based on application metrics, select **Use CloudWatch alarm(s)**.
        Then, from **CloudWatch alarm name**, choose the alarms. To create a new alarm,
        go to the CloudWatch console.

       To have the software automatically roll back the deployment to the last
        completed deployment state when a CloudWatch alarm sets the
        deployment to a failed state, select **Rollback on**
       **failures**.
12. To change the compute options, expand **Compute**
    **configuration**, and then do the following:
    1. For services on AWS Fargate, for **Platform**
       **version**, choose the new version.

    2. For services that use a capacity provider strategy, for
        **Capacity provider strategy**, do the
        following:

- To add an additional capacity provider, choose
**Add more**. Then, for
**Capacity provider**, choose the
capacity provider.

- To remove a capacity provider, to the right of the
capacity provider, choose
**Remove**.

A service that's using an Auto Scaling group capacity provider can't be
updated to use a Fargate capacity provider. A service
that's using a Fargate capacity provider can't be updated
to use an Auto Scaling group capacity provider.
13. (Optional) To configure service Auto Scaling, expand **Service auto**
    **scaling**, and then specify the following parameters.To use predicte auto scaling, which looks at past load data from traffic flows, configure it after you create the service. For more information, see [Use historical patterns to scale Amazon ECS services with predictive scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/predictive-auto-scaling.html).
    1. To use service auto scaling, select **Service auto**
       **scaling**.

    2. For **Minimum number of tasks**, enter the lower limit of
        the number of tasks for service auto scaling to use. The desired count will not go below this count.

    3. For **Maximum number of tasks**, enter the upper
        limit of the number of tasks for service auto scaling to use. The desired count will not go above this count.

    4. Choose the policy type. Under **Scaling policy type**, choose
        one of the following options.

       To use this policy typeDo this

       Target tracking

1. For **Scaling policy**
**type**, choose **Target**
**tracking**.

2. For **Policy name**, enter
    the name of the policy.

3. For **ECS service metric**,
    select one of the following metrics.

- **ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization** –
Average CPU utilization of the service.

- **ECSServiceAverageMemoryUtilization** –
Average memory utilization of the service.

- **ALBRequestCountPerTarget**
– Number of requests completed per target
in an Application Load Balancer target group.

4. For **Target value**, enter
    the value the service maintains for the selected
    metric.

5. For **Scale-out cooldown**
**period**, enter the amount of time, in seconds, after a scale-out activity (add tasks) that must pass before another scale-out activity can start.

6. For **Scale-in cooldown**
**period**, enter the amount of time, in seconds, after a scale-in activity (remove tasks) that must pass before another scale-in activity can start.

7. To prevent the policy from performing a
    scale-in activity, select **Turn off**
**scale-in**.

8. • (Optional) Select **Turn off scale-in** if you want your scaling policy to scale out for increased traffic but don’t need it to scale in when traffic decreases.

Step scaling

1. For **Scaling policy**
**type**, choose **Step**
**scaling**.

2. For **Policy name**, enter
    the policy name.

3. For **Alarm name**, enter a
    unique name for the alarm.

4. For **Amazon ECS service**
**metric**, choose the metric to use for
    the alarm.

5. For **Statistic**, choose
    the alarm statistic.

6. For **Period**, choose the
    period for the alarm.

7. For **Alarm condition**,
    choose how to compare the selected metric to the
    defined threshold.

8. For **Threshold to compare**
**metrics** and **Evaluation period**
**to initiate alarm**, enter the threshold
    used for the alarm and how long to evaluate the
    threshold.

9. Under **Scaling actions**, do
    the following:

- For **Action**,
select whether to add, remove, or set a
specific desired count for your service.

- If you chose to add or remove tasks,
for **Value**, enter the number
of tasks (or percent of existing tasks) to add or
remove when the scaling action is initiated. If
you chose to set the desired count, enter the
number of tasks. For **Type**,
select whether the **Value** is
an integer or a percent value of the existing
desired count.

- For **Lower bound** and
**Upper bound**, enter the lower
boundary and upper boundary of your step scaling
adjustment. By default, the lower bound for an add policy is the alarm threshold and the upper bound is positive (+) infinity. By default, the upper bound for a remove policy is the alarm threshold and the lower bound is negative (-) infinity.

- (Optional) Add additional scaling options.
Choose **Add new scaling**
**action**, and then repeat the
**Scaling actions** steps.

- For **Cooldown period**, enter the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a previous scaling activity to take effect. For an add policy, this is the time after a scale-out activity that the scaling policy blocks scale-in activities and limits how many tasks can be scale out at a time. For a remove policy, this is the time after a scale-in activity that must pass before another scale-in activity can start.
14. (Optional) To use Service Connect, select **Turn on**
    **Service Connect**, and then specify the
     following:
    1. Under **Service Connect configuration**,
        specify the client mode.

- If your service runs a network client application
that only needs to connect to other services in the
namespace, choose **Client side**
**only**.

- If your service runs a network or web service
application and needs to provide endpoints for this
service, and connects to other services in the
namespace, choose **Client and**
**server**.

    2. To use a namespace that is not the default cluster
        namespace, for **Namespace**, choose the
        service namespace. This can be a namespace created separately in the same AWS Region in your
        AWS account or a namespace in the same Region that is shared with your
        account using AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM). For more information about shared AWS Cloud Map namespaces, see [Cross-account AWS Cloud Map namespace\
        sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/sharing-namespaces.html) in the _AWS Cloud Map Developer Guide_

    3. (Optional) Specify a log configuration. Select **Use log**
       **collection**. The default option sends container logs to
        CloudWatch Logs. The other log driver options are configured using AWS FireLens.
        For more information, see [Send Amazon ECS logs to an AWS service or AWS Partner](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_firelens.html).

       The following describes each container log destination in more
        detail.

- **Amazon CloudWatch** – Configure the task to
send container logs to CloudWatch Logs. The default log driver options are
provided, which create a CloudWatch log group on your behalf. To
specify a different log group name, change the driver option
values.

- **Amazon Data Firehose** – Configure the task to
send container logs to Firehose. The default log driver options are
provided, which send logs to a Firehose delivery stream. To specify
a different delivery stream name, change the driver option
values.

- **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** – Configure the task to
send container logs to Kinesis Data Streams. The default log driver options are
provided, which send logs to an Kinesis Data Streams stream. To specify a
different stream name, change the driver option values.

- **Amazon OpenSearch Service** – Configure the task to
send container logs to an OpenSearch Service domain. The log driver options
must be provided.

- **Amazon S3** – Configure the task to send
container logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. The default log driver options
are provided, but you must specify a valid Amazon S3 bucket
name.

    4. To enable access logs, follow these steps:

       1. Expand **Access log configuration**. For **Format**, choose either **JSON** or `TEXT`.

       2. To include query parameters in access logs, select **Include query parameters**.

###### Note

To disable access logs, for **Format**, choose **None**.
15. If your task uses a data volume that's compatible with
     configuration at deployment, you can configure the volume by
     expanding **Volume**.

    The volume name and volume type are configured when you create a
     task definition revision and can't be changed when you update a
     service. To update the volume name and type, you must create a new
     task definition revision and update the service by using the new
     revision.

    To configure this volume typeDo this

    Amazon EBS

01. For **EBS volume type**, choose
     the type of EBS volume that you want
     to attach to your task.

02. For **Size (GiB)**, enter a valid
     value for the volume size in gibibytes (GiB). You
     can specify a minimum of 1 GiB and a maximum of
     16,384 GiB volume size. This value is required
     unless you provide a snapshot ID.

03. For **IOPS**, enter the maximum
     number of input/output operations (IOPS) that the
     volume should provide. This value is configurable
     only for `io1`, `io2`, and
     `gp3` volume types.

04. For **Throughput (MiB/s)**, enter
     the throughput that the volume should provide, in
     mebibytes per second (MiBps, or MiB/s). This value
     is configurable only for the `gp3` volume
     type.

05. For **Snapshot ID**, choose an
     existing Amazon EBS volume snapshot or enter the ARN of a
     snapshot if you want to create a volume from a
     snapshot. You can also create a new, empty volume by
     not choosing or entering a snapshot
     ID.

06. If you specify a **Snapshot ID**, you
     can specify a **Volume initialization rate**
    **(MiB/s)**. Enter a value between 100 and
     300, in MiB/s, that will determine how fast data is
     loaded from the snapshot specified using
     **Snapshot ID** for volume
     creation.

07. For **File system type**, choose
     the type of file system that will be used for data
     storage and retrieval on the volume. You can choose
     either the operating system default or a specific
     file system type. The default for Linux is
     `XFS`. For volumes created from a snapshot, you must specify the same filesystem type that the volume was using when the snapshot was created. If there is a filesystem type mismatch, the task will fail to start.

08. For **Infrastructure role**,
     choose an IAM role with the necessary permissions
     that allow Amazon ECS to manage Amazon EBS volumes for tasks.
     You can attach the
     `AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForVolumes`
     managed policy to the role, or you can use the
     policy as a guide to create and attach an your own
     policy with permissions that meet your specific
     needs. For more information about the necessary
     permissions,
     see
     [Amazon ECS infrastructure IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/infrastructure_IAM_role.html).

09. For **Encryption**, choose
     **Default** if you want to use
     the Amazon EBS encryption by default settings. If your
     account has [Encryption by default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/encryption-by-default.html) configured, the
     volume will be encrypted with the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
     key that's specified in the setting. If you choose
     **Default** and Amazon EBS default
     encryption isn't turned on, the volume will be
     unencrypted.

    If you choose **Custom**, you can
     specify an AWS KMS key of your choice for volume
     encryption.

    If you choose **None**, the
     volume will be unencrypted unless you have
     encryption by default configured,
     or
     if you create a volume from an encrypted
     snapshot.

10. If you've chosen **Custom** for
     **Encryption**, you must specify
     the AWS KMS key that you want to use. For
     **KMS key**, choose an
     AWS KMS key or enter a key ARN. If you choose to
     encrypt your volume by using a symmetric customer managed key,
     make sure that you have the right permissions
     defined in your AWS KMS key policy. For more
     information, see [Data encryption for Amazon EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ebs-volumes.html?icmpid=docs_ecs_hp-deploy#ebs-kms-encryption).

11. (Optional) Under **Tags**, you can
     add tags to your Amazon EBS volume by either propagating tags
     from the task definition or service, or by providing your own
     tags.

     If you want to propagate tags from the task
     definition, choose **Task definition**
     for **Propagate tags from**. If you want to propagate tags from the service, choose **Service**
     for **Propagate tags from**. If you
     choose **Do not propagate**, or if you
     don't choose a value, the tags aren't propagated.

    If you want to provide your own tags, choose
     **Add tag** and then provide the
     key and value for each tag you add.

    For more information about tagging Amazon EBS volumes, see
     [Tagging Amazon EBS volumes](specify-ebs-config.md#ebs-volume-tagging).

16. (Optional) To help identify your service, expand the
     **Tags** section, and then configure your
     tags.

- \[Add a tag\] Choose **Add tag**, and do
the following:

- For **Key**, enter the key
name.

- For **Value**, enter the key
value.

- \[Remove a tag\] Next to the tag, choose **Remove**
**tag**.

17. Choose **Update**.

AWS CLI

- Run `update-service`. For information about running the
command, see [update-service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/update-service.html) in the AWS Command Line Interface Reference.

The following `update-service` example updates the
desired task count of the service `my-http-service` to
2.

Replace the `user-input` with your
values.

```nohighlight

aws ecs update-service \
      --cluster MyCluster \
      --service my-http-service \
      --desired-count 2
```
