# Stopping an Amazon ECS task

If you no longer need to keep a standalone task running, you can stop the task. The
Amazon ECS console makes it easy to stop one or more tasks.

You can't restart a standalone stopped task.

If you want to stop a service, see [Deleting an Amazon ECS service using the console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/delete-service-v2.html).

###### To stop a standalone task (AWS Management Console)

1. Open the console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Clusters**.

3. On the **Clusters** page, choose the cluster to navigate to
    the cluster details page.

4. On the cluster detail page, choose the **Tasks** tab.

5. You can filter tasks by launch type using the **Filter launch**
**type** list.

###### Important

If you choose to stop all tasks using the console,
Amazon ECS stops all standalone tasks and tasks that are part
of a service. Therefore, we recommend caution when using
this option.

1. Choose **Stop**, **Stop**
**all**.

2. On the **Stop task confirmation**
**page**, enter **Stop all**
**tasks**, and then choose
    **Stop**.
