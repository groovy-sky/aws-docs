# Prepare for AWS Fargate task retirement on Amazon ECS

In order to prepare for task retirement, perform the following operations:

1. Set the task retirement wait period or use Amazon EC2 event windows.

2. Capture task retirement notifications to notify team members.

3. You can ensure all your services' tasks run on the latest platform revision
    by updating the service with the force-deployment option. This step is optional.

## Step 1: Set the task wait time or use Amazon EC2 event windows

You have two account settings options to configure the time that Fargate starts
task retirements: `fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod` and `fargateEventWindows`.

**Using fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod account setting**

You can configure the time that Fargate starts the task retirement.
The default wait period is 7 days. For workloads
that require immediate application of the updates, choose the immediate setting ( `0`). If you need more time,
configure the `7`, or `14` day option.

We recommend that you choose a shorter waiting period in order to pick up newer platform versions revisions sooner.

Configure the wait period by running
`put-account-setting-default` or `put-account-setting` as the root user or an administrative user. Use the
`fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod` option for the `name` and the `value` option set to one of the following values:

- `0` \- AWS sends the notification, and immediately starts to retire the affected tasks.

- `7` \- AWS sends the notification, and waits 7 calendar days before starting to retire the affected tasks. This is the default.

- `14` \- AWS sends the notification, and waits 14 calendar days before starting to retire the affected tasks.

For more information, see, [put-account-setting-default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/put-account-setting-default.html) and [put-account-setting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/put-account-setting.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference_.

**Using fargateEventWindows account setting**

As of 12/18/2025, Amazon ECS enables you to configure [Amazon EC2 event windows](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/event-windows.md) for your Fargate tasks. If
you need precise control over the exact timing of task retirements, for example, scheduling them over
weekends to avoid disruption during business hours, you can configure Amazon EC2 event windows for your tasks,
services, or clusters.

When you use event windows, Fargate ensures that your tasks run for at least 3 days before they are
retired within the next available window, unless stopped by user-initiated actions or critical health events such
as degradation of the underlying hardware.

Set the `fargateEventWindows` account setting to `enabled`. You can use one of the following APIs:
`put-account-setting-default` or `put-account-setting` as the root user or an administrative user.

Each Amazon EC2 event window must be open for at least 4 hours per week, and each time range must be at least 2 hours long.
For large clusters and services we recommend configuring event windows with either long durations (8 hours or more) or more frequent time
ranges that occur at least once every 3 days. You can further review considerations for Amazon EC2 event windows in the [user guide](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/event-windows.md#event-windows-considerations) AWS Fargate
ensures that your tasks run for at least 3 days before they are retired, unless stopped by user-initiated actions or critical health events
such as degradation of the underlying hardware.

###### Important

Replacement of tasks within event window is best effort. If you notice tasks being retired outside of your
event windows, consider expanding the duration (8 hours or more) or increasing frequency (at least once every 3 days).

To apply Amazon EC2 event windows to your Fargate task retirements:

- Set the `fargateEventWindows` account setting to `enabled`. You can use one of the following APIs:
`put-account-setting-default` or `put-account-setting` as the root user or an administrative user.
Note that this is a one-time enablement for usage of the Amazon EC2 event windows feature for your Fargate tasks.

- Create an Amazon EC2 event window through the AWS console or the AWS CLI. To create an event window using CLI, use EC2
`create-instance-event-window` API with time ranges or cron expressions. Take note of the
`InstanceEventWindowId` from the response.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-instance-event-window \
                      --time-range StartWeekDay=monday,StartHour=2,EndWeekDay=wednesday,EndHour=8 \
                      --tag-specifications "ResourceType=instance-event-window,Tags=[{Key=K1,Value=V1" \
                      --name myEventWindowName
```

Alternatively, you can use cron expressions when creating EC2 event windows.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-instance-event-window \
                      --cron-expression "* 21-23 * * 2,3" \
                      --tag-specifications "ResourceType=instance-event-window,Tags=[{Key=K1,Value=V1" \
                      --name myEventWindowName
```

- You can then associate the event window with specific services, clusters or all tasks in your account using EC2 `associate-instance-event-window` API.

- For ECS service tasks

```nohighlight

aws ec2 associate-instance-event-window \
  --instance-event-window-id iew-0abcdef1234567890 \
  --association-target "InstanceTags=[{Key=aws:ecs:serviceArn,Value=your-service-arn}]"

```

- For ECS clusters

```nohighlight

aws ec2 associate-instance-event-window \
  --instance-event-window-id iew-0abcdef1234567890 \
  --association-target "InstanceTags=[{Key=aws:ecs:clusterArn,Value=your-cluster-arn}]"

```

- To associate an event window with all tasks in the account

```nohighlight

aws ec2 associate-instance-event-window \
  --instance-event-window-id iew-0abcdef1234567890 \
  --association-target "InstanceTags=[{Key=aws:ecs:fargateTask,Value=true}]"

```

You can use more than one key-value pair to associate an event window with multiple services or clusters.

Fargate will choose the event window for each task in the following order:

- If there is an event window associated with the task's service, it will be used. This is not applicable for standalone
or unmanaged tasks.

- If there is an event window associated with the task's cluster, it will be used.

- If there is an event window set for all Fargate tasks, it will be used.

- The `fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod` setting will be used if none of the event windows match with the task.

**Configuring event windows for Fargate task maintenance**

Consider a case when you are running multiple ECS services on Fargate with different availability requirements. You want precise
control over task retirements. You can configure multiple event windows as follows:

- **Default maintenance for all Fargate tasks**: Create an event window for routine maintenance
during off-peak hours (12AM to 4AM daily) and associate it with all Fargate tasks using the `
                      aws:ecs:fargateTask` tag.

- **Weekend-only maintenance for development cluster**: For a development cluster with services that
can tolerate disruption on weekends, create a 24-hour weekend window (Saturday and Sunday, all day) and associate it with the
cluster using the `aws:ecs:clusterArn` tag with your cluster ARN.

- **Restricted window for mission-critical service**: For a mission-critical payment processing service
that requires high uptime during weekdays, restrict maintenance to weekend early morning hours (Saturday and Sunday, 12AM to 4AM)
and associate it with the specific service using the `aws:ecs:serviceArn` tag with your service ARN.

With this configuration, the payment service uses its specific weekend-only window, the development cluster services and tasks use the weekend
24-hour window, and all other Fargate tasks use the default daily maintenance window.

For more information, see, [put-account-setting-default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/put-account-setting-default.html) and [put-account-setting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/put-account-setting.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference_.

## Step 2: Capture task retirement notifications to alert teams and take actions

When there is an upcoming task retirement, AWS sends a task retirement notification
to the AWS Health Dashboard, and to the primary email contact on the AWS account. The
AWS Health Dashboard provides a number of integrations into other AWS services,
including Amazon EventBridge. You can use EventBridge to build automations from a task retirement
notification, such as increasing the visibility of the upcoming retirement by forwarding
the message to a ChatOps tool. AWS Health Aware is a resource that shows the power of
the AWS Health Dashboard and how notifications can be distributed throughout an
organization. You can forward a task retirement notification to a chat application, such
as Slack.

The following illustration shows the solution overview.

![Diagram showing the Fargate solution to capture Fargate task retirement notices.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/images/fargate-task-retirement-solution.png)

The following information provides details.

- Fargate sends the task retirement notification to the AWS Health
Dashboard.

- The AWS Health Dashboard sends mail to the primary email contact on the
AWS account, and notifies EventBridge.

- EventBridge has a rule that captures the retirement notification.

The rule looking for events with the Event Detail Type: `"AWS Health
                          Event" and the Event Detail Type Code:
                          "AWS_ECS_TASK_PATCHING_RETIREMENT"`

- The rule triggers a Lambda function that forwards the information to Slack
using a Slack Incoming Webhook. For more information, see [Incoming\
Webhooks](https://slack.com/marketplace/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks).

For a code example, see [Capturing AWS Fargate Task Retirement Notifications](https://github.com/aws-samples/capturing-aws-fargate-task-retirement-notifications/tree/main) on Github.

## Step 3: Control the replacement of tasks

You can't control the exact timing of a task retirement, however, you can define a
wait time. If you want control over replacing tasks at your own schedule, you can
capture the task retirement notice to first understand the task retirement date. You can
then redeploy your service to launch replacement tasks, and likewise replace any
standalone tasks.For services that use rolling deployment, you update the service using
`update-service` with the `force-deployment` option before the
retirement start time.

The following `update-service` example uses the
`force-deployment` option.

```nohighlight

aws ecs update-service —-service service_name \
    --cluster cluster_name \
     --force-new-deployment
```

For services that use the blue/green deployment, you need to create a new deployment
in AWS CodeDeploy. For information about how to create the deployment, see [create-deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/create-deployment.html) in the _AWS Command Line Interface_
_Reference_.
