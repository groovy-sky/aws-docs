# AWS managed policies for Amazon Elastic Container Service

To add permissions to users, groups, and roles, it is easier to use AWS managed policies
than to write policies yourself. It takes time and expertise to [create IAM customer\
managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create-console.html) that provide your team with only the permissions they need. To
get started quickly, you can use our AWS managed policies. These policies cover common use
cases and are available in your AWS account. For more information about AWS managed
policies, see [AWS managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) in the _IAM User Guide_.

AWS services maintain and update AWS managed policies. You can't change the
permissions in AWS managed policies. Services occasionally add additional permissions to
an AWS managed policy to support new features. This type of update affects all identities
(users, groups, and roles) where the policy is attached. Services are most likely to update
an AWS managed policy when a new feature is launched or when new operations become
available. Services do not remove permissions from an AWS managed policy, so policy
updates won't break your existing permissions.

Additionally, AWS supports managed policies for job functions that span multiple
services. For example, the **ReadOnlyAccess** AWS managed
policy provides read-only access to all AWS services and resources. When a service
launches a new feature, AWS adds read-only permissions for new operations and resources.
For a list and descriptions of job function policies, see [AWS managed policies for\
job functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

Amazon ECS and Amazon ECR provide several managed policies and trust relationships that you can
attach to users, groups, roles, Amazon EC2 instances, and Amazon ECS tasks that allow differing levels
of control over resources and API operations. You can apply these policies directly, or you
can use them as starting points for creating your own policies. For more information about
the Amazon ECR managed policies, see [Amazon ECR managed\
policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ecr_managed_policies.html).

## AmazonECS\_FullAccess

You can attach the `AmazonECS_FullAccess` policy to your IAM identities.
This policy grants administrative access to Amazon ECS resources and grants an IAM identity
(such as a user, group, or role) access to the AWS services that Amazon ECS is integrated
with to use all of Amazon ECS features. Using this policy allows access to all of Amazon ECS
features that are available in the AWS Management Console.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonECS\_FullAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonECS_FullAccess.html) in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_.

## AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForVolumes

You can attach the `AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForVolumes` managed
policy to your IAM entities.

The policy
grants the permissions that are needed by Amazon ECS to make AWS API calls on your behalf.
You can attach this policy to the IAM role that you provide with your volume
configuration when you launch Amazon ECS tasks and services. The role allows Amazon ECS to manage
volumes attached to your tasks. For more information, see [Amazon ECS\
infrastructure IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/infrastructure_IAM_role.html).

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForVolumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForVolumes.html) in the _AWS Managed Policy_
_Reference_.

## AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role

You can attach the `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role` policy to your
IAM identities. This policy grants administrative permissions that allow Amazon ECS
container instances to make calls to AWS on your behalf. For more information, see
[Amazon ECS container instance IAM role](instance-iam-role.md).

Amazon ECS attaches this policy to a service role that allows Amazon ECS to perform actions on
your behalf against Amazon EC2 instances or external instances.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role.html) in the _AWS Managed Policy_
_Reference_.

### Considerations

You should consider the following recommendations and considerations when using
the `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role` managed IAM policy.

- Following the standard security advice of granting least privilege, you
can modify the `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role` managed
policy to fit your specific needs. If any of the permissions granted in the
managed policy aren't needed for your use case, create a custom policy
and add only the permissions that you require. For example, the
`UpdateContainerInstancesState` permission is provided for
Spot Instance draining. If that permission isn't needed for your use case, exclude it
using a custom policy.

- Containers that are running on your container instances have access to all
of the permissions that are supplied to the container instance role through
[instance\
metadata](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-instance-metadata.md). We recommend that you limit the permissions in your
container instance role to the minimal list of permissions that are provided
in the managed `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role` policy. If
the containers in your tasks need extra permissions that aren't listed, we
recommend providing those tasks with their own IAM roles. For more
information, see [Amazon ECS task IAM role](task-iam-roles.md).

You can prevent containers on the `docker0` bridge from
accessing the permissions supplied to the container instance role. You can
do this while still allowing the permissions that are provided by [Amazon ECS task IAM role](task-iam-roles.md) by running the
following **iptables** command on your container instances.
Containers can't query instance metadata with this rule in effect. This
command assumes the default Docker bridge configuration and it doesn't work
with containers that use the `host` network mode. For more
information, see [Network mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#network_mode).

```nohighlight

sudo yum install -y iptables-services; sudo iptables --insert DOCKER USER 1 --in-interface docker+ --destination 169.254.169.254/32 --jump DROP
```

You must save this **iptables** rule on your container
instance for it to survive a reboot. For the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI, use the
following command. For other operating systems, consult the documentation
for that OS.

- For the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI:

```nohighlight

sudo iptables-save | sudo tee /etc/sysconfig/iptables && sudo systemctl enable --now iptables
```

- For the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux AMI:

```nohighlight

sudo service iptables save
```

## AmazonEC2ContainerServiceEventsRole

You can attach the `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceEventsRole` policy to your
IAM identities. This policy grants permissions that allow Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) to
run tasks on your behalf. This policy can be attached to the IAM role that's specified
when you create scheduled tasks. For more information, see [Amazon ECS EventBridge IAM Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/CWE_IAM_role.html).

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonEC2ContainerServiceEventsRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonEC2ContainerServiceEventsRole.html) in the _AWS Managed Policy_

ChangeDescriptionDate

Update `AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForManagedInstances` policy

The `AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForManagedInstances` policy has been updated with the following permissions to support Capacity Reservations on Amazon ECS Managed Instances:

- `resource-groups:ListGroupResources` permission has been added to allow Amazon ECS to fetch a grouping of capacity reservations. To run this command, the following
permissions are also required: `cloudformation:DescribeStacks`, `cloudformation:ListStackResources`, `tag:GetResources`

- `ec2:DescribeCapacityReservations` permission has been added to allow Amazon ECS to gather details about capacity reservations necessary to integrate with Amazon ECS Managed Instances.

- `ec2:RunInstances` permission has been modified to include Amazon ResourceGroups group resources for Amazon ECS to provision targeted Amazon EC2 capacity reservations.

February 24, 2026

Add permissions to [AmazonECSServiceRolePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html#security-iam-awsmanpol-AmazonECSServiceRolePolicy).

The `AmazonECSServiceRolePolicy` managed IAM
policy was updated to include the `ssmmessages:OpenDataChannel`
permission. This permission allows Amazon ECS to open data channels for ECS Exec sessions.January 20, 2026

Update `AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForManagedInstances` policy

The `AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForManagedInstances` policy has been updated to modify the `CreateFleet` permissions. The resource-based conditions for
subnets, security groups and EC2 images have been removed because:

- Subnets and security groups are not created or managed by Amazon ECS, so they do not contain the required `AmazonECSManaged` tags.

- While Amazon ECS owns and manages EC2 images, the tags are not visible to customers, preventing the application of resource-based policies.

This change ensures that the policy functions correctly with resources that lack the expected ECS management tags.
