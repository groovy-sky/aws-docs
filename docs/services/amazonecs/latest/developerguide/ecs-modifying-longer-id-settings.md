# Modifying Amazon ECS account settings

Modify your account settings to access Amazon ECS features.

The `guardDutyActivate` parameter is read-only in Amazon ECS and indicates whether
Runtime Monitoring is turned on or off by your security administrator in your
Amazon ECS account. GuardDuty controls this account setting on your behalf. For more information, see [Protecting Amazon ECS workloads with Runtime Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-guard-duty-integration.html).
