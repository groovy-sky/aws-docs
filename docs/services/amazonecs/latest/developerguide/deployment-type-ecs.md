# Deploy Amazon ECS services by replacing tasks

When you create a service which uses the _rolling update_
( `ECS`) deployment type, the Amazon ECS service scheduler replaces the currently
running tasks with new tasks. The number of tasks that Amazon ECS adds or removes from the
service during a rolling update is controlled by the service deployment configuration.

Amazon ECS uses the following parameters to determine the number of tasks:

- The `minimumHealthyPercent` represents the lower limit on the number of
tasks that should be running and healthy for a service during a rolling deployment or when a container
instance is draining, as a percent of the desired number of tasks for the service.
This value is rounded up. For example if the minimum healthy percent is
`50` and the desired task count is four, then the scheduler can stop
two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Likewise, if the minimum healthy
percent is 75% and the desired task count is two, then the scheduler can't stop any
tasks due to the resulting value also being two.

- The `maximumPercent` represents the upper limit on the number of tasks
that should be running for a service during a rolling deployment or when a container
instance is draining, as a percent of the desired number of tasks for a service.
This value is rounded down. For example if the maximum percent is `200`
and the desired task count is four, then the scheduler can start four new tasks
before stopping four existing tasks. Likewise, if the maximum percent is
`125` and the desired task count is three, the scheduler can't start
any tasks due to the resulting value also being three.

During a rolling deployment, when tasks become unhealthy, Amazon ECS replaces them to
maintain your service's `minimumHealthyPercent` and protect availability.
Unhealthy tasks are replaced using the same service revision they belong to. This
ensures that unhealthy task replacement in the source revision is independent from
task failures in the target revision. When the `maximumPercent` setting
allows, the scheduler launches replacement tasks before stopping unhealthy ones. If
the `maximumPercent` parameter limits the scheduler from starting a
replacement task first, the scheduler stops one unhealthy task at a time to free
capacity before launching a replacement task.

###### Important

When setting a minimum healthy percent or a maximum percent, you should ensure that
the scheduler can stop or start at least one task when a deployment is initiated. If
your service has a deployment that is stuck due to an invalid deployment configuration,
a service event message will be sent. For more information, see [service (service-name) was unable to stop or start tasks during a deployment because of the service deployment configuration. Update the minimumHealthyPercent or maximumPercent value and try again.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-event-messages-list.html#service-event-messages-7).

Rolling deployments have 2 methods which provide a way to quickly identify when a service
deployment has failed:

- [How the Amazon ECS deployment circuit breaker detects failures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-circuit-breaker.html)

- [How CloudWatch alarms detect Amazon ECS deployment failures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-alarm-failure.html)

The methods can be used separately or together. When both methods are used, the deployment
is set to failed as soon as the failure criteria for either failure method is met.

Use the following guidelines to help determine which method to use:

- Circuit breaker - Use this method when you want to stop a deployment when the
tasks can't start.

- CloudWatch alarms - Use this method when you want to stop a deployment based on
application metrics.

Both methods support rolling back to the previous service revision.

## Container image resolution

By default, Amazon ECS resolves container image tags specified in the task
definition to container image digests. If you create a service that runs and maintains a
single task, that task is used to establish image digests for the containers in the task.
If you create a service that runs and maintains multiple tasks, the first task started
by the service scheduler during deployment is used to establish the image digests for
the containers in the tasks.

If three or more attempts at establishing the container image digests fail, the
deployment continues without image digest resolution. If the deployment circuit breaker
is enabled, the deployment is additionally failed and rolled back.

After the container image digests have been established, Amazon ECS uses the digests to
start any other desired tasks, and for any future service updates. This leads to all
tasks in a service always running identical container images, resulting in version
consistency for your software.

You can configure this behavior for each container in your
task by using the `versionConsistency` parameter in the container definition.
For more information, see [versionConsistency](task-definition-parameters.md#ContainerDefinition-versionconsistency).

###### Note

- Amazon ECS Agent versions lower than `1.31.0` don't support image digest
resolution. Agent versions `1.31.0` to `1.69.0` support image
digest resolution only for images pushed to Amazon ECR repositories. Agent versions
`1.70.0` or higher support image digest resolution for all images.

- The minimum Fargate Linux platform version for image digest resolution is
`1.3.0`. The minimum Fargate Windows platform version for image digest
resolution is `1.0.0`.

- Amazon ECS doesn't capture digests of sidecar containers managed by Amazon ECS, such
as the Amazon GuardDuty security agent or Service Connect proxy.

- To reduce potential latency associated with container image resolution in
services with multiple tasks, run Amazon ECS agent version `1.83.0` or
higher on EC2 container instances. To avoid potential latency, specify container image digests in your task definition.

- If you create a service with a desired task count of zero, Amazon ECS can't
establish container digests until you trigger another deployment of the
service with a desired task count greater than zero.

- To establish updated image digests, you can force a new deployment. The
updated digests will be used to start new tasks and will not affect already
running tasks. For more information about forcing new deployments, see
[forceNewDeployment](../../../../reference/amazonecs/latest/apireference/api-updateservice.md#ECS-UpdateService-request-forceNewDeployment) in the _Amazon ECS API_
_reference_.

- When using EC2 capacity providers, if there is insufficient capacity to
start a task during the initial deployment, software version consistency may
fail. To ensure version consistency is maintained even when capacity is
limited, explicitly set `versionConsistency: "enabled"` in your task
definition container configuration rather than relying on the default
behavior. This causes Amazon ECS to wait until capacity becomes available before
proceeding with the deployment.
