# Amazon ECS task definitions for AWS Neuron machine learning workloads

You can register [Amazon EC2\
Trn1](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/trn1), [Amazon EC2\
Trn2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/trn2), [Amazon EC2\
Inf1](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf1), and [Amazon EC2\
Inf2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf2) instances to your clusters for machine learning workloads.

Amazon EC2 Trn1 and Trn2 instances are powered by [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium) chips. These instances
provide high performance and low cost training for machine learning in the cloud. You
can train a machine learning inference model using a machine learning framework with
AWS Neuron on a Trn1 or Trn2 instance. Then, you can run the model on a Inf1 instance, or an
Inf2 instance to use the acceleration of the AWS Inferentia chips.

The Amazon EC2 Inf1 instances and Inf2 instances are powered by [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/inferentia) chips They provide high
performance and lowest cost inference in the cloud.

Machine learning models are deployed to containers using [AWS Neuron](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/neuron), which is a specialized Software
Developer Kit (SDK). The SDK consists of a compiler, runtime, and profiling tools that
optimize the machine learning performance of AWS machine learning chips. AWS Neuron
supports popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Apache
MXNet.

## Considerations

Before you begin deploying Neuron on Amazon ECS, consider the following:

- Your clusters can contain a mix of Trn1, Trn2, Inf1, Inf2 and other
instances.

- You need a Linux application in a container that uses a machine learning
framework that supports AWS Neuron.

###### Important

Applications that use other frameworks might not have improved
performance on Trn1, Trn2, Inf1, and Inf2 instances.

- Only one inference or inference-training task can run on each [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium)
or [AWS\
Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/inferentia) chip. For Inf1, each chip has 4 NeuronCores. For Trn1,
Trn2, and Inf2 each chip has 2 NeuronCores. You can run as many tasks as there are
chips for each of your Trn1, Trn2, Inf1, and Inf2 instances.

- When creating a service or running a standalone task, you can use instance
type attributes when you configure task placement constraints. This ensures
that the task is launched on the container instance that you specify. Doing
so can help you optimize overall resource utilization and ensure that tasks
for inference workloads are on your Trn1, Trn2, Inf1, and Inf2 instances. For more
information, see [How Amazon ECS places tasks on container instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-placement.html).

In the following example, a task is run on an `Inf1.xlarge`
instance on your `default` cluster.

```nohighlight

aws ecs run-task \
       --cluster default \
       --task-definition ecs-inference-task-def \
       --placement-constraints type=memberOf,expression="attribute:ecs.instance-type == Inf1.xlarge"
```

- Neuron resource requirements can't be defined in a task definition.
Instead, you configure a container to use specific AWS Trainium or AWS
Inferentia chips available on the host container instance. Do this by using
the `linuxParameters` parameter and specifying the device
details. For more information, see [Task definition requirements](#ecs-inference-requirements).

## Use the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2023 (Neuron) AMI

Amazon ECS provides an Amazon ECS optimized AMI that's based on Amazon Linux 2023 for AWS Trainium
and AWS Inferentia workloads. It comes with the AWS Neuron drivers and runtime
for Docker. This AMI makes running machine learning inference workloads easier on
Amazon ECS.

We recommend using the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2023 (Neuron) AMI when launching your Amazon EC2 Trn1, Inf1, and Inf2
instances.

You can retrieve the current Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2023 (Neuron) AMI using the AWS CLI with the following
command.

```nohighlight

aws ssm get-parameters --names /aws/service/ecs/optimized-ami/amazon-linux-2023/neuron/recommended
```

## Task definition requirements

To deploy Neuron on Amazon ECS, your task definition must contain the container
definition for a pre-built container serving the inference model for TensorFlow.
It's provided by AWS Deep Learning Containers. This container contains the AWS Neuron runtime and
the TensorFlow Serving application. At startup, this container fetches your model
from Amazon S3, launches Neuron TensorFlow Serving with the saved model, and waits for
prediction requests. In the following example, the container image has TensorFlow
1.15 and Ubuntu 18.04. A complete list of pre-built Deep Learning Containers optimized for Neuron is
maintained on GitHub. For more information, see [Using\
AWS Neuron TensorFlow Serving](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/tutorial-inferentia-tf-neuron-serving.html).

```

763104351884.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tensorflow-inference-neuron:1.15.4-neuron-py37-ubuntu18.04
```

Alternatively, you can build your own Neuron sidecar container image. For more
information, see [Tutorial: Neuron TensorFlow Serving](https://github.com/aws-neuron/aws-neuron-sdk/blob/master/frameworks/tensorflow/tensorflow-neuron/tutorials/tutorials-tensorflow-utilizing-neuron-capabilities.rst) in the _AWS Deep Learning AMIs Developer Guide_.

The task definition must be specific to a single instance type. You must configure
a container to use specific AWS Trainium or AWS Inferentia devices that are
available on the host container instance. You can do so using the
`linuxParameters` parameter. For a sample task definition, see
[Specifying AWS Neuron machine learning in an Amazon ECS task definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-inference-task-def.html). The following table details the chips
that are specific to each instance type.
