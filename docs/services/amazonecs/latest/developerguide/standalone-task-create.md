# Running an application as an Amazon ECS task

You can create a task for a one-time process using the AWS Management Console.

###### To create a standalone task (AWS Management Console)

01. Open the console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2).

02. The Amazon ECS console allows you to create a standalone task from either your cluster
     detail page or from the task definition revision list. Use the following steps to
     create your standalone task depending on the resource page you choose.

    To start a service fromSteps

    The cluster detail page

1. On the **Clusters** page, select the
    cluster to create the service in.

2. From the **Tasks** tab, choose
    **Run task**.

The task definition revision page

1. On the **Task definitions** page,
    choose the task definition family to display the
    revisions for that family.

2. Select the revision you want to use.

3. From the **Deploy** menu, choose
    **Run task**.

03. For **Existing cluster**, choose the cluster.

    Choose **Create cluster** to run the task on a new
     cluster

04. Choose how your tasks are distributed across your cluster infrastructure. Under
     **Compute configuration**, choose your option.To use a capacity
     provider strategy, you must configure your capacity providers at the cluster level.

    If you haven't configured your cluster to use a capacity provider, use a launch
     type instead.

    If you want to run your workloads on Amazon ECS Managed Instances, you must use the Capacity provider strategy option.

    Distribution methodSteps

    Capacity provider strategy

1. In the **Compute options** section,
    select **Capacity provider**
**strategy**.

2. Choose a strategy:

- To use the cluster's default capacity provider
strategy, choose **Use cluster**
**default**.

- If your cluster doesn't have a default
capacity provider strategy, or to use a custom
strategy, choose **Use custom**,
**Add capacity provider**
**strategy** and define your custom
capacity provider strategy by specifying a
**Base**, **Capacity**
**provider**, and
**Weight**.

###### Note

To use a capacity provider in a strategy, the capacity
provider must be associated with the cluster.

Launch type

1. In the **Compute options** section,
    select **Launch type**.

2. For **Launch type**, choose a launch
    type.

3. (Optional) When you use Fargate,
    for **Platform version**,
    specify the platform version to use. If a platform
    version isn't specified, the `LATEST`
    platform version is used.

05. Under **Deployment configuration**, do the following:
    1. For **Task definition**, enter the task
        definition.

       ###### Important

       The console validates the selection to ensure that the selected task
       definition family and revision are compatible with the defined compute
       configuration.

    2. For **Desired tasks**, enter the number of tasks to
        launch.

    3. For **Task group**, enter the task group name.
06. If your task definition uses the `awsvpc` network mode, expand
     **Networking**. Use the following steps to specify a custom
     configuration.
    1. For **VPC**, select the VPC to use.

    2. For **Subnets**, select one or more subnets in the VPC
        that the task scheduler considers when placing your tasks.

    3. For **Security group**, you can either choose an existing
        security group or create a new one. To use an existing security group,
        choose the security group and move to the next step. To create a new
        security group, choose **Create a new security group**. You
        must specify a security group name, description, and then add one or more
        inbound rules for the security group.

    4. For **Public IP**, choose whether to auto-assign a public
        IP address to the elastic network interface (ENI) of the task.

       AWS Fargate tasks can be assigned a public IP address when run in a
        public subnet so they have a route to the internet. EC2 tasks
        can't be assigned a public IP using this field. For more information, see
        [Amazon ECS\
        task networking options for Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/fargate-task-networking.html) and [Allocate a network interface for an Amazon ECS task.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking-awsvpc.html).
07. If your task uses a data volume that's compatible with configuration at
     deployment, you can configure the volume by expanding
     **Volume**.

    The volume name and volume type are configured when creating a task definition
     revision and can't be changed when you run a standalone task. To update the volume
     name and type, you must create a new task definition revision and run a task by
     using the new revision.

    To configure this volume typeDo this

    Amazon EBS

01. For **EBS volume type**, choose the
     type of EBS volume that you want to attach to your
     task.

02. For **Size (GiB)**, enter a valid
     value for the volume size in gibibytes (GiB). You can
     specify a minimum of 1 GiB and a maximum of 16,384 GiB
     volume size. This value is required unless you provide a
     snapshot ID.

03. For **IOPS**, enter the maximum
     number of input/output operations (IOPS) that the volume
     should provide. This value is configurable only for
     `io1`, `io2`, and
     `gp3` volume types.

04. For **Throughput (MiB/s)**, enter the
     throughput that the volume should provide, in mebibytes
     per second (MiBps, or MiB/s). This value is configurable
     only for the `gp3` volume type.

05. For **Snapshot ID**, choose an
     existing Amazon EBS volume snapshot or enter the ARN of a
     snapshot if you want to create a volume from a snapshot.
     You can also create a new, empty volume by not choosing
     or entering a snapshot ID.

06. If you specify a **Snapshot ID**, you
     can specify a **Volume initialization rate**
    **(MiB/s)**. Enter a value between 100 and
     300, in MiB/s, that will determine how fast data is
     loaded from the snapshot specified using
     **Snapshot ID** for volume
     creation.

07. For **Termination policy**, deselect
     the checkbox if you want the volume configured for
     attachment to the task to be preserved after the task is
     terminated. By default, EBS volumes that are attached to
     tasks are deleted when the task is terminated.

08. For **File system type**, choose the
     type of file system that will be used for data storage
     and retrieval on the volume. You can choose either the
     operating system default or a specific file system type.
     The default for Linux is `XFS`. For volumes
     created from a snapshot, you must specify the same
     filesystem type that the volume was using when the
     snapshot was created. If there is a filesystem type
     mismatch, the task will fail to start.

09. For **Infrastructure role**, choose
     an IAM role with the necessary permissions that allow
     Amazon ECS to manage Amazon EBS volumes for tasks. You can attach
     the
     `AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForVolumes`
     managed policy to the role, or you can use the policy as
     a guide to create and attach an your own policy with
     permissions that meet your specific needs. For more
     information about the necessary permissions, see see
     [Amazon ECS infrastructure IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/infrastructure_IAM_role.html).

10. For **Encryption**, choose
     **Default** if you want to use the
     Amazon EBS encryption by default settings. If your account
     has [Encryption by default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/encryption-by-default.html) configured, the
     volume will be encrypted with the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key
     that's specified in the setting. If you choose
     **Default** and Amazon EBS default
     encryption isn't turned on, the volume will be
     unencrypted.

    If you choose **Custom**, you can
     specify an AWS KMS key of your choice for volume
     encryption.

    If you choose **None**, the volume
     will be unencrypted unless you have encryption by
     default configured, or if you create a volume from an
     encrypted snapshot.

11. If you've chosen **Custom** for
     **Encryption**, you must specify
     the AWS KMS key that you want to use. For
     **KMS key**, choose an
     AWS KMS key or enter a key ARN. If you choose to
     encrypt your volume by using a symmetric customer managed key,
     make sure that you have the right permissions defined in
     your AWS KMS key policy. For more information, see
     [Data encryption for Amazon EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ebs-volumes.html?icmpid=docs_ecs_hp-deploy#ebs-kms-encryption).

12. (Optional) Under **Tags**, you can
     add tags to your Amazon EBS volume by either propagating tags
     from the task definition or by providing your own
     tags.

     If you want to propagate tags from the task
     definition, choose **Task definition**
     for **Propagate tags from**. If you
     choose **Do not propagate**, or if you
     don't choose a value, the tags aren't propagated.

    If you want to provide your own tags, choose
     **Add tag** and then provide the
     key and value for each tag you add.

    For more information about tagging Amazon EBS volumes, see
     [Tagging Amazon EBS volumes](specify-ebs-config.md#ebs-volume-tagging).

08. (Optional) To use a task placement strategy other than the
     default, expand **Task Placement**, and then choose
     from the following options.

     For more information, see [How Amazon ECS places tasks on container instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-placement.html).

- **AZ Balanced Spread** – Distribute tasks
across Availability Zones and across container instances in
the Availability Zone.

- **AZ Balanced BinPack** – Distribute
tasks across Availability Zones and across container
instances with the least available memory.

- **BinPack** – Distribute tasks based on
the least available amount of CPU or memory.

- **One Task Per Host** – Place, at most,
one task from the service on each container instance.

- **Custom** – Define your own task placement strategy.

If you chose **Custom**, define the algorithm for placing tasks and the rules that are considered during task placement.

- Under **Strategy**, for **Type** and **Field**, choose the algorithm and the entity to use for the algorithm.

You can enter a maximum of 5 strategies.

- Under **Constraint**, for **Type** and **Expression**, choose the rule and attribute for the constraint.

For example, to set the constraint to place tasks on T2 instances, for the **Expression**, enter **attribute:ecs.instance-type =~ t2.\***.

You can enter a maximum of 10 constraints.

09. (Optional) To override the task IAM role, or task execution role that is defined
     in your task definition, expand **Task overrides**, and then
     complete the following steps:
    1. For **Task role**, choose an IAM role for this task.
        For more information, see [Amazon ECS task IAM role](task-iam-roles.md).

       Only roles with the `ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com` trust
        relationship are displayed. For instructions on how to create an IAM role
        for your tasks, see [Creating the task IAM role](task-iam-roles.md#create_task_iam_policy_and_role).

    2. For **Task execution role**, choose a task execution
        role. For more information, see [Amazon ECS task execution IAM role](task-execution-iam-role.md).
10. (Optional) To override the container commands and environment variables, expand **Container Overrides**, and then expand the container.

- To send a command to the container other than the task definition command, for **Command**
**override**, enter the Docker command.

- To add an environment variable, choose **Add**
**Environment Variable**. For
**Key**, enter the name of your
environment variable. For
**Value**, enter a string value for
your environment value (without the surrounding
double quotation marks ( `" "`)).

AWS surrounds the strings with double quotation
marks (" ") and passes the string to the container
in the following format:

```

MY_ENV_VAR="This variable contains a string."
```

11. (Optional) To help identify your task, expand the **Tags**
     section, and then configure your tags.

    To have Amazon ECS automatically tag all newly launched tasks with the cluster name and the task definition tags, select **Turn on Amazon ECS managed tags**, and then select **Task definitions**.

    Add or remove a tag.

- \[Add a tag\] Choose **Add tag**, and then do the following:

- For **Key**, enter the key
name.

- For **Value**, enter the
key value.

- \[Remove a tag\] Next to the tag, choose
**Remove tag**.

12. Choose **Create**.
