# Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMIs

###### Important

The Amazon ECS-Optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI reaches end-of-life on June 30, 2026, mirroring the same EOL date
of the upstream Amazon Linux 2 operating system (for more information, see the [Amazon Linux 2 FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/faqs)). We encourage customers to upgrade
their applications to use Amazon Linux 2023, which includes long term support through
2028\. For information about migrating from Amazon Linux 2 to Amazon Linux 2023, see [Migrating from the Amazon Linux 2 Amazon ECS-optimized AMI to the Amazon Linux 2023 Amazon ECS-optimized AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/al2-to-al2023-ami-transition.html).

By default, the deprecation date of all Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs are set to two years after the AMI creation date.
You can use the Amazon EC2
`DescribeImages` API to check the deprecation status and date of an AMI. For
more information, see [DescribeImages](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference/api-describeimages.md) in the
_Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API Reference_.

Amazon ECS provides the Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs that are preconfigured with the requirements and
recommendations to run your container workloads. We recommend that you use the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2023 AMI
for your Amazon EC2 instances. Launching your container instances from the most recent
Amazon ECS-Optimized AMI ensures that you receive the current security updates and container
agent version. For information about how to launch an instance, see [Launching an Amazon ECS Linux container instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html).

When you create a cluster using the console, Amazon ECS creates a launch template for
your instances with the latest AMI associated with the selected operating system.

When you use CloudFormation to create a cluster, the SSM parameter is part of the Amazon EC2
launch template for the Auto Scaling group instances. You can configure the template to use a
dynamic Systems Manager parameter to determine what Amazon ECS Optimized AMI to deploy. This
parameter ensures that each time you deploy the stack it will check to see if there
is available update that needs to be applied to the EC2 instances. For an example of
how to use the Systems Manager parameter, see [Create an Amazon ECS cluster with the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2023 AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ecs-cluster.html#aws-resource-ecs-cluster--examples--Create_an_cluster_with_the_Amazon_Linux_2023_ECS-Optimized-AMI) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

If you need to customize the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI, see [Amazon ECS Optimized AMI Build Recipes](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-ami) on
GitHub.

The following variants of the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI are available for your Amazon EC2 instances
with the Amazon Linux 2023 operating system.

Amazon ECS provides a changelog for the Linux variant of the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI on GitHub.
For more information, see [Changelog](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-ami/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

The Linux variants of the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI use the Amazon Linux 2 AMI or Amazon Linux 2023 AMI as
their base. You can retrieve the AMI name for each
variant by querying the Systems Manager Parameter Store API. For more information, see [Retrieving Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/retrieve-ecs-optimized_AMI.html). The
Amazon Linux 2 AMI release notes are available as well. For more information, see [Amazon Linux 2 release notes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AL2/latest/relnotes/relnotes-al2.html). The
Amazon Linux 2023 release notes are available as well. For more information see, [Amazon Linux 2023 release\
notes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/linux/al2023/release-notes/relnotes.html).

The following pages provide additional information about the changes:

## Applying security updates to the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI

The Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs based on Amazon Linux contain a customized version of
cloud-init. Cloud-init is a package that is used to
bootstrap Linux images in a cloud computing environment and perform desired actions when
launching an instance. By default, all Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs based on Amazon Linux released
before June 12, 2024 have all "Critical" and "Important" security updates applied upon
instance launch.

Beginning with the June 12, 2024 releases of the Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs based on
Amazon Linux 2, the default behavior will no longer include updating packages at launch. Instead,
we recommend that you update to a new Amazon ECS-optimized AMI as releases are made
available. The Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs are released when there are available security
updates or base AMI changes. This will ensure you are receiving the latest package
versions and security updates, and that the package versions are immutable through
instance launches. For more information on retrieving the latest Amazon ECS-optimized AMI,
see [Retrieving Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/retrieve-ecs-optimized_AMI.html).

We recommend automating your environment to update to a new AMI as they are made
available. For information about the available options, see [Amazon ECS enables easier EC2 capacity management, with managed instance\
draining](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-ecs-enables-easier-ec2-capacity-management-with-managed-instance-draining).

To continue applying "Critical" and "Important" security updates manually on an AMI
version, you can run the following command on your Amazon EC2 instance.

```nohighlight

yum update --security
```

###### Warning

Updating docker or containerd packages will stop all running containers on the host,
which means all running Amazon ECS tasks will be stopped. Plan accordingly to minimize
service disruption.

If you want to re-enable security updates at launch, you can add the following line to
the `#cloud-config` section of the cloud-init user data when launching your
Amazon EC2 instance. For more information, see [Using cloud-init on Amazon Linux 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/linux/al2/ug/amazon-linux-cloud-init.html) in
the _Amazon Linux User Guide_.

```nohighlight

## Version-locked packages in Amazon ECS-optimized AL2023 GPU AMIs

Certain packages are critical for correct, performant behavior of GPU functionality in Amazon ECS-optimized AL2023 GPU AMIs. These include:

- NVIDIA drivers ( `nvidia*`)

- Kernel modules ( `kmod*`)

- NVIDIA libraries ( `libnvidia*`)

- Kernel packages ( `kernel*`)

###### Note

This is not an exhaustive list. The complete list of locked packages are available with `dnf versionlock list`

These packages are version-locked to ensure stability and prevent unintentional changes that could disrupt GPU workloads. As a result, these packages should generally be modified within the bounds of a managed process that gracefully handles potential issues and maintains GPU functionality.

To prevent unintended modifications, the `dnf versionlock` plugin is used on these packages.

If you wish to modify a locked package, you can:

```

# unlock a single package
sudo dnf versionlock delete $PACKAGE_NAME

# unlock all packages
sudo dnf versionlock clear
```

###### Important

When updates to these packages are necessary, customers should consider using the latest AMI version that includes the required updates. If updating existing instances is required, a careful approach involving unlocking, updating, and re-locking packages should be employed, always ensuring GPU functionality is maintained throughout the process.
