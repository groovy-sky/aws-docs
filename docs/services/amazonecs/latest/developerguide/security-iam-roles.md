# Best practices for IAM roles in Amazon ECS

The roles Amazon ECS requires depend on the task definition launch type and the features that
you use. We recommend that you create separate roles in the table instead of sharing
roles.

RoleDefinitionWhen requiredMore informationTask execution roleThis role allows Amazon ECS to use other AWS services on your behalf.

Your task is hosted on AWS Fargate
or on external instances and:

- pulls a container image from an Amazon ECR private
repository.

- pulls a container image from an Amazon ECR private
repository in a different account from the account that
runs the task.

- sends container logs to CloudWatch Logs using the
`awslogs` log driver.

Your task is hosted on either AWS Fargate or Amazon EC2 instances
and:

- uses private registry authentication.

- uses Runtime Monitoring.

- the task definition references sensitive data using
Secrets Manager secrets or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
parameters.

- You want to attach Amazon EBS volumes to your Fargate or EC2 launch
type Amazon ECS tasks. The infrastructure role allows Amazon ECS to manage Amazon EBS volumes for
your tasks.

- You want to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt traffic between your
Amazon ECS Service Connect services.

- You want to create VPC Lattice target groups.

## Task role

We recommend that you assign a task role. Its role can be distinguished from
the role of the Amazon EC2 instance that it's running on. Assigning each task a role
aligns with the principle of least privileged access and allows for greater granular
control over actions and resources.

When you add a task role to a task definition, the Amazon ECS container agent automatically
creates a token with a unique credential ID (for example,
`12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef`) for the task. This token and the role
credentials are then added to the agent's internal cache. The agent populates the
environment variable `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` in the
container with the URI of the credential ID (for example,
`/v2/credentials/12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef`).

You can manually retrieve the temporary role credentials from inside a container by
appending the environment variable to the IP address of the Amazon ECS container agent and
running the `curl` command on the resulting string.

```

curl 169.254.170.2$AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI
```

The expected output is as follows:

```JSON

{
	"RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/SSMTaskRole-SSMFargateTaskIAMRole-DASWWSF2WGD6",
	"AccessKeyId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
	"SecretAccessKey": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
	"Token": "IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEEM/Example==",
	"Expiration": "2021-01-16T00:51:53Z"
}

```

Newer versions of the AWS SDKs automatically fetch these credentials from the
`AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` environment variable when making
AWS API calls. For information about how to renew credentials, see [Renewing AWS credentials](https://repost.aws/questions/QUgcf1EIOPS7GZNboeAiyO9Q/renewing-aws-credentials) on rePost.

The output includes an access key-pair consisting of a secret access key ID and a
secret key which your application uses to access AWS resources. It also includes a
token that AWS uses to verify that the credentials are valid. By default, credentials
assigned to tasks using task roles are valid for six hours. After that, they are
automatically rotated by the Amazon ECS container agent.

## Task execution role

The task execution role is used to grant the Amazon ECS container agent permission to
call specific AWS API actions on your behalf. For example, when you use
AWS Fargate, Fargate needs an IAM role that allows it to pull images from
Amazon ECR and write logs to CloudWatch Logs. An IAM role is also required when a task references
a secret that's stored in AWS Secrets Manager, such as an image pull secret.

###### Note

If you're pulling images as an authenticated user, you're less likely to be
impacted by the changes that occurred to [Docker\
Hub's pull rate limits](https://www.docker.com/pricing/resource-consumption-updates). For more information see, [Private registry authentication for container instances](private-auth-container-instances.md).

By using Amazon ECR and Amazon ECR Public, you can avoid the limits imposed by Docker.
If you pull images from Amazon ECR, this also helps shorten network pull times and
reduces data transfer changes when traffic leaves your VPC.

###### Important

When you use Fargate, you must authenticate to a private image registry
using `repositoryCredentials`. It's not possible to set the Amazon ECS
container agent environment variables `ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE` or
`ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_DATA` or modify the `ecs.config` file
for tasks hosted on Fargate. For more information, see [Private registry authentication for tasks](private-auth.md).

## Container instance role

The `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role` managed IAM policy includes the
following permissions. Following the standard security advice of granting least
privilege, the `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role` managed policy can be
used as a guide. If you don't need any of the permissions that are granted in the
managed policy for your use case, create a custom policy and add only the permissions
that you need.

- `ec2:DescribeTags` – (Optional) Allows a principal to
describe the tags that are associated with an Amazon EC2 instance. This permission is
used by the Amazon ECS container agent to support resource tag propagation. For more
information, see [How resources are tagged](ecs-using-tags.md#tag-resources).

- `ecs:CreateCluster` – (Optional) Allows a principal to
create an Amazon ECS cluster. This permission is used by the Amazon ECS container agent to
create a `default` cluster, if one doesn't already exist.

- `ecs:DeregisterContainerInstance` – (Optional) Allows a
principal to deregister an Amazon ECS container instance from a cluster. The Amazon ECS
container agent doesn't call this API operation, but this permission
remains to help ensure backwards compatibility.

- `ecs:DiscoverPollEndpoint` – (Required) This action returns
endpoints that the Amazon ECS container agent uses to poll for updates.

- `ecs:Poll` – (Required) Allows the Amazon ECS container agent to
communicate with the Amazon ECS control plane to report task state changes.

- `ecs:RegisterContainerInstance` – (Required) Allows a
principal to register a container instance with a cluster. This permission is
used by the Amazon ECS container agent to register the Amazon EC2 instance with a cluster
and to support resource tag propagation.

- `ecs:StartTelemetrySession` – (Optional) Allows the Amazon ECS
container agent to communicate with the Amazon ECS control plane to report health
information and metrics for each container and task.

Although this permission is not required, we recommend that you add it to
allowthe container instance metrics to start scale actions and also receive
reports related to health check commands.

- `ecs:TagResource` – (Optional) Allows the Amazon ECS container
agent to tag cluster on creation and to tag container instances when they are
registered to a cluster.

- `ecs:UpdateContainerInstancesState` – Allows a principal to
modify the status of an Amazon ECS container instance. This permission is used by the
Amazon ECS container agent for Spot Instance draining.

- `ecs:Submit*` – (Required) This includes the
`SubmitAttachmentStateChanges`,
`SubmitContainerStateChange`, and
`SubmitTaskStateChange` API actions. They're used by the Amazon ECS
container agent to report state changes for each resource to the Amazon ECS control
plane. The `SubmitContainerStateChange` permission is no longer used
by the Amazon ECS container agent but remains to help ensure backwards
compatibility.

- `ecr:GetAuthorizationToken` – (Optional) Allows a principal
to retrieve an authorization token. The authorization token represents your
IAM authentication credentials and can be used to access any Amazon ECR registry
that the IAM principal has access to. The authorization token received is
valid for 12 hours.

- `ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability` – (Optional) When a
container image is pushed to an Amazon ECR private repository, each image layer is
checked to verify if it's already pushed. If it is, then the image layer is
skipped.

- `ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer` – (Optional) When a container
image is pulled from an Amazon ECR private repository, this API is called once for
each image layer that's not already cached.

- `ecr:BatchGetImage` – (Optional) When a container image is
pulled from an Amazon ECR private repository, this API is called once to retrieve the
image manifest.

- `logs:CreateLogStream` – (Optional) Allows a principal to
create a CloudWatch Logs log stream for a specified log group.

- `logs:PutLogEvents` – (Optional) Allows a principal to
upload a batch of log events to a specified log stream.

## Service-linked roles

You can use the service-linked role for Amazon ECS to grant the Amazon ECS service
permission to call other service APIs on your behalf. Amazon ECS needs the permissions to
create and delete network interfaces, register, and de-register targets with a
target group. It also needs the necessary permissions to create and delete scaling
policies. These permissions are granted through the service-linked role. This role
is created on your behalf the first time that you use the service.

###### Note

If you inadvertently delete the service-linked role, you can recreate it. For
instructions, see [Create the service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html#create-service-linked-role).

## Roles recommendations

We recommend that you do the following when setting up your task IAM roles and
policies.

### Block access to Amazon EC2 metadata

When you run your tasks on Amazon EC2 instances, we strongly recommend that you
block access to Amazon EC2 metadata to prevent your containers from inheriting the
role assigned to those instances. If your applications have to call an AWS API
action, use IAM roles for tasks instead.

To prevent tasks running in **bridge** mode from
accessing Amazon EC2 metadata, run the following command or update the instance's
user data. For more instruction on updating the user data of an instance, see
this [AWS Support Article](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ecs-container-ec2-metadata). For more information about the task
definition bridge mode, see [task definition network mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#network_mode).

```bash

sudo yum install -y iptables-services; sudo iptables --insert FORWARD 1 --in-interface docker+ --destination 169.254.169.254/32 --jump DROP
```

For this change to persist after a reboot, run the following command that's
specific for your Amazon Machine Image (AMI):

- Amazon Linux 2

```bash

sudo iptables-save | sudo tee /etc/sysconfig/iptables && sudo systemctl enable --now iptables
```

- Amazon Linux

```bash

sudo service iptables save
```

For tasks that use `awsvpc` network mode, set the environment
variable `ECS_AWSVPC_BLOCK_IMDS` to `true` in the
`/etc/ecs/ecs.config` file.

You should set the `ECS_ENABLE_TASK_IAM_ROLE_NETWORK_HOST` variable
to `false` in the `ecs-agent config` file to prevent the containers
that are running within the `host` network from accessing the Amazon EC2
metadata.

### Use the `awsvpc` network mode

Use the network `awsvpc` network mode to restrict the flow of
traffic between different tasks or between your tasks and other services that
run within your Amazon VPC. This adds an additional layer of security. The
`awsvpc` network mode provides task-level network isolation for
tasks that run on Amazon EC2. It is the default mode on AWS Fargate. it's the only
network mode that you can use to assign a security group to tasks.

### Use last accessed information to refine roles

We recommend that you remove any actions that were never used or haven't been
used for some time. This prevents unwanted access from happening. To do this,
review last accessed information provided by IAM, and then remove actions
that were never used or haven't been used recently. You can do this by following
the following steps.

Run the following command to generate a report showing the last access
information for the referenced policy:

```bash

aws iam generate-service-last-accessed-details --arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/ExamplePolicy1
```

use the `JobId` that was in the output to run the following
command. After you do this, you can view the results of the report.

```bash

aws iam get-service-last-accessed-details --job-id 98a765b4-3cde-2101-2345-example678f9
```

For more information, see [Refine permissions in AWS using last accessed information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_last-accessed.html).

### Monitor AWS CloudTrail for suspicious activity

You can monitor AWS CloudTrail for any suspicious activity. Most AWS API calls are
logged to AWS CloudTrail as events. They are analyzed by AWS CloudTrail Insights, and you're
alerted of any suspicious behavior that's associated with `write` API
calls. This might include a spike in call volume. These alerts include such
information as the time the unusual activity occurred and the top identity
ARN that contributed to the APIs.

You can identify actions that are performed by tasks with an IAM role in
AWS CloudTrail by looking at the event's `userIdentity` property. In the
following example, the `arn` includes of the name of the assumed
role, `s3-write-go-bucket-role`, followed by the name of the task,
`7e9894e088ad416eb5cab92afExample`.

```JSON

"userIdentity": {
    "type": "AssumedRole",
    "principalId": "AROA36C6WWEJ2YEXAMPLE:7e9894e088ad416eb5cab92afExample",
    "arn": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/s3-write-go-bucket-role/7e9894e088ad416eb5cab92afExample",
    ...
}
```

###### Note

When tasks that assume a role are run on Amazon EC2 container instances, a
request is logged by Amazon ECS container agent to the audit log of the agent
that's located at an address in the
`/var/log/ecs/audit.log.YYYY-MM-DD-HH` format. For more
information, see [Task\
IAM Roles Log](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/logs.html#task_iam_roles-logs) and [Logging Insights Events for Trails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.html).
