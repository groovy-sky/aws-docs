# Add workgroups to a reservation

After you create a capacity reservation, you can add up to 20 workgroups to the
reservation. Adding a workgroup to a reservation tells Athena which queries should
execute on your reserved capacity. Queries from workgroups that are not associated
with a reservation continue to run using the default per terabyte (TB) scanned
pricing model.

When a reservation has two or more workgroups, queries from those workgroups can
use the reservation's capacity. You can add and remove workgroups at any time. When
you add or remove workgroups, queries that are running are not interrupted.

When your reservation is in a pending state, queries from workgroups that you have
added continue to run using the default per terabyte (TB) scanned pricing model
until the reservation becomes active.

###### To add one or more workgroups to your capacity reservation

1. On the details page for the capacity reservation, choose **Add**
**workgroups**.

2. On the **Add workgroups** page, select the workgroups
    that you want to add, and then choose **Add workgroups**.
    You cannot assign a workgroup to more than one reservation.

The details page for your capacity reservation lists the workgroups that
    you added. Queries that run in those workgroups will use the capacity that
    you reserved when the reservation is active.
