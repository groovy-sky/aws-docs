# Amazon Athena IBM Db2 AS/400 (Db2 iSeries) connector
<a name="connectors-ibm-db2-as400"></a>

The Amazon Athena connector for Db2 AS/400 enables Amazon Athena to run SQL queries on your IBM Db2 AS/400 (Db2 iSeries) databases using JDBC.

This connector can be registered with Glue Data Catalog as a federated catalog. It supports data access controls defined in Lake Formation at the catalog, database, table, column, row, and tag levels. This connector uses Glue Connections to centralize configuration properties in Glue.

## Prerequisites
<a name="connectors-db2as400-prerequisites"></a>
+ Deploy the connector to your AWS account using the Athena console or the AWS Serverless Application Repository. For more information, see [Create a data source connection](connect-to-a-data-source.md) or [Use the AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy a data source connector](connect-data-source-serverless-app-repo.md).
+ Set up a VPC and a security group before you use this connector. For more information, see [Create a VPC for a data source connector or AWS Glue connection](athena-connectors-vpc-creation.md).

## Limitations
<a name="connectors-ibm-db2-as400-limitations"></a>
+ Write DDL operations are not supported.
+ In a multiplexer setup, the spill bucket and prefix are shared across all database instances.
+ Any relevant Lambda limits. For more information, see [Lambda quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html) in the *AWS Lambda Developer Guide*.
+ Date and timestamp data types in filter conditions must be cast to appropriate data types.

## Terms
<a name="connectors-ibm-db2-as400-terms"></a>

The following terms relate to the Db2 AS/400 connector.
+ **Database instance** – Any instance of a database deployed on premises, on Amazon EC2, or on Amazon RDS.
+ **Handler** – A Lambda handler that accesses your database instance. A handler can be for metadata or for data records.
+ **Metadata handler** – A Lambda handler that retrieves metadata from your database instance.
+ **Record handler** – A Lambda handler that retrieves data records from your database instance.
+ **Composite handler** – A Lambda handler that retrieves both metadata and data records from your database instance.
+ **Property or parameter** – A database property used by handlers to extract database information. You configure these properties as Lambda environment variables.
+ **Connection String** – A string of text used to establish a connection to a database instance.
+ **Catalog** – A non-AWS Glue catalog registered with Athena that is a required prefix for the `connection_string` property.
+ **Multiplexing handler** – A Lambda handler that can accept and use multiple database connections.

## Parameters
<a name="connectors-ibm-db2-as400-parameters"></a>

Use the parameters in this section to configure the Db2 AS/400 connector.

**Note**
Athena data source connectors created on December 3, 2024 and later use AWS Glue connections.
The parameter names and definitions listed below are for Athena data source connectors created prior to December 3, 2024. These can differ from their corresponding [AWS Glue connection properties](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/connection-properties.html). Starting December 3, 2024, use the parameters below only when you [manually deploy](connect-data-source-serverless-app-repo.md) an earlier version of an Athena data source connector.

### AWS Glue Data Catalog federated connectors
<a name="connectors-ibm-db2-as400-gc"></a>

We recommend that you configure a Db2 AS/400 connector by using a Glue connections object. To do this, set the `glue_connection` environment variable of the Db2 AS/400 connector Lambda to the name of the Glue connection to use.

**Glue connections properties**

Use the following command to get the schema for a Glue connection object. This schema contains all the parameters that you can use to control your connection.

```
aws glue describe-connection-type --connection-type DB2AS400
```

**Lambda environment properties**

The following Lambda environment properties apply only when you use the connector with a Lambda function in your account.
+ **glue\_connection** – Specifies the name of the Glue connection associated with the federated connector.
+ **casing\_mode** – (Optional) Specifies how to handle casing for schema and table names. The `casing_mode` parameter uses the following values to specify the behavior of casing:
  + **none** – Do not change case of the given schema and table names. This is the default for connectors that have an associated glue connection.
  + **upper** – Upper case all given schema and table names.
  + **lower** – Lower case all given schema and table names.

**Note**
All connectors that use a AWS Glue Data Catalog federated connection must use AWS Secrets Manager to store credentials.
The Db2 AS/400 connector created using a AWS Glue Data Catalog federated connection does not support the use of a multiplexing handler.
The Db2 AS/400 connector created using a AWS Glue Data Catalog federated connection only supports `ConnectionSchemaVersion` 2.

### Athena data catalog federated connectors
<a name="connectors-ibm-db2-as400-legacy"></a>

#### Connection string
<a name="connectors-ibm-db2-as400-connection-string"></a>

Use a JDBC connection string in the following format to connect to a database instance.

```
db2as400://${{{jdbc_connection_string}}}
```

#### Using a multiplexing handler
<a name="connectors-ibm-db2-as400-using-a-multiplexing-handler"></a>

You can use a multiplexer to connect to multiple database instances with a single Lambda function. Requests are routed by catalog name. Use the following classes in Lambda.

| Handler | Class |
| --- | --- |
| Composite handler | Db2MuxCompositeHandler |
| Metadata handler | Db2MuxMetadataHandler |
| Record handler | Db2MuxRecordHandler |

##### Multiplexing handler parameters
<a name="connectors-ibm-db2-as400-multiplexing-handler-parameters"></a>

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ${{catalog}}\_connection\_string | Required. A database instance connection string. Prefix the environment variable with the name of the catalog used in Athena. For example, if the catalog registered with Athena is mydb2as400catalog, then the environment variable name is mydb2as400catalog\_connection\_string. |
| default | Required. The default connection string. This string is used when the catalog is lambda:${{{AWS\_LAMBDA\_FUNCTION\_NAME}}}. |

The following example properties are for a Db2 MUX Lambda function that supports two database instances: `db2as4001` (the default), and `db2as4002`.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| default | db2as400://jdbc:as400://{{<ip\_address>}};{{<properties>}};:${{{<secret name>}}}; |
| db2as400\_catalog1\_connection\_string | db2as400://jdbc:as400://db2as4001.hostname/:${{{secret1\_name}}} |
| db2as400\_catalog2\_connection\_string | db2as400://jdbc:as400://db2as4002.hostname/:${{{secret2\_name}}} |
| db2as400\_catalog3\_connection\_string | db2as400://jdbc:as400://{{<ip\_address>}};user={{<username>}};password={{<password>}};{{<properties>}}; |

##### Providing credentials
<a name="connectors-ibm-db2-as400-providing-credentials"></a>

To provide a user name and password for your database in your JDBC connection string, you can use connection string properties or AWS Secrets Manager.
+ **Connection String** – A user name and password can be specified as properties in the JDBC connection string.
**Important**
As a security best practice, don't use hardcoded credentials in your environment variables or connection strings. For information about moving your hardcoded secrets to AWS Secrets Manager, see [Move hardcoded secrets to AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/hardcoded.html) in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide*.
+ **AWS Secrets Manager** – To use the Athena Federated Query feature with AWS Secrets Manager, the VPC connected to your Lambda function should have [internet access](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/internet-access-lambda-function/) or a [VPC endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoint-overview.html) to connect to Secrets Manager.

  You can put the name of a secret in AWS Secrets Manager in your JDBC connection string. The connector replaces the secret name with the `username` and `password` values from Secrets Manager.

  For Amazon RDS database instances, this support is tightly integrated. If you use Amazon RDS, we highly recommend using AWS Secrets Manager and credential rotation. If your database does not use Amazon RDS, store the credentials as JSON in the following format:

  ```
  {"username": "${username}", "password": "${password}"}
  ```

**Example connection string with secret name**
The following string has the secret name `${secret_name}`.

```
db2as400://jdbc:as400://{{<ip_address>}};{{<properties>}};:${{{<secret_name>}}};
```

The connector uses the secret name to retrieve secrets and provide the user name and password, as in the following example.

```
db2as400://jdbc:as400://{{<ip_address>}};user={{<username>}};password={{<password>}};{{<properties>}};
```

#### Using a single connection handler
<a name="connectors-ibm-db2-as400-using-a-single-connection-handler"></a>

You can use the following single connection metadata and record handlers to connect to a single Db2 AS/400 instance.

| Handler type | Class |
| --- | --- |
| Composite handler | Db2CompositeHandler |
| Metadata handler | Db2MetadataHandler |
| Record handler | Db2RecordHandler |

##### Single connection handler parameters
<a name="connectors-ibm-db2-as400-single-connection-handler-parameters"></a>

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| default | Required. The default connection string. |

The single connection handlers support one database instance and must provide a `default` connection string parameter. All other connection strings are ignored.

The following example property is for a single Db2 AS/400 instance supported by a Lambda function.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| default | db2as400://jdbc:as400://{{<ip\_address>}};{{<properties>}};:${{{<secret\_name>}}}; |

#### Spill parameters
<a name="connectors-ibm-db2-as400-spill-parameters"></a>

The Lambda SDK can spill data to Amazon S3. All database instances accessed by the same Lambda function spill to the same location.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| spill\_bucket | Required. Spill bucket name. |
| spill\_prefix | Required. Spill bucket key prefix. |
| spill\_put\_request\_headers | (Optional) A JSON encoded map of request headers and values for the Amazon S3 putObject request that is used for spilling (for example, {"x-amz-server-side-encryption" : "AES256"}). For other possible headers, see [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference. |

## Data type support
<a name="connectors-ibm-db2-as400-data-type-support"></a>

The following table shows the corresponding data types for JDBC and Apache Arrow.

| Db2 AS/400 | Arrow |
| --- | --- |
| CHAR | VARCHAR |
| VARCHAR | VARCHAR |
| DATE | DATEDAY |
| TIME | VARCHAR |
| TIMESTAMP | DATEMILLI |
| DATETIME | DATEMILLI |
| BOOLEAN | BOOL |
| SMALLINT | SMALLINT |
| INTEGER | INT |
| BIGINT | BIGINT |
| DECIMAL | DECIMAL |
| REAL | FLOAT8 |
| DOUBLE | FLOAT8 |
| DECFLOAT | FLOAT8 |

## Partitions and splits
<a name="connectors-ibm-db2-as400-partitions-and-splits"></a>

A partition is represented by one or more partition columns of type `varchar`. The Db2 AS/400 connector creates partitions using the following organization schemes.
+ Distribute by hash
+ Partition by range
+ Organize by dimensions

The connector retrieves partition details such as the number of partitions and column name from one or more Db2 AS/400 metadata tables. Splits are created based upon the number of partitions identified.

## Performance
<a name="connectors-db2-as400-performance"></a>

For improved performance, use predicate pushdown to query from Athena, as in the following examples.

```
SELECT * FROM "lambda:{{<LAMBDA_NAME>}}"."{{<SCHEMA_NAME>}}"."{{<TABLE_NAME>}}"
 WHERE integercol = 2147483647
```

```
SELECT * FROM "lambda: {{<LAMBDA_NAME>}}"."{{<SCHEMA_NAME>}}"."{{<TABLE_NAME>}}"
 WHERE timestampcol >= TIMESTAMP '2018-03-25 07:30:58.878'
```

## Passthrough queries
<a name="connectors-db2as400-passthrough-queries"></a>

The Db2 AS/400 connector supports [passthrough queries](federated-query-passthrough.md). Passthrough queries use a table function to push your full query down to the data source for execution.

To use passthrough queries with Db2 AS/400, you can use the following syntax:

```
SELECT * FROM TABLE(
        system.query(
            query => '{{query string}}'
        ))
```

The following example query pushes down a query to a data source in Db2 AS/400. The query selects all columns in the `customer` table, limiting the results to 10.

```
SELECT * FROM TABLE(
        system.query(
            query => 'SELECT * FROM customer LIMIT 10'
        ))
```
