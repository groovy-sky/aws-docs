# Query S3 Express One Zone data

The Amazon S3 Express One Zone storage class is a highly performant Amazon S3 storage class that provides single-digit
millisecond response times. As such, it is useful for applications that frequently access
data with hundreds of thousands of requests per second.

S3 Express One Zone replicates and stores data within the same Availability Zone to optimize for
speed and cost. This differs from Amazon S3 Regional storage classes, which automatically
replicate data across a minimum of three AWS Availability Zones within an
AWS Region.

For more information, see [What is S3 Express One Zone?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-one-zone.html) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

## Prerequisites

Confirm that the following conditions are met before you begin:

- **Athena engine version 3** – To use S3 Express One Zone with Athena SQL, your
workgroup must be configured to use Athena engine version 3.

- S3 Express One Zone permissions – When
S3 Express One Zone calls an action like `GET`, `LIST`, or
`PUT` on an Amazon S3 object, the storage class calls
`CreateSession` on your behalf. For this reason, your IAM
policy must allow the `s3express:CreateSession` action, which allows
Athena to invoke the corresponding API operation.

## Considerations and limitations

When you query S3 Express One Zone with Athena, consider the following points.

- S3 Express One Zone buckets supports `SSE_S3` and `SSE-KMS`
encryption. Athena query results are written using `SSE_S3` encryption
regardless of the option that you choose in workgroup settings to encrypt query
results. This limitation includes all scenarios in which Athena writes data to
S3 Express One Zone buckets, including `CREATE TABLE AS` (CTAS) and
`INSERT INTO` statements.

- The AWS Glue crawler is not supported for creating tables on S3 Express One Zone
data.

- The `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` statement is not supported. As a
workaround, use [ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION](alter-table-add-partition.md).

- No table modifying DDL statements for Apache Iceberg (that is, no `ALTER
                          TABLE` statements) are supported for S3 Express One Zone.

- Lake Formation is not supported with S3 Express One Zone buckets.

- The following file and table formats are unsupported or have limited support.
If formats aren't listed, but are supported for Athena (such as Parquet, ORC, and
JSON), then they're also supported for use with S3 Express One Zone storage.

supported.

## Get started

Querying S3 Express One Zone data with Athena is straightforward. To get started, use the
following procedure.

###### To use Athena SQL to query S3 Express One Zone data

1. Transition your data to S3 Express One Zone storage. For more information, see [Setting\
    the storage class of an object](../../../s3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.md#sc-howtoset) in the
    _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

2. Use a [CREATE TABLE](create-table.md) statement in
    Athena to catalog your data in AWS Glue Data Catalog. For information about creating tables
    in Athena, see [Create tables in Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/creating-tables.html)
    and the [CREATE TABLE](create-table.md)
    statement.

3. (Optional) Configure the query result location of your Athena workgroup to use
    an Amazon S3 _directory bucket_. Amazon S3 directory buckets are more
    performant that general buckets and are designed for workloads or
    performance-critical applications that require consistent single-digit
    millisecond latency. For more information, see [Directory\
    buckets overview](../../../s3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-overview.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.
