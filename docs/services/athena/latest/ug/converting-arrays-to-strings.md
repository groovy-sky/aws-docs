# Convert arrays to strings

To convert an array into a single string, use the `array_join` function. The
following standalone example creates a table called `dataset` that contains an
aliased array called `words`. The query uses `array_join` to join the
array elements in `words`, separate them with spaces, and return the resulting
string in an aliased column called `welcome_msg`.

```sql

WITH
dataset AS (
  SELECT ARRAY ['hello', 'amazon', 'athena'] AS words
)
SELECT array_join(words, ' ') AS welcome_msg
FROM dataset
```

This query returns:

```

+---------------------+
| welcome_msg         |
+---------------------+
| hello amazon athena |
+---------------------+
```
