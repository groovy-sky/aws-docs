# Use the cost-based optimizer

You can use the cost-based optimizer (CBO) feature in Athena SQL to optimize your queries.
You can optionally request that Athena gather table or column-level statistics for one of
your tables in AWS Glue. If all of the tables in your query have statistics, Athena uses the
statistics to create an execution plan that it determines to be the most performant. The
query optimizer calculates alternative plans based on a statistical model and then selects
the one that will likely be the fastest to run the query.

Statistics on AWS Glue tables are collected and stored in the AWS Glue Data Catalog and made available
to Athena for improved query planning and execution. These statistics are column-level
statistics such as number of distinct, number of null, max, and min values on file types
such as Parquet, ORC, JSON, ION, CSV, and XML. Amazon Athena uses these statistics to optimize
queries by applying the most restrictive filters as early as possible in query processing.
This filtering limits memory usage and the number of records that must be read to deliver
the query results.

In conjunction with CBO, Athena uses a feature called the rule-based optimizer (RBO). RBO
mechanically applies rules that are expected to improve query performance. RBO is generally
beneficial because its transformations aim to simplify the query plan. However, because RBO
does not perform cost calculations or plan comparisons, more complicated queries make it
difficult for RBO to create an optimal plan.

For this reason, Athena uses both RBO and CBO to optimize your queries. After Athena
identifies opportunities to improve query execution, it creates an optimal plan. For
information about execution plan details, see [View execution plans for SQL queries](query-plans.md). For a detailed discussion of how CBO works, see [Speed up queries with the cost-based optimizer in Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/speed-up-queries-with-cost-based-optimizer-in-amazon-athena) in the the AWS
Big Data Blog.

To generate statistics for AWS Glue Catalog tables, you can use the Athena console, the AWS Glue
Console, or AWS Glue APIs. Because Athena is integrated with AWS Glue Catalog, you automatically
get the corresponding query performance improvements when you run queries from
Amazon Athena.

## Considerations and limitations

- Table types – Currently, the CBO feature
in Athena supports only Hive and Iceberg tables that are in the
AWS Glue Data Catalog.

- Athena for Spark – The CBO feature is not
available in Athena for Spark.

- Pricing – For pricing information, visit
the [AWS Glue pricing\
page](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing).

## Generate table statistics using the Athena console

This section describes how to use the Athena console to generate table or column-level
statistics for a table in AWS Glue. For information on using AWS Glue to generate table
statistics, see [Working with column statistics](../../../glue/latest/dg/column-statistics.md) in the
_AWS Glue Developer Guide_.

###### To generate statistics for a table using the Athena console

1. Open the Athena console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

2. In the Athena query editor **Tables** list, choose the three
    vertical dots for the table that you want, and then choose **Generate**
**statistics**.

![Context menu for a table in the Athena query editor.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/cost-based-optimizer-1.png)

3. In the **Generate statistics** dialog box, choose
    **All columns** to generate statistics for all columns in
    the table, or choose **Selected columns** to select specific
    columns. **All columns** is the default setting.

4. For **AWS Glue service role**, create or select an existing
    service role to give permission to AWS Glue to generate statistics. The AWS Glue
    service role also requires [`S3:GetObject`](../../../s3/latest/api/api-getobject.md) permissions to the Amazon S3 bucket that
    contains the table's data.

5. Choose **Generate statistics**. A **Generating**
**statistics for `table_name`** notification
    banner displays the task status.

6. To view details in the AWS Glue console, choose **View in**
**Glue**.

For information about viewing statistics in the AWS Glue console, see [Viewing\
    column statistics](../../../glue/latest/dg/view-column-stats.md) in the _AWS Glue Developer Guide_.

7. After statistics have been generated, the tables and columns that have
    statistics show the word **Statistics** in parentheses, as in
    the following image.

Now when you run your queries, Athena will perform cost-based optimization on the
tables and columns for which statistics were generated.

## Enable and disable the table statistics

When you generate table statistics for an Iceberg table following the steps in
previous section, a Glue table property called `use_iceberg_statistics` is
automatically added to the Iceberg table in AWS Glue Data Catalog and set to
**true** by default. If you remove this property or set it to
**false**, CBO will not use the Iceberg table statistics when
trying to optimize the query plan during query execution, even if the statistics were
generated by Glue. For more information onhow to generate table statistics, see [Generate table statistics using the Athena console](#cost-based-optimizer-generating-table-statistics-using-the-athena-console).

In contrast, Hive tables in the Glue Data Catalog do not have a similar table property
to enable or disable the use of table statistics for CBO. As a result, CBO always uses
the table statistics generated by Glue when trying to optimize the query plan for Hive
tables.
