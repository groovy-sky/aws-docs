# Register S3 table bucket catalogs and query Tables from Athena

Amazon S3 table buckets are a bucket type in Amazon S3 that is purpose-built to store tabular
data in Apache Iceberg tables. Table buckets automate table management tasks such as
compaction, snapshot management, and garbage collection to continuously optimize query
performance and minimize cost. Whether you're just starting out, or have thousands of
tables in your Iceberg environment, table buckets simplify data lakes at any scale. For
more information, see [Table buckets](../../../s3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-buckets.md).

## Considerations and limitations

- All DDL operations supported for Iceberg tables are supported for S3
Tables with the following exceptions:

- `ALTER TABLE RENAME`, `CREATE VIEW`, and
`ALTER DATABASE` are not supported.

- `OPTIMIZE` and `VACUUM` – You can
manage compaction and snapshot management in S3. For more
information, see [S3\
Tables maintenance documentation](../../../s3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-maintenance.md).

- DDL queries on S3 Tables registered as Athena data sources are not
supported.

- Query result reuse is not supported.

- In workgroups with SSE-KMS, CSE-KMS encryption enabled, you can't run write
operations like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`,
`DELETE`, or `MERGE` on S3 Tables.

- In workgroups with S3 Requester Pays option enabled, you can't run DML
operations on S3 Tables.

## Query S3 Tables from Athena

###### Complete these prerequisite steps before you query S3 Tables in Athena

1. Create an S3 table bucket. For more information, see [Creating a\
    table bucket](../../../s3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-buckets-create.md) in Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.

2. Make sure that the integration of your table buckets with AWS Glue Data Catalog is
    successful. For required permissions and setup steps, see
    [Prerequisites for S3 Tables integration](../../../glue/latest/dg/s3tables-catalog-prerequisites.md) and
    [Enabling S3 Tables integration with Glue Data Catalog](../../../glue/latest/dg/enable-s3-tables-catalog-integration.md) in
    the AWS Glue Developer Guide.

3. For the principal you use to run queries with Athena, grant permissions on the S3 Table
    catalog using one of the following approaches:

**Option 1: Use IAM permissions**

When using IAM access control, your principal needs permissions on both
    AWS Glue Data Catalog resources and Amazon S3 Tables resources.

The following list contains all `s3tables` permissions required to perform any supported DDL or DML operation against your S3 Tables in Athena:

- `s3tables:GetTableBucket`

- `s3tables:GetNamespace`

- `s3tables:GetTable`

- `s3tables:GetTableData`

- `s3tables:PutTableData`

- `s3tables:ListNamespaces`

- `s3tables:ListTables`

- `s3tables:DeleteNamespace`

- `s3tables:DeleteTable`

- `s3tables:CreateNamespace`

- `s3tables:CreateTable`

- `s3tables:UpdateTableMetadataLocation`

Apply these permissions to specific S3 table bucket and S3 Table resources or use `*` as the resource to grant access to all table buckets and tables in your account. These permissions can be combined with the [`AmazonAthenaFullAccess`](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/amazonathenafullaccess.md) managed policy to enable complete functionality.

**Option 2: Use Lake Formation permissions**

Alternatively, to enable fine-grained access control you can grant Lake Formation
permissions on the S3 Table catalog, either through the Lake Formation console or
AWS CLI. This requires registering your S3 table buckets as a Lake Formation data
location. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon S3 Tables catalog in the AWS Glue Data Catalog](../../../lake-formation/latest/dg/create-s3-tables-catalog.md) in
the Lake Formation Developer Guide.
AWS Management Console

1. Open the AWS Lake Formation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/lakeformation/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lakeformation) and sign in as a data lake
    administrator. For more information on how to create a
    data lake administrator, see [Create a data lake administrator](../../../lake-formation/latest/dg/initial-lf-config.md#create-data-lake-admin).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Data**
**permissions** and then choose
    **Grant**.

3. On the **Grant Permissions** page,
    under **Principals**, choose the
    principal that you want to use to submit query from
    Athena.

4. Under **LF-Tags or catalog**
**resources**, choose **Named Data**
**Catalog resources**.

5. For **Catalogs**, choose a glue data
    catalog that you created from the integration of your
    table bucket. For example,
    `<accoundID>`:s3tablescatalog/ `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`.

6. For **Catalog permissions**, choose
    **Super**.

7. Choose **Grant**.

AWS CLI

Run the following command with Lake Formation data lake administrator
role to grant access to the principal that you use to submit
query from Athena.

```nohighlight

aws lakeformation grant-permissions \
--region <region (Example,us-east-1)> \
--cli-input-json \
'{
    "Principal": {
        "DataLakePrincipalIdentifier": "<user or role ARN (Example, arn:aws:iam::<Account ID>:role/ExampleRole>"
    },
    "Resource": {
        "Catalog": {
            "Id":"<Account ID>:s3tablescatalog/amzn-s3-demo-bucket"
        }
    },
    "Permissions": ["ALL"]
}'
```

###### Submit queries for S3 Tables

1. Submit a `CREATE DATABASE` query from Athena with the above granted user/role. In
    this example, `s3tablescatalog` is the parent Glue Data Catalog
    created from the integration and `
                                   s3tablescatalog/amzn-s3-demo-bucket`
    is the child Glue Data Catalog created for each S3 table bucket. There are
    two ways in which you can query.
Option 1

Specify the child Glue Data Catalog
( `s3tablescatalog/amzn-s3-demo-bucket`)
directly from console or AWS CLI.

**Using AWS Management Console**

1. Open the Athena console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena).

2. In the left navigation, for **Data source**
**name**, choose
    **AwsDataCatalog**.

3. For **Catalog**, choose
    **s3tablescatalog/ `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`**.

4. In the query editor, enter a query like
    `CREATE DATABASE
                                           test_namespace`.

**Using AWS CLI**

Run the following command.

```nohighlight

aws athena start-query-execution \
--query-string 'CREATE DATABASE `test_namespace`' \
--query-execution-context '{"Catalog": "s3tablescatalog/amzn-s3-demo-bucket"}' \
--work-group "primary"
```

Option 2

Create Athena data catalog from the child Glue Data Catalog in the Athena console and specify
it as a catalog in the query. For more information, see [Register S3 table bucket catalogs as Athena data sources](#gdc-register-s3-table-console-steps).

2. With the database that you created in previous step, use `CREATE
                               TABLE` to create a table. The following example creates a table in
    the `test_namespace` database that you
    previously created in the
    `s3tablescatalog/amzn-s3-demo-bucket`
    Glue catalog.
AWS Management Console

1. In the left navigation, for **Data source**
**name**, choose
    **AwsDataCatalog**.

2. For **Catalog**, choose
    **s3tablescatalog/ `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`**.

3. For **Database**, choose
    **test\_namespace**.

4. In the query editor, run the following query.

```nohighlight

CREATE TABLE daily_sales (
           sale_date date,
           product_category
           string, sales_amount double)
PARTITIONED BY (month(sale_date))
TBLPROPERTIES ('table_type' = 'iceberg')
```

AWS CLI

Run the following command.

```nohighlight

aws athena start-query-execution \
--query-string "CREATE TABLE daily_sales (
        sale_date date,
        product_category
        string, sales_amount double)
PARTITIONED BY (month(sale_date))
TBLPROPERTIES ('table_type' = 'iceberg')" \
--query-execution-context '{"Catalog": "s3tablescatalog/amzn-s3-demo-bucket", "Database":"test_namespace"}' \
--work-group "primary"
```

3. Insert data into the table that you created in the previous step.
AWS Management Console

1. In the left navigation, for **Data source**
**name**, choose
    **AwsDataCatalog**.

2. For **Catalog**, choose
    **s3tablescatalog/ `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`**.

3. For **Database**, choose
    **test\_namespace**.

4. In the query editor, run the following query.

```nohighlight

INSERT INTO daily_sales
VALUES
       (DATE '2024-01-15', 'Laptop', 900.00),
       (DATE '2024-01-15', 'Monitor', 250.00),
       (DATE '2024-01-16', 'Laptop', 1350.00),
       (DATE '2024-02-01', 'Monitor', 300.00);
```

AWS CLI

Run the following command.

```nohighlight

aws athena start-query-execution \
--query-string "INSERT INTO \"s3tablescatalog/amzn-s3-demo-bucket\".test_namespace.daily_sales
VALUES
(DATE '2024-01-15', 'Laptop', 900.00),
(DATE '2024-01-15', 'Monitor', 250.00),
(DATE '2024-01-16', 'Laptop', 1350.00),
(DATE '2024-02-01', 'Monitor', 300.00)"\
--work-group "primary"
```

4. After inserting data into the table, you can query it.
AWS Management Console

1. In the left navigation, for **Data source**
**name**, choose
    **AwsDataCatalog**.

2. For **Catalog**, choose
    **s3tablescatalog/ `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`**.

3. For **Database**, choose
    **test\_namespace**.

4. In the query editor, run the following query.

```nohighlight

SELECT
       product_category,
       COUNT(*) AS units_sold,
       SUM(sales_amount) AS total_revenue,
       AVG(sales_amount) AS average_price
FROM
       daily_sales
WHERE
       sale_date BETWEEN DATE '2024-02-01'
                    AND DATE '2024-02-29'
GROUP BY
       product_category
ORDER BY
       total_revenue DESC
```

AWS CLI

Run the following command.

```nohighlight

aws athena start-query-execution \
--query-string "SELECT product_category,
    COUNT(*) AS units_sold,
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_revenue,
    AVG(sales_amount) AS average_price
FROM \"s3tablescatalog/amzn-s3-demo-bucket\".test_namespace.daily_sales
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN DATE '2024-02-01' AND DATE '2024-02-29'
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC"\
--work-group "primary"
```

## Create S3 Tables in Athena

Athena supports creating tables in existing S3 Table namespaces or namespaces
created in Athena with `CREATE DATABASE` statements. To create an S3 Table
from Athena, the syntax is the same as when you [create a regular Iceberg table](querying-iceberg-creating-tables.md)
except you don't specify the `LOCATION`, as shown in the following
example.

```

CREATE TABLE
[db_name.]table_name (col_name data_type [COMMENT col_comment] [, ...] )
[PARTITIONED BY (col_name | transform, ... )]
[TBLPROPERTIES ([, property_name=property_value] )]
```

You can also create S3 Tables using CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) statements. For
more information, see [CTAS for S3 Tables](#ctas-s3-tables).

## Register S3 table bucket catalogs as Athena data sources

To register S3 table bucket catalogs with the Athena console, perform the following
steps.

01. Open the Athena console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Data sources and catalogs**.

03. On the **Data sources and catalogs** page, choose **Create data**
    **source**.

04. For **Choose a data source**, choose **Amazon S3 -**
    **AWS Glue Data Catalog**.

05. In the **AWS Glue Data Catalog** section, for **Data source**
    **account**, choose **AWS Glue Data Catalog in this**
    **account**.

06. For **Create a table or register a catalog**, choose
     **Register a new AWS Glue Catalog**.

07. In the **Data source details** section, for **Data**
    **source name**, enter the name that you want to use to specify the
     data source in your SQL queries or use the default name that is
     generated.

08. For **Catalog**, choose **Browse** to search
     for a list of AWS Glue catalogs in the same account. If you don't see any existing
     catalogs, create one in [AWS Glue console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue).

09. In the **Browse AWS Glue catalogs** dialog box, select the
     catalog that you want to use, and then choose
     **Choose**.

10. (Optional) For **Tags**, enter any key/value pairs that you
     want to associate with the data source.

11. Choose **Next**.

12. On the **Review and create** page, verify that the
     information that you entered is correct, and then choose **Create data**
    **source**.

## CTAS for S3 Tables

Amazon Athena now supports CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) operations for S3 Tables. This
feature enables you to create new S3 Tables based on the results of a SELECT query.

When creating a CTAS query for an S3 Table, there are a few important differences compared
to standard Athena tables:

- You must omit the location property because S3 Tables automatically manage their
own storage locations.

- The `table_type` property defaults to `ICEBERG`, so you
don't need to explicitly specify it in your query.

- If you don't specify a format, the system automatically uses `PARQUET`
as the default format for your data.

- All other properties follow the same syntax as regular Iceberg tables.

Before you create S3 Tables using CTAS, ensure that you have the necessary
permissions configured in IAM or AWS Lake Formation. Specifically, you need permissions to create
tables in the S3 Tables catalog. Without these permissions, your CTAS operations
will fail.

###### Note

If your CTAS query fails, you might have to delete your table using the [S3\
Tables API](../../../s3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-delete.md) before attempting to re-run your query. you cannot use the Athena
`DROP TABLE` statements to remove the table that was partially created by
the query.

**Example**

```sql

CREATE TABLE "s3tablescatalog/amzn-s3-demo-bucket"."namespace"."s3-table-name"
WITH (
    format = 'PARQUET'
)
AS SELECT *
FROM source_table;
```
