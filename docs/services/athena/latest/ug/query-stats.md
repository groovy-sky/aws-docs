# View statistics and execution details for completed queries

After you run a query, you can get statistics on the input and output data processed, see
a graphical representation of the time taken for each phase of the query, and interactively
explore execution details.

###### To view query statistics for a completed query

1. After you run a query in the Athena query editor, choose the **Query**
**stats** tab.

![Choose Query stats.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/query-stats-1.png)

The **Query stats** tab provides the following
    information:

- Data processed – Shows you the
number of input rows and bytes processed, and the number of rows and bytes
output.

- The Total runtime – Shows the total
amount of time the query took to run and a graphical representation of how
much of that time was spent on queuing, planning, execution, and service
processing.

###### Note

Stage-level input and output row count and data size information are not shown
when a query has row-level filters defined in Lake Formation.

2. To interactively explore information about how the query ran, choose
    **Execution details**.

![Choose Execution details.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/query-stats-2.png)

The **Execution details** page shows the execution ID for the
    query and a graph of the zero-based stages in the query. The stages are ordered
    start to finish from bottom to top. Each stage's label shows the amount of time the
    stage took to run.

###### Note

The total runtime and execution stage time of a query often differ
significantly. For example, a query with a total runtime in minutes can show an
execution time for a stage in hours. Because a stage is a logical unit of
computation executed in parallel across many tasks, the execution time of a
stage is the aggregate execution time of all of its tasks. Despite this
discrepancy, stage execution time can be useful as a relative indicator of which
stage was most computationally intensive in a query.

To navigate the graph, use the following options:

- To zoom in or out, scroll the mouse, or use the magnifying icons.

- To adjust the graph to fit the screen, choose the **Zoom to**
**fit** icon.

- To move the graph around, drag the mouse pointer.

3. To see more details for a stage, choose the stage. The stage details pane on the
    right shows the number of rows and bytes input and output, and an operator
    tree.

4. To see the stage details full width, choose the expand icon at the top right of
    the details pane.

5. To get information about the parts of the stage, expand one or more items in the
    operator tree.
