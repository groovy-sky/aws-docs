# Allow access for ML with Athena

IAM principals who run Athena ML queries must be allowed to perform the
`sagemaker:invokeEndpoint` action for Sagemaker endpoints that they use.
Include a policy statement similar to the following in identity-based permissions
policies attached to user identities. In addition, attach the [AWS managed policy: AmazonAthenaFullAccess](security-iam-awsmanpol.md#amazonathenafullaccess-managed-policy), which grants full access to
Athena actions, or a modified inline policy that allows a subset of actions.

Replace
`arn:aws:sagemaker:region:AWSAcctID:ModelEndpoint`
in the example with the ARN or ARNs of model endpoints to be used in queries. For more
information, see [Actions,\
resources, and condition keys for SageMaker AI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonsagemaker.html) in the
_Service Authorization Reference_.

```json

{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sagemaker:invokeEndpoint"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:sagemaker:us-west-2:123456789012:workteam/public-crowd/default"
}

```

Whenever you use IAM policies, make sure that you follow IAM best practices. For more information, see [Security best practices in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.
