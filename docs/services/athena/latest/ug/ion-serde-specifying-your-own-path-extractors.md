# Specify your own path extractors
<a name="ion-serde-specifying-your-own-path-extractors"></a>

If your Amazon Ion fields do not map neatly to Hive columns, you can specify your own path extractors. In the `WITH SERDEPROPERTIES` clause of your `CREATE TABLE` statement, use the following syntax.

```
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
   "ion.path_extractor.case_sensitive" = "{{<Boolean>}}",
   "ion.{{<column_name>}}.path_extractor" = "{{<path_extractor_expression>}}"
)
```

**Note**
By default, path extractors are case insensitive. To override this setting, set the [ion.path_extractor.case_sensitive](ion-serde-using-ion-serde-properties.md#ioncase) SerDe property to `true`.
