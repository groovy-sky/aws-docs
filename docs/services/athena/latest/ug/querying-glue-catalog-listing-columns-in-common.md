<a name="querying-glue-catalog-listing-columns-in-common"></a>

You can list the columns that specific tables in a database have in common.
+ Use the syntax `SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns`.
+ For the `WHERE` clause, use the syntax `WHERE table_name IN ('table1', 'table2')`.

**Example – Listing common columns for two tables in the same database**
The following example query lists the columns that the tables `table1` and `table2` have in common.

```
SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name IN ('table1', 'table2')
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
