# Create a query output location

If you do not already have a query output location set up in Amazon S3, perform the
following prerequisite steps to do so.

###### To create a query output location

1. Using the same AWS Region and account that you are using for Athena, follow
    the steps (for example, by using the Amazon S3 console) to [create a bucket in Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket.html) to
    hold your Athena query results. You will configure this bucket to be your query
    output location.

2. Open the Athena console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

3. If this is your first time to visit the Athena console in this AWS Region,
    choose **Explore the query editor** to open the query editor.
    Otherwise, Athena opens in the query editor.

4. Choose **Edit Settings** to set up a query result location in
    Amazon S3.

5. For **Manage settings**, do one of the following:

- In the **Location of query result** box, enter the
path to the bucket that you created in Amazon S3 for your query results.
Prefix the path with `s3://`.

- Choose **Browse S3**, choose the Amazon S3 bucket that you
created for your current Region, and then choose
**Choose**.
