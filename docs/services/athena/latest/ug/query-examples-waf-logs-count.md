# Count referrers, IP addresses, or matched rules
<a name="query-examples-waf-logs-count"></a>

The examples in this section query for counts of log items of interest.
+ [Count the number of referrers that contain a specified term](#waf-example-count-referrers-with-specified-term)
+ [Count all matched IP addresses in the last 10 days that have matched excluded rules](#waf-example-count-matched-ip-addresses)
+ [Group all counted managed rules by the number of times matched](#waf-example-group-managed-rules-by-times-matched)
+ [Group all counted custom rules by number of times matched](#waf-example-group-custom-rules-by-times-matched)

**Example – Count the number of referrers that contain a specified term**
The following query counts the number of referrers that contain the term "amazon" for the specified date range.

```
WITH test_dataset AS
  (SELECT header FROM waf_logs
    CROSS JOIN UNNEST(httprequest.headers) AS t(header) WHERE "date" >= '2021/03/01'
    AND "date" < '2021/03/31')
SELECT COUNT(*) referer_count
FROM test_dataset
WHERE LOWER(header.name)='referer' AND header.value LIKE '%amazon%'
```

**Example – Count all matched IP addresses in the last 10 days that have matched excluded rules**
The following query counts the number of times in the last 10 days that the IP address matched the excluded rule in the rule group.

```
WITH test_dataset AS
  (SELECT * FROM waf_logs
    CROSS JOIN UNNEST(rulegrouplist) AS t(allrulegroups))
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS count,
  "httprequest"."clientip",
  "allrulegroups"."excludedrules",
  "allrulegroups"."ruleGroupId"
FROM test_dataset
WHERE allrulegroups.excludedrules IS NOT NULL AND from_unixtime(timestamp/1000) > now() - interval '10' day
GROUP BY "httprequest"."clientip", "allrulegroups"."ruleGroupId", "allrulegroups"."excludedrules"
ORDER BY count DESC
```

**Example – Group all counted managed rules by the number of times matched**
If you set rule group rule actions to Count in your web ACL configuration before October 27, 2022, AWS WAF saved your overrides in the web ACL JSON as `excludedRules`. Now, the JSON setting for overriding a rule to Count is in the `ruleActionOverrides` settings. For more information, see [Action overrides in rule groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-rule-group-override-options.html) in the *AWS WAF Developer Guide*. To extract managed rules in Count mode from the new log structure, query the `nonTerminatingMatchingRules` in the `ruleGroupList` section instead of the `excludedRules` field, as in the following example.

```
SELECT
 count(*) AS count,
 httpsourceid,
 httprequest.clientip,
 t.rulegroupid,
 t.nonTerminatingMatchingRules
FROM "waf_logs"
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(rulegrouplist) AS t(t)
WHERE action <> 'BLOCK' AND cardinality(t.nonTerminatingMatchingRules) > 0
GROUP BY t.nonTerminatingMatchingRules, action, httpsourceid, httprequest.clientip, t.rulegroupid
ORDER BY "count" DESC
Limit 50
```

**Example – Group all counted custom rules by number of times matched**
The following query groups all counted custom rules by the number of times matched.

```
SELECT
  count(*) AS count,
         httpsourceid,
         httprequest.clientip,
         t.ruleid,
         t.action
FROM "waf_logs"
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(nonterminatingmatchingrules) AS t(t)
WHERE action <> 'BLOCK' AND cardinality(nonTerminatingMatchingRules) > 0
GROUP BY t.ruleid, t.action, httpsourceid, httprequest.clientip
ORDER BY "count" DESC
Limit 50
```
