# View execution plans for SQL queries

You can use the Athena query editor to see graphical representations of how your query will
be run. When you enter a query in the editor and choose the **Explain**
option, Athena uses an [EXPLAIN](athena-explain-statement.md) SQL statement on your query to
create two corresponding graphs: a distributed execution plan and a logical execution plan.
You can use these graphs to analyze, troubleshoot, and improve the efficiency of your
queries.

###### To view execution plans for a query

1. Enter your query in the Athena query editor, and then choose
    **Explain**.

The **Distributed plan** tab shows you the execution plan for
    your query in a distributed environment. A distributed plan has processing fragments
    or _stages_. Each stage has a zero-based index
    number and is processed by one or more nodes. Data can be exchanged between
    nodes.

2. To navigate the graph, use the following options:

- To zoom in or out, scroll the mouse, or use the magnifying icons.

- To adjust the graph to fit the screen, choose the **Zoom to**
**fit** icon.

- To move the graph around, drag the mouse pointer.

3. To see details for a stage, choose the stage.

4. To see the stage details full width, choose the expand icon at the top right of
    the details pane.

5. To see more detail, expand one or more items in the operator tree. For information
    about distributed plan fragments, see [EXPLAIN statement output types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/athena-explain-statement-understanding.html#athena-explain-statement-understanding-explain-plan-types).

###### Important

Currently, some partition filters may not be visible in the nested operator
tree graph even though Athena does apply them to your query. To verify the effect
of such filters, run [EXPLAIN](athena-explain-statement.md#athena-explain-statement-syntax-athena-engine-version-2) or [EXPLAIN ANALYZE](athena-explain-statement.md#athena-explain-analyze-statement) on
your query and view the results.

6. Choose the **Logical plan** tab. The graph shows the logical plan
    for running your query. For information about operational terms, see [Understand Athena EXPLAIN statement results](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/athena-explain-statement-understanding.html).

7. To export a plan as an SVG or PNG image, or as JSON text, choose
    **Export**.
