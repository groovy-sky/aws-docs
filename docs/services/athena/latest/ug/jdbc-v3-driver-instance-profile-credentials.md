# Instance profile credentials
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-instance-profile-credentials"></a>

This authentication type is used on Amazon EC2 instances. An *instance profile* is a profile attached to an Amazon EC2 instance. Using an instance profile credentials provider delegates the management of AWS credentials to the Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service. This removes the need for developers to store credentials permanently on the Amazon EC2 instance or worry about rotating or managing temporary credentials.

## Credentials provider
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-instance-profile-credentials-provider"></a>
