# Monitor Apache Spark with CloudWatch metrics

Athena publishes calculation-related metrics to Amazon CloudWatch when the **[Publish CloudWatch metrics](notebooks-spark-getting-started.md#notebook-gs-metrics)** option for
your Spark-enabled workgroup is selected. You can create custom dashboards, set alarms and
triggers on metrics in the CloudWatch console.

Athena publishes the following metric to the CloudWatch console under the
`AmazonAthenaForApacheSpark` namespace:

- `DPUCount` – number of DPUs consumed during the session to
execute the calculations.

This metric has the following dimensions:

- `SessionId` – The ID of the session in which the calculations
are submitted.

- `WorkGroup` – Name of the workgroup.

###### To view metrics for Spark-enabled workgroups in the Amazon CloudWatch console

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**, **All**
**metrics**.

3. Select the **AmazonAthenaForApacheSpark** namespace.

###### To view metrics with the CLI

- Do one of the following:

- To list the metrics for Athena Spark-enabled workgroups, open a command
prompt, and use the following command:

```nohighlight

aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "AmazonAthenaForApacheSpark"
```

- To list all available metrics, use the following command:

```nohighlight

aws cloudwatch list-metrics
```

If you've enabled CloudWatch metrics in your Spark-enabled Athena workgroup, Athena sends
the following metric to CloudWatch per workgroup. The metric uses the
`AmazonAthenaForApacheSpark` namespace.

Metric nameDescriptionDPUCount Number of DPUs (data processing units) consumed during the
session to execute the calculations. A DPU is a relative measure of
processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16
GB of memory.

This metric has the following dimensions.

DimensionDescriptionSessionId

The ID of the session in which the calculations are
submitted.

WorkGroup

The name of the workgroup.

In the release version Apache Spark version 3.5, if you've enabled CloudWatch metrics in your Athena Spark workgroup, Athena sends the following metric to CloudWatch. The metric uses the `AmazonAthenaForApacheSpark` namespace.

NameDescriptionDPUConsumedThe number of DPUs actively consumed by queries in a RUNNING state at a given time in the workgroup.

This metric has the following dimensions.

DimensionDescriptionAccount

The AWS account ID.

WorkGroup

The name of the workgroup.
