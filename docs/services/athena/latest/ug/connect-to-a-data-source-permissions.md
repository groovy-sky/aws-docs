# Permissions to create and use a data source in Athena
<a name="connect-to-a-data-source-permissions"></a>

## AWS Glue Data Catalog federated connectors without Lambda permissions
<a name="connect-to-a-data-source-permissions-managed"></a>
+ **IAM principal permissions to invoke Athena API for connector management and querying**
  + **Amazon Athena access** – The AmazonAthenaFullAccess managed policy provides full access to Amazon Athena and scoped access to the dependencies needed to enable querying, writing results, and data management. For more information, see [AmazonAthenaFullAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonAthenaFullAccess.html) in the AWS Managed Policy Reference Guide.
  + **AWS Glue connection management** – Permissions to create and manage AWS Glue connection objects.

        "Statement": [
            {

                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
**Note**
The example policy uses `"Resource": "*"` for simplicity. For production environments, scope permissions to specific resources where possible.
  + **AWS Lake Formation access** – Permissions to create an AWS Glue Catalog and use fine-grained access control.

+ **Glue Data Catalog IAM role**
  +  This section covers the permissions required for Athena to provision the infrastructure and query your data source. Amazon Athena Federated Query requires the following permissions in the role passed to **Glue Data Catalog IAM Role**.
**Note**
When you connect to a data source in a VPC, Athena creates an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) in your account within the specified VPC. The IAM role requires EC2 permissions to create, describe, and delete this network interface.

                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
**Note**
The example policy uses `"Resource": "*"` for simplicity. For production environments, scope permissions to specific resources where possible. For example, scope Secrets Manager permissions to specific secret ARNs.
