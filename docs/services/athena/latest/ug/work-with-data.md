# Create databases and tables

Amazon Athena supports a subset of data definition language (DDL) statements and ANSI SQL
functions and operators to define and query external tables where data resides in Amazon Simple Storage Service.

When you create a database and table in Athena, you describe the schema and the location of
the data, making the data in the table ready for real-time querying.

To improve query performance and reduce costs, we recommend that you partition your data
and use open source columnar formats for storage in Amazon S3, such as [Apache parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) or [ORC](https://orc.apache.org/).
