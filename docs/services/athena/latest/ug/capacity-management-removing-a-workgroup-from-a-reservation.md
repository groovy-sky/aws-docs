<a name="capacity-management-removing-a-workgroup-from-a-reservation"></a>

If you no longer require dedicated capacity for a workgroup or want to move a workgroup to its own reservation, you can remove it at any time. Removing a workgroup from a reservation is a straightforward process. After you remove a workgroup from a reservation, queries from the removed workgroup return to using on-demand capacity and are billed based on terabytes (TB) scanned.

**To remove one or more workgroups from a reservation**

1. On the details page for the capacity reservation, select the workgroups that you want to remove.

1. Choose **Remove workgroups**. The **Remove workgroups?** prompt informs you that all currently active queries will finish before the workgroup is removed from the reservation..

1. Choose **Remove**. The details page for your capacity reservation show that the removed workgroups are no longer present.
