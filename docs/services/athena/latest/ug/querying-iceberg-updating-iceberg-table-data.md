# Update Iceberg table data

You can manage Iceberg table data directly on Athena by using `INSERT`,
`UPDATE`, and `DELETE` queries. Each data management
transaction produces a new snapshot, which can be queried using time travel. The
`UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements follow the Iceberg format v2
row-level [position\
delete](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec) specification and enforce snapshot isolation.

###### Note

Athena SQL does not currently support the copy-on-write approach. The
`UPDATE`, `MERGE INTO`, and `DELETE FROM`
operations always use the merge-on-read approach with positional deletes, regardless of
specified table properties. In case you have setup table properties such as
`write.update.mode`, `write.merge.mode`, and/or
`write.delete.mode` to use copy-on-write, your queries won't fail as
Athena will ignore them and keep using merge-on-read.

Use the following commands to perform data management operations on Iceberg
tables.
