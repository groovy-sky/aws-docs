# Use a form in the Athena console to add an AWS Glue table

The following procedure shows you how to use the Athena console to add a table using the
**Create Table From S3 bucket data** form.

###### To add a table and enter schema information using a form

01. Open the Athena console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

02. In the query editor, next to **Tables and views**, choose
     **Create**, and then choose **S3 bucket**
    **data.**

03. On the **Create Table From S3 bucket data** form, for
     **Table name**, enter a name for the table. For information
     about acceptable characters for database names, table names, and column names in
     Athena, see [Name databases, tables, and columns](tables-databases-columns-names.md).

04. For **Database configuration**, choose an existing database, or
     create a new one.

05. For **Location of Input Data Set**, specify the path in Amazon S3 to
     the folder that contains the dataset that you want to process. Do not include a file
     name in the path. Athena scans all files in the folder that you specify. If your data
     is already partitioned (for example,

     s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/logs/year=2004/month=12/day=11/), enter the base path
     only (for example, s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/logs/).

06. For **Data Format**, choose among the following options:

- For **Table type**, choose **Apache**
**Hive**, **Apache Iceberg**, or **Delta**
**Lake**. Athena uses the Apache Hive table type as the default.
For information about querying Apache Iceberg tables in Athena, see [Query Apache Iceberg tables](querying-iceberg.md). For
information about using Delta Lake tables in Athena, see [Query Linux Foundation Delta Lake tables](delta-lake-tables.md).

- For **File format**, choose the file or log format that
your data is in.

- For the **Text File with Custom Delimiters**
option, specify a **Field terminator** (that is, a
column delimiter). Optionally, you can specify a
**Collection terminator** that marks the end of
an array type or a **Collection terminator** that
marks the end of a map data type.

- **SerDe library** – A SerDe
(serializer-deserializer) library parses a particular data format so that
Athena can create a table for it. For most formats, a default SerDe library
is chosen for you. For the following formats, choose a library according to
your requirements:

- **Apache Web Logs** – Choose either the
**RegexSerDe** or
**GrokSerDe** library. For RegexSerDe, provide
a regular expression in the **Regex definition**
box. For GrokSerDe, provide a series of named regular expressions
for the `input.format` SerDe property. Named regular
expressions are easier to read and maintain than regular
expressions. For more information, see [Query Apache logs stored in Amazon S3](querying-apache-logs.md).

- **CSV** – Choose
**LazySimpleSerDe** if your comma-separated
data does not contain values enclosed in double quotes or if it uses
the `java.sql.Timestamp` format. Choose
**OpenCSVSerDe** if your data includes quotes
or uses the UNIX numeric format for `TIMESTAMP` (for
example, `1564610311`). For more information, see [Lazy Simple SerDe for CSV, TSV, and custom-delimited files](lazy-simple-serde.md)
and [Open CSV SerDe for processing CSV](csv-serde.md).

- **JSON** – Choose either the
**OpenX** or **Hive** JSON
SerDe library. Both formats expect each JSON document to be on a
single line of text and that fields not be separated by newline
characters. The OpenX SerDe offers some additional properties. For
more information about these properties, see [OpenX JSON SerDe](openx-json-serde.md).
For information about the Hive SerDe, see [Hive JSON SerDe](hive-json-serde.md).

For more information about using SerDe libraries in Athena, see [Choose a SerDe for your data](supported-serdes.md).

07. For **SerDe properties**, add, edit, or remove properties and
     values according to the SerDe library that you are using and your
     requirements.

- To add a SerDe property, choose **Add SerDe**
**property**.

- In the **Name** field, enter the name of the property.

- In the **Value** field, enter a value for the property.

- To remove a SerDe property, choose **Remove**.

08. For **Table properties**, choose or edit the table properties
     according to your requirements.

- For **Write compression**, choose a compression option.
The availability of the write compression option and of the compression
options available depends on the data format. For more information, see
[Use compression in Athena](compression-formats.md).

- For **Encryption**, select **Encrypted data**
**set** if the underlying data is encrypted in Amazon S3. This option
sets the `has_encrypted_data` table property to true in the
`CREATE TABLE` statement.

09. For **Column details**, enter the names and data types of the
     columns that you want to add to the table.

- To add more columns one at a time, choose **Add a**
**column**.

- To quickly add more columns, choose **Bulk add columns**.
In the text box, enter a comma separated list of columns in the format
`column_name` `data_type`, `column_name` `data_type`\[, ...\], and then choose
**Add**.

10. (Optional) For **Partition details**, add one or more column
     names and data types. Partitioning keeps related data together based on column
     values and can help reduce the amount of data scanned per query. For information
     about partitioning, see [Partition your data](partitions.md).

11. (Optional) For **Bucketing**, you can specify one or more columns
     that have rows that you want to group together, and then put those rows into
     multiple buckets. This allows you to query only the bucket that you want to read
     when the bucketed columns value is specified.

- For **Buckets**, select one or more columns that have a
large number of unique values (for example, a primary key) and that are
frequently used to filter the data in your queries.

- For **Number of buckets**, enter a number that permits
files to be of optimal size. For more information, see [Top 10\
Performance Tuning Tips for Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/top-10-performance-tuning-tips-for-amazon-athena) in the AWS Big Data
Blog.

- To specify your bucketed columns, the `CREATE TABLE` statement
will use the following syntax:

```nohighlight

CLUSTERED BY (bucketed_columns) INTO number_of_buckets BUCKETS
```

###### Note

The **Bucketing** option is not available for the
**Iceberg** table type.

12. The **Preview table query** box shows the `CREATE
                        TABLE` statement generated by the information that you entered into the
     form. The preview statement cannot be edited directly. To change the statement,
     modify the form fields above the preview, or [create the statement\
     directly](creating-tables-how-to.md#to-create-a-table-using-hive-ddl) in the query editor instead of using the form.

13. Choose **Create table** to run the generated statement in the
     query editor and create the table.
