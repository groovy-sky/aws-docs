You first need to create a database in Athena.

**To create an Athena database**

1. Open the Athena console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

1. If this is your first time to visit the Athena console in your current AWS Region, choose **Explore the query editor** to open the query editor. Otherwise, Athena opens in the query editor.

1. Choose **Edit Settings** to set up a query result location in Amazon S3.

   ```

1. Choose **Run** or press **Ctrl\+ENTER**.
