# Create tables based on encrypted datasets in Amazon S3

Athena can read and write to tables whose underlying datasets are SSE-S3, SSE-KMS,
or CSE-KMS encrypted. Depending on the encryption option used for the table data and
the type of queries ran, you will possibly have to specify some additional
table properties in order to read and write encrypted data.

## Reading SSE-S3/SSE-KMS encrypted tables

No additional table properties need to be specified on table creation in order to read
SSE-S3/SSE-KMS encrypted datasets. Amazon S3 handles decrypting the SSE objects automatically.

## Reading CSE-KMS encrypted tables

There are two different sets of table properties that can be specified in order for
Athena to read CSE-KMS encrypted datasets,

- Using the `encryption_option` and `kms_key` table properties
(Recommended)

- Using the `has_encrypted_data` table property

###### Important

If you use Amazon EMR along with EMRFS to upload CSE-KMS encrypted Parquet files, you must
disable multipart uploads by setting
`fs.s3n.multipart.uploads.enabled` to `false`. If you
don't do this, Athena is unable to determine the Parquet file length and a
**HIVE\_CANNOT\_OPEN\_SPLIT** error occurs. For
more information, see [Configure\
multipart upload for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-plan-upload-s3.html#Config_Multipart) in the
_Amazon EMR Management Guide_.

### Using encryption\_option and kms\_key table properties

In a [CREATE TABLE](create-table.md) statement, use a
`TBLPROPERTIES` clause that specifies `encryption_option='CSE_KMS'` and
`kms_key='aws_kms_key_arn'`, as in the following example.

```sql

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE 'my_encrypted_data' (
   `n_nationkey` int,
   `n_name` string,
   `n_regionkey` int,
   `n_comment` string)
ROW FORMAT SERDE
   'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.serde.ParquetHiveSerDe'
STORED AS INPUTFORMAT
   'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.MapredParquetInputFormat'
LOCATION
   's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/folder_with_my_encrypted_data/'
TBLPROPERTIES (
    'encryption_option' = 'CSE_KMS',
    'kms_key' = 'arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678901:key/my_kms_key')
```

When these properties are configured,

- Athena can read CSE-KMS encrypted objects created by the V1, V2, or V3 Amazon S3
encryption clients.

- Athena will use the AWS KMS key in `kms_key` to decrypt the CSE-KMS data.
If any objects were encrypted with a different AWS KMS key, the query will
fail.

- Athena can still read SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS encrypted objects, though mixing server-side
and client-side encrypted objects is not recommended.

### Using has\_encrypted\_data table property

In a [CREATE TABLE](create-table.md) statement, use a
`TBLPROPERTIES` clause that specifies
`has_encrypted_data='true'`, as in the following example.

```sql

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE 'my_encrypted_data' (
   `n_nationkey` int,
   `n_name` string,
   `n_regionkey` int,
   `n_comment` string)
ROW FORMAT SERDE
   'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.serde.ParquetHiveSerDe'
STORED AS INPUTFORMAT
   'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.MapredParquetInputFormat'
LOCATION
   's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/folder_with_my_encrypted_data/'
TBLPROPERTIES (
    'has_encrypted_data' = 'true')
```

When the has\_encrypted\_data table property is specified,

- Athena can only read CSE-KMS encrypted objects created by the V1 Amazon S3
encryption client.

- Athena will infer the AWS KMS key used to encrypt the CSE-KMS object from
the object metadata and then use that key to decrypt the object.

- Athena can still read SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS encrypted objects, though mixing
server-side and client-side encrypted objects is not recommended.

###### Note

When `encryption_option` and `kms_key` are specified
alongside `has_encrypted_data`, the `encryption_option`
and `kms_key` table properties take precedence, and
`has_encrypted_data` is ignored.

When you use the Athena console to [create a table using a\
form](data-sources-glue-manual-table.md) and specify the table location, select the
**Encrypted data set** option to add the
`has_encrypted_data='true'` property to the table.

![Select Encrypted data set in the add table form](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/add-table-form-encrypted-option.png)

In the Athena console list of tables, CSE-KMS encrypted tables with
`has_encrypted_data='true'` display a key-shaped icon.

## Writing SSE-S3/SSE-KMS/CSE-KMS encrypted data

By default, newly inserted data files will be encrypted using the encryption
configuration of the query results specified in the Athena workgroup. In order to
write table data with a different encryption configuration than the encryption configuration
of the query results, you will have to add some additional table properties.

In a [CREATE TABLE](create-table.md) statement, use a `TBLPROPERTIES`
clause that specifies `encryption_option='SSE_S3 | SSE_KMS | CSE_KMS'` and
`kms_key='aws_kms_key_arn'`, as in the following example.

```sql

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE 'my_encrypted_data' (
   `n_nationkey` int,
   `n_name` string,
   `n_regionkey` int,
   `n_comment` string)
ROW FORMAT SERDE
   'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.serde.ParquetHiveSerDe'
STORED AS INPUTFORMAT
   'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.MapredParquetInputFormat'
LOCATION
   's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/folder_with_my_encrypted_data/'
TBLPROPERTIES (
    'encryption_option' = 'SSE_KMS',
    'kms_key' = 'arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678901:key/my_kms_key')
```

All newly inserted data will be encrypted using the encryption configuration
specified by the table properties rather than using the encryption configuration
of the query results in the workgroup.

## Considerations and Limitations

When writing and reading encrypted datasets, consider the following points.

- The `has_encrypted_data`, `encryption_option`, and
`kms_key` table properties can only be used with Hive tables.

- When creating a table with CSE-KMS encrypted data, we recommend that you
ensure that all data is encrypted with the same AWS KMS key.

- When creating a table with CSE-KMS encrypted data, we recommend that you
ensure that all data is CSE-KMS encrypted and that there is not a mix of
non-CSE-KMS and CSE-KMS encrypted objects.
