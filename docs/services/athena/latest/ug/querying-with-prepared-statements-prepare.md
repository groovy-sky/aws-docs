# PREPARE

Prepares a statement to be run at a later time. Prepared statements are saved
in the current workgroup with the name that you specify. The statement can
include parameters in place of literals to be replaced when the query is run.
Parameters to be replaced by values are denoted by question marks.

## Syntax

```sql

PREPARE statement_name FROM statement
```

The following table describes these parameters.

ParameterDescription`statement_name`The name of the statement to be prepared. The name must
be unique within the workgroup.`statement`A `SELECT`, `CTAS`, or `INSERT
                                            INTO` query.
