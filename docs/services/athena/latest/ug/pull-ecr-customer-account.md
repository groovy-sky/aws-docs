# Pull ECR images to your AWS account
<a name="pull-ecr-customer-account"></a>

Athena federation connector Lambda functions use container images that are stored in Athena-managed Amazon ECR repositories. To perform security scans on these container images, you must first copy them to an Amazon ECR repository in your account. This section provides step-by-step instructions on how to copy an image to your repository and configure your Lambda function to use the image.

## Prerequisites
<a name="pull-ecr-customer-account-prereq"></a>
+ An Athena Federation Connector – The connector can be created through any source, provided it uses a container image.
**Note**
To verify image deployment, check the Image tab in your Athena Federation Connector Lambda
+ Docker installed and running
+ AWS CLI installed
+ Account credentials with appropriate pull permissions

## How to transfer an image
<a name="image-transfer-procedure"></a>

1. Locate the Image URI from your Athena Federation Connector Lambda
**Example**

   ```
   account_id_1.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/athena-federation-repository:2025.15.1
   ```

1. Generate a Docker authentication token for the Athena-managed account:

   ```
   aws ecr get-login-password --region {{regionID}} | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin {{athena-managed-registry}}
   ```

   Where:
   + {{regionID}} is your deployment region (e.g., us-east-1)
   + {{athena-managed-registry}} is the registry portion of the Image URI (e.g., account\_id\_1.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com)

1. Pull the image from the Athena managed account:

   ```
   docker pull {{athenaImageURI}}
   ```

1. Authenticate Docker to your registry:

   ```
   aws ecr get-login-password --region {{regionID}} | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin {{customer-registry}}
   ```

   Where {{customer-registry}} is your ECR registry (e.g., account\_id\_2.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com)

1. Tag the pulled image for your repository:

   ```
   docker tag {{athenaImageURI}} {{yourImageURI}}
   ```

1. Push the image to your repository:

   ```
   docker push {{yourImageURI}}
   ```

1. Update your Athena Federation Connector:

   1. Navigate to your Lambda function

   1. Select **Deploy New Image**

   1. Enter your new image URI

   The Athena federated connector image is now located in your account, which allows you to perform CVE scans on the image.
