# Query restored Amazon Glacier objects

You can use Athena to query restored objects from the Amazon Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly
Glacier) and Amazon Glacier Deep Archive [Amazon S3 storage\
classes](../../../s3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.md#sc-glacier). You must enable this capability on a per-table basis. If you do not
enable the feature on a table before you run a query, Athena skips all of the table's Amazon Glacier
Flexible Retrieval and Amazon Glacier Deep Archive objects during query execution.

## Considerations and Limitations

- Querying restored Amazon Glacier objects is supported only on Athena engine version 3.

- The feature is supported only for Apache Hive tables.

- You must restore your objects before you query your data; Athena does not
restore objects for you.

## Configure a table to use restored objects

To configure your Athena table to include restored objects in your queries, you must
set its `read_restored_glacier_objects` table property to `true`.
To do this, you can use the Athena query editor or the AWS Glue console. You can also use
the [AWS Glue CLI](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/glue/update-table.html), the [AWS Glue API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-api-catalog-tables.html#aws-glue-api-catalog-tables-UpdateTable), or the [AWS Glue SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/sdk-general-information-section.html).

### Use the Athena query editor

In Athena, you can use the [ALTER TABLE SET TBLPROPERTIES](alter-table-set-tblproperties.md) command to set the table
property, as in the following example.

```sql

ALTER TABLE table_name SET TBLPROPERTIES ('read_restored_glacier_objects' = 'true')
```

### Use the AWS Glue console

In the AWS Glue console, perform the following steps to add the
`read_restored_glacier_objects` table property.

###### To configure table properties in the AWS Glue console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Glue console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue).

2. Do one of the following:

- Choose **Go to the Data Catalog**.

- In the navigation pane, choose **Data Catalog**
**tables**.

3. On the **Tables** page, in the list of tables, choose the
    link for the table that you want to edit.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Edit**
**table**.

5. On the **Edit table** page, in the **Table**
**properties** section, add the following key-value pair.

- For **Key**, add
`read_restored_glacier_objects`.

- For **Value**, enter `true`.

6. Choose **Save**.

### Use the AWS CLI

In the AWS CLI, you can use the AWS Glue [update-table](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/glue/update-table.html) command and its `--table-input` argument to
redefine the table and in so doing add the
`read_restored_glacier_objects` property. In the
`--table-input` argument, use the `Parameters` structure
to specify the `read_restored_glacier_objects` property and the value of
`true`. Note that the argument for `--table-input` must
not have spaces and must use backslashes to escape the double quotes. In the
following example, replace `my_database` and
`my_table` with the name of your database and
table.

```shell

aws glue update-table \
   --database-name my_database \
   --table-input={\"Name\":\"my_table\",\"Parameters\":{\"read_restored_glacier_objects\":\"true\"}}
```

###### Important

The AWS Glue `update-table` command works in overwrite mode, which
means that it replaces the existing table definition with the new definition
specified by the `table-input` parameter. For this reason, be sure to
also specify all of the fields that you want to be in your table in the
`table-input` parameter when you add the
`read_restored_glacier_objects` property.
