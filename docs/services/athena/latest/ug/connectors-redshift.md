# Amazon Athena Redshift connector

The Amazon Athena Redshift connector enables Amazon Athena to access your Amazon Redshift and Amazon Redshift Serverless
databases, including Redshift Serverless views. You can connect to either service using the JDBC
connection string configuration settings described on this page.

This connector can be registered with Glue Data Catalog as a federated catalog.
It supports data access controls defined in Lake Formation at the catalog, database, table, column, row, and tag levels. This connector uses Glue Connections to centralize configuration properties in Glue.

## Prerequisites

- Deploy the connector to your AWS account using the Athena console or the AWS Serverless Application Repository. For more information, see [Create a data source connection](connect-to-a-data-source.md) or [Use the AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy a data source connector](connect-data-source-serverless-app-repo.md).

## Limitations

- Write DDL operations are not supported.

- In a multiplexer setup, the spill bucket and prefix are shared across all
database instances.

- Any relevant Lambda limits. For more information, see [Lambda quotas](../../../lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.md) in the _AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

- Because Redshift does not support external partitions, all data specified by a
query is retrieved every time.

- Like Redshift, Athena treats trailing spaces in Redshift `CHAR`
types as semantically insignificant for length and comparison purposes. Note
that this applies only to `CHAR` but not to `VARCHAR`
types. Athena ignores trailing spaces for the `CHAR` type, but treats them as
significant for the `VARCHAR` type.

## Terms

The following terms relate to the Redshift connector.

- Database instance – Any instance of a
database deployed on premises, on Amazon EC2, or on Amazon RDS.

- Handler – A Lambda handler that accesses
your database instance. A handler can be for metadata or for data
records.

- Metadata handler – A Lambda handler that
retrieves metadata from your database instance.

- Record handler – A Lambda handler that
retrieves data records from your database instance.

- Composite handler – A Lambda handler that
retrieves both metadata and data records from your database instance.

- Property or parameter – A database
property used by handlers to extract database information. You configure these
properties as Lambda environment variables.

- Connection String – A string of text
used to establish a connection to a database instance.

- Catalog – A non-AWS Glue catalog registered
with Athena that is a required prefix for the `connection_string`
property.

- Multiplexing handler – A Lambda handler
that can accept and use multiple database connections.

## Parameters

Use the parameters in this section to configure the Redshift connector.

We recommend that you configure a Redshift connector by using a Glue
connections object. To do this, set the `glue_connection`
environment variable of the Amazon Redshift connector Lambda to the name of the Glue
connection to use.

**Glue connections properties**

Use the following command to get the schema for a Glue connection object. This schema contains all the parameters that you can use to control your connection.

```

aws glue describe-connection-type --connection-type REDSHIFT
```

**Lambda environment properties**

glue\_connection – Specifies the name of the Glue connection associated with the federated connector.

###### Note

- All connectors that use Glue connections must use AWS Secrets Manager to store credentials.

- The Redshift connector created using Glue connections does not support the use of a multiplexing handler.

- The Redshift connector created using Glue connections only supports `ConnectionSchemaVersion` 2.

###### Note

Athena data source connectors created on December 3, 2024 and later use AWS Glue connections.

The parameter names and definitions listed below are for Athena data source connectors created without an associated Glue connection. Use the following parameters only when you [manually deploy](connect-data-source-serverless-app-repo.md) an earlier version of an Athena data source connector or when the
`glue_connection` environment property is not
specified.

**Lambda environment properties**

- spill\_bucket – Specifies the Amazon S3 bucket
for data that exceeds Lambda function limits.

- spill\_prefix – (Optional) Defaults to a
subfolder in the specified `spill_bucket` called
`athena-federation-spill`. We recommend that you
configure an Amazon S3 [storage\
lifecycle](../../../s3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.md) on this location to delete spills older than a
predetermined number of days or hours.

- spill\_put\_request\_headers – (Optional) A
JSON encoded map of request headers and values for the Amazon S3
`putObject` request that is used for spilling (for example,
`{"x-amz-server-side-encryption" : "AES256"}`). For other
possible headers, see [PutObject](../../../s3/latest/api/api-putobject.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

- kms\_key\_id – (Optional) By default, any
data that is spilled to Amazon S3 is encrypted using the AES-GCM authenticated
encryption mode and a randomly generated key. To have your Lambda function use
stronger encryption keys generated by KMS like
`a7e63k4b-8loc-40db-a2a1-4d0en2cd8331`, you can specify a KMS key
ID.

- disable\_spill\_encryption – (Optional)
When set to `True`, disables spill encryption. Defaults to
`False` so that data that is spilled to S3 is encrypted using
AES-GCM – either using a randomly generated key or KMS to generate keys.
Disabling spill encryption can improve performance, especially if your spill
location uses [server-side\
encryption](../../../s3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.md).

- disable\_glue – (Optional) If present and set to true, the connector does not attempt to retrieve supplemental metadata from AWS Glue.

- glue\_catalog – (Optional) Use this
option to specify a [cross-account AWS Glue\
catalog](data-sources-glue-cross-account.md). By default, the connector attempts to get metadata from its
own AWS Glue account.

#### Connection string

Use a JDBC connection string in the following format to connect to a database
instance.

```nohighlight

redshift://${jdbc_connection_string}
```

#### Using a multiplexing handler

You can use a multiplexer to connect to multiple database instances with a single
Lambda function. Requests are routed by catalog name. Use the following classes in
Lambda.

HandlerClassComposite handler`RedshiftMuxCompositeHandler`Metadata handler`RedshiftMuxMetadataHandler`Record handler`RedshiftMuxRecordHandler`

##### Multiplexing handler parameters

ParameterDescription`$catalog_connection_string`Required. A database instance connection string. Prefix the
environment variable with the name of the catalog used in Athena. For example,
if the catalog registered with Athena is
`myredshiftcatalog`, then the environment
variable name is
`myredshiftcatalog_connection_string`.`default`Required. The default connection string. This string is used
when the catalog is
`lambda:${` `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME` `}`.

The following example properties are for a Redshift MUX Lambda function
that supports two database instances: `redshift1` (the
default), and `redshift2`.

PropertyValue`default``redshift://jdbc:redshift://redshift1.host:5439/dev?user=sample2&password=sample2``redshift_catalog1_connection_string``redshift://jdbc:redshift://redshift1.host:3306/default?${Test/RDS/Redshift1}``redshift_catalog2_connection_string``redshift://jdbc:redshift://redshift2.host:3333/default?user=sample2&password=sample2`

##### Providing credentials

To provide a user name and password for your database in your JDBC connection
string, you can use connection string properties or AWS Secrets Manager.

- Connection String – A user name
and password can be specified as properties in the JDBC connection
string.

###### Important

As a security best practice, don't use hardcoded credentials in your
environment variables or connection strings. For information about moving
your hardcoded secrets to AWS Secrets Manager, see [Move hardcoded\
secrets to AWS Secrets Manager](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/hardcoded.md) in the
_AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.

- AWS Secrets Manager – To use the Athena
Federated Query feature with AWS Secrets Manager, the VPC connected to your Lambda
function should have [internet access](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/internet-access-lambda-function) or a [VPC\
endpoint](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoint-overview.md) to connect to Secrets Manager.

You can put the name of a secret in AWS Secrets Manager in your JDBC connection
string. The connector replaces the secret name with the
`username` and `password` values from
Secrets Manager.

For Amazon RDS database instances, this support is tightly integrated. If
you use Amazon RDS, we highly recommend using AWS Secrets Manager and credential
rotation. If your database does not use Amazon RDS, store the credentials as
JSON in the following format:

```nohighlight

{"username": "${username}", "password": "${password}"}
```

###### Example connection string with secret name

The following string has the secret name ${Test/RDS/
`Redshift1`}.

```nohighlight

redshift://jdbc:redshift://redshift1.host:3306/default?...&${Test/RDS/Redshift1}&...
```

The connector uses the secret name to retrieve secrets and provide the user name and password, as in the following example.

```nohighlight

redshift://jdbc:redshift://redshift1.host:3306/default?...&user=sample2&password=sample2&...
```

Currently, the Redshift connector recognizes the `user` and
`password` JDBC properties.

## Partitions and splits

Redshift does not support external partitions. For information about performance
related issues, see [Performance](#connectors-redshift-performance).

## Performance

The Athena Redshift connector performs predicate pushdown to decrease the data scanned by the query. `LIMIT` clauses, `ORDER BY` clauses, simple predicates, and complex expressions are pushed down to the connector to reduce the amount of data scanned and decrease query execution run time. However, selecting a subset of columns sometimes results in a longer query execution runtime.
Amazon Redshift is particularly susceptible to query execution slowdown when you run multiple
queries concurrently.

### LIMIT clauses

A `LIMIT N` statement reduces the data scanned by the query. With
`LIMIT N` pushdown, the connector returns only `N` rows to
Athena.

### Top N queries

A top `N` query specifies an ordering of the result set and a limit on
the number of rows returned. You can use this type of query to determine the top
`N` max values or top `N` min values for your datasets.
With top `N` pushdown, the connector returns only `N` ordered
rows to Athena.

### Predicates

A predicate is an expression in the `WHERE` clause of a SQL query that
evaluates to a Boolean value and filters rows based on multiple conditions. The
Athena Redshift connector can combine these expressions and push them directly to
Redshift for enhanced functionality and to reduce the amount of data scanned.

The following Athena Redshift connector operators support predicate
pushdown:

- Boolean: AND, OR, NOT

- Equality: EQUAL, NOT\_EQUAL, LESS\_THAN,
LESS\_THAN\_OR\_EQUAL, GREATER\_THAN, GREATER\_THAN\_OR\_EQUAL, IS\_DISTINCT\_FROM,
NULL\_IF, IS\_NULL

- Arithmetic: ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY,
DIVIDE, MODULUS, NEGATE

- Other: LIKE\_PATTERN, IN

### Combined pushdown example

For enhanced querying capabilities, combine the pushdown types, as in the following example:

```sql

SELECT *
FROM my_table
WHERE col_a > 10
    AND ((col_a + col_b) > (col_c % col_d))
    AND (col_e IN ('val1', 'val2', 'val3') OR col_f LIKE '%pattern%')
ORDER BY col_a DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

For an article on using predicate pushdown to improve performance in federated
queries, including Amazon Redshift, see [Improve federated queries with predicate pushdown in Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/improve-federated-queries-with-predicate-pushdown-in-amazon-athena) in the
_AWS Big Data Blog_.

## Passthrough queries

The Redshift connector supports [passthrough queries](federated-query-passthrough.md). Passthrough
queries use a table function to push your full query down to the data source for
execution.

To use passthrough queries with Redshift, you can use the following syntax:

```sql

SELECT * FROM TABLE(
        system.query(
            query => 'query string'
        ))
```

The following example query pushes down a query to a data source in Redshift. The query
selects all columns in the `customer` table, limiting the results to 10.

```sql

SELECT * FROM TABLE(
        system.query(
            query => 'SELECT * FROM customer LIMIT 10'
        ))
```
