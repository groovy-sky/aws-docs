# Understand service quotas for Athena for Spark
<a name="notebooks-spark-quotas"></a>

*Service quotas*, also known as *limits*, are the maximum number of service resources or operations that your AWS account can use. For more information about the service quotas for other AWS services that you can use with Amazon Athena for Spark, see [AWS service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

**Note**
The default values are the initial quotas set by AWS, which are separate from the actual applied quota value and maximum possible service quota. New AWS accounts might have initial lower quotas that can increase over time. Amazon Athena for Apache Spark monitors account usage within each AWS Region, and then automatically increases the quotas based on your usage. If your requirements exceed the stated limits, contact customer support.

The following table lists the service quotas for Amazon Athena for Apache Spark.

| Name | Default | Adjustable | Version | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Apache Spark DPU concurrency | 160 | No | PySpark Version 3 | The maximum number of data processing units (DPUs) that you can consume concurrently for Apache Spark calculations for a single account in the current AWS Region. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. |
| Apache Spark session DPU concurrency | 60 | No | PySpark Version 3 | The maximum number of DPUs you can consume concurrently for an Apache Spark calculation within a session. |
| On-Demand DPUs | 4 | No | Apache Spark Version 3.5 | The maximum number of data processing units (DPUs) that you can consume concurrently for Apache Spark interactive sessions in the current AWS Region. |
