# Manage notebook files

###### Note

The Athena notebook editor is supported in the Pyspark engine version 3. For using notebooks with Apache
Spark version 3.5, see [SageMaker Notebooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-unified-studio/latest/userguide/what-is-sagemaker-unified-studio.html).

Besides using the notebook explorer to [create](notebooks-spark-getting-started.md#notebooks-spark-getting-started-creating-your-own-notebook)
notebooks, you can also use it to open, rename, delete, export, or import notebooks, or view
the session history for a notebook.

###### To open a previously created notebook

    left.

2. In the Athena console navigation pane, choose **Notebook editor**
    or **Notebook explorer**.

3. Do one of the following:

- In **Notebook editor**, choose a notebook in the
**Recent notebooks** or **Saved**
**notebooks** list. The notebook opens in a new session.

in the list. The notebook opens in a new session.

###### To rename a notebook

1. [Terminate](notebooks-spark-getting-started.md#notebooks-spark-getting-started-terminating-a-session) any active sessions for the notebook that you want to rename.
