# Work with Athena views

Athena views can be easily created, updated, and managed in the Athena console.

## Create views

You can create a view in the Athena console by using a template or by running an
existing query.

###### To use a template to create a view

1. In the Athena console, next to **Tables and views**, choose
    **Create**, and then choose **Create**
**view**.

![Creating a view.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/create-view.png)

This action places an editable view template into the query editor.

2. Edit the view template according to your requirements. When you enter a name
    for the view in the statement, remember that view names cannot contain special
    characters other than underscore `(_)`. See [Name databases, tables, and columns](tables-databases-columns-names.md). Avoid using [Escape reserved keywords in queries](reserved-words.md) for naming views.

For more information about creating views, see [CREATE VIEW and CREATE PROTECTED MULTI DIALECT VIEW](create-view.md) and [Examples of Athena views](views-examples.md).

3. Choose **Run** to create the view. The view appears in the
    list of views in the Athena console.

###### To create a view from an existing query

1. Use the Athena query editor to run an existing query.

2. Under the query editor window, choose **Create**, and then
    choose **View from query**.

![Choose Create, View from query.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/create-view-from-query.png)

3. In the **Create View** dialog box, enter a name for the view,
    and then choose **Create**. View names cannot contain special
    characters other than underscore `(_)`. See [Name databases, tables, and columns](tables-databases-columns-names.md). Avoid using [Escape reserved keywords in queries](reserved-words.md) for naming
    views.

Athena adds the view to the list of views in the console and displays the
    `CREATE VIEW` statement for the view in the query editor.

###### Notes

- If you delete a table on which a table is based and then attempt to run the
view, Athena displays an error message.

- You can create a nested view, which is a view on top of an existing view.
Athena prevents you from running a recursive view that references itself.
