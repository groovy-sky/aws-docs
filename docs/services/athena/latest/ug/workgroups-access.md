# Configure access to workgroups and tags

A workgroup is a resource managed by Athena. Therefore, if your workgroup policy uses
actions that take `workgroup` as an input, you must specify the workgroup's
ARN as follows, where `workgroup-name` is the name
of your workgroup:

```nohighlight

"Resource": [arn:aws:athena:region:AWSAcctID:workgroup/workgroup-name]
```

For example, for a workgroup named `test_workgroup` in the
`us-west-2` region for Amazon Web Services account `123456789012`,
specify the workgroup as a resource using the following ARN:

```

"Resource":["arn:aws:athena:us-east-2:123456789012:workgroup/test_workgroup"]
```

To access trusted identity propagation (TIP) enabled workgroups, IAM Identity Center users must be
assigned to the `IdentityCenterApplicationArn` that is returned by the
response of the Athena [GetWorkGroup](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-getworkgroup.md) API
action.
