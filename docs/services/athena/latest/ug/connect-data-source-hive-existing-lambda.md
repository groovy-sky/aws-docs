# Configure Athena to use a deployed Hive metastore connector

After you have deployed a Lambda data source connector like
`AthenaHiveMetastoreFunction` to your account, you can configure Athena to use
it. To do so, you create a data source name that refers to your external Hive metastore to
use in your Athena queries.

###### To connect Athena to your Hive metastore using an existing Lambda function

01. Open the Athena console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

02. If the console navigation pane is not visible, choose the expansion menu
     on the left.

03. Choose **Data sources and catalogs**.

04. On the **Data sources and catalogs** page, choose **Create data**
    **source**.

05. On the **Choose a data source** page, for **Data**
    **sources**, choose **S3 - Apache Hive**
    **metastore**.

06. Choose **Next**.

07. In the **Data source details** section, for **Data source**
    **name**, enter the name that you want to use in your SQL statements when
     you query the data source from Athena (for example, `MyHiveMetastore`).
     The name can be up to 127 characters and must be unique within your account. It
     cannot be changed after you create it. Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, \_
     (underscore), @ (at sign) and - (hyphen). The names `awsdatacatalog`,
     `hive`, `jmx`, and `system` are reserved by
     Athena and cannot be used for data source names.

08. In the **Connection details** section, use the **Select**
    **or enter a Lambda function** box to choose the name of the function that
     you just created. The ARN of the Lambda function displays.

09. (Optional) For **Tags**, add key-value pairs to associate with
     this data source. For more information about tags, see [Tag Athena resources](tags.md).

10. Choose **Next**.

11. On the **Review and create** page, review the data source
     details, and then choose **Create data source**.

12. The **Data source details** section of the page for your data
     source shows information about your new connector.

    You can now use the **Data source name** that you specified to
     reference the Hive metastore in your SQL queries in Athena.

    In your SQL queries, use the following example syntax, replacing
     `ehms-catalog` with the data source name that you specified
     earlier.

    ```

    SELECT * FROM ehms-catalog.CustomerData.customers
    ```

13. To view, edit, or delete the data sources that you create, see [Manage your data sources](data-sources-managing.md).
