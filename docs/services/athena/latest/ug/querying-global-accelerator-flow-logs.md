# Query AWS Global Accelerator flow logs

You can use AWS Global Accelerator to create accelerators that direct network traffic to optimal
endpoints over the AWS global network. For more information about Global Accelerator, see [What is AWS Global Accelerator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html).

Global Accelerator flow logs enable you to capture information about the IP address traffic going to
and from network interfaces in your accelerators. Flow log data is published to Amazon S3, where
you can retrieve and view your data. For more information, see [Flow logs in\
AWS Global Accelerator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/monitoring-global-accelerator.flow-logs.html).

You can use Athena to query your Global Accelerator flow logs by creating a table that specifies their
location in Amazon S3.

###### To create the table for Global Accelerator flow logs

1. Copy and paste the following DDL statement into the Athena console. This query
    specifies _ROW FORMAT DELIMITED_ and omits specifying a [SerDe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/serde-reference.html), which
    means that the query uses the [LazySimpleSerDe](lazy-simple-serde.md). In this
    query, fields are terminated by a space.

```sql

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS aga_flow_logs (
     version string,
     account string,
     acceleratorid string,
     clientip string,
     clientport int,
     gip string,
     gipport int,
     endpointip string,
     endpointport int,
     protocol string,
     ipaddresstype string,
     numpackets bigint,
     numbytes int,
     starttime int,
     endtime int,
     action string,
     logstatus string,
     agasourceip string,
     agasourceport int,
     endpointregion string,
     agaregion string,
     direction string,
     vpc_id string,
     reject_reason string
)
PARTITIONED BY (dt string)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ' '
LOCATION 's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/prefix/AWSLogs/account_id/globalaccelerator/region/'
TBLPROPERTIES ("skip.header.line.count"="1");
```

2. Modify the `LOCATION` value to point to the Amazon S3 bucket that contains
    your log data.

```nohighlight

's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/prefix/AWSLogs/account_id/globalaccelerator/region_code/'
```

3. Run the query in the Athena console. After the query completes, Athena registers the
    `aga_flow_logs` table, making the data in it available for
    queries.

4. Create partitions to read the data, as in the following sample query. The query
    creates a single partition for a specified date. Replace the placeholders for date
    and location.

```sql

ALTER TABLE aga_flow_logs
ADD PARTITION (dt='YYYY-MM-dd')
LOCATION 's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/prefix/AWSLogs/account_id/globalaccelerator/region_code/YYYY/MM/dd';
```

## Example queries for AWS Global Accelerator flow logs

###### Example– List the requests that pass through a specific edge location

The following example query lists requests that passed through the LHR edge
location. Use the `LIMIT` operator to limit the number of logs to query
at one time.

```sql

SELECT
  clientip,
  agaregion,
  protocol,
  action
FROM
  aga_flow_logs
WHERE
  agaregion LIKE 'LHR%'
LIMIT
  100;
```

###### Example– List the endpoint IP addresses that receive the most HTTPS requests

To see which endpoint IP addresses are receiving the highest number of HTTPS
requests, use the following query. This query counts the number of packets received
on HTTPS port 443, groups them by destination IP address, and returns the top 10 IP
addresses.

```sql

SELECT
  SUM(numpackets) AS packetcount,
  endpointip
FROM
  aga_flow_logs
WHERE
  endpointport = 443
GROUP BY
  endpointip
ORDER BY
  packetcount DESC
LIMIT
  10;
```
