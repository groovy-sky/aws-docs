# Perform other DDL operations on Iceberg tables

In addition to the schema evolution operations described in [Evolve Iceberg table schema](querying-iceberg-evolving-table-schema.md), you can also perform the
following DDL operations on Apache Iceberg tables in Athena.

## Database level operations

When you use [DROP DATABASE](drop-database.md) with
the `CASCADE` option , any Iceberg table data is also removed. The
following DDL operations have no effect on Iceberg tables.

- [CREATE DATABASE](create-database.md)

- [ALTER DATABASE SET DBPROPERTIES](alter-database-set-dbproperties.md)

- [SHOW DATABASES](show-databases.md)

- [SHOW TABLES](show-tables.md)

- [SHOW VIEWS](show-views.md)

## Partition related operations

Because Iceberg tables use [hidden partitioning](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/partitioning), you do not have to work with physical partitions
directly. As a result, Iceberg tables in Athena do not support the following
partition-related DDL operations:

- [SHOW PARTITIONS](show-partitions.md)

- [ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION](alter-table-add-partition.md)

- [ALTER TABLE DROP PARTITION](alter-table-drop-partition.md)

- [ALTER TABLE RENAME PARTITION](alter-table-rename-partition.md)

If you would like to see Iceberg [partition evolution](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/evolution) in Athena, send feedback to [athena-feedback@amazon.com](mailto:athena-feedback@amazon.com).

## Unload Iceberg tables

Iceberg tables can be unloaded to files in a folder on Amazon S3. For information, see
[UNLOAD](unload.md).

## MSCK REPAIR

Because Iceberg tables keep track of table layout information, running [MSCK REPAIR TABLE](msck-repair-table.md) as one does with
Hive tables is not necessary and is not supported.
