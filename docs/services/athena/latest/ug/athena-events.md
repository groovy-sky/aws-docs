# Monitor Athena query events with EventBridge

You can use Amazon Athena with Amazon EventBridge to receive real-time notifications regarding the state
of your queries. When a query you have submitted transitions states, Athena publishes an
event to EventBridge containing information about that query state transition. You can write simple
rules for events that are of interest to you and take automated actions when an event
matches a rule. For example, you can create a rule that invokes an AWS Lambda function when a
query reaches a terminal state. Events are emitted on a best effort basis.

Before you create event rules for Athena, you should do the following:

- Familiarize yourself with events, rules, and targets in EventBridge. For more
information, see [What Is Amazon EventBridge?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.html) For
more information about how to set up rules, see [Getting started with\
Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-get-started.html).

- Create the target or targets to use in your event rules.

###### Note

Athena currently offers one type of event, Athena Query State Change, but may add other
event types and details. If you are programmatically deserializing event JSON data, make
sure that your application is prepared to handle unknown properties if additional
properties are added.

The following is the basic pattern for an Amazon Athena event.

```json

{
    "source":[
        "aws.athena"
    ],
    "detail-type":[
        "Athena Query State Change"
    ],
    "detail":{
        "currentState":[
            "SUCCEEDED"
        ]
    }
}
```

The following example shows an Athena Query State Change event with the
`currentState` value of `SUCCEEDED`.

```json

{
    "version":"0",
    "id":"abcdef00-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678",
    "detail-type":"Athena Query State Change",
    "source":"aws.athena",
    "account":"123456789012",
    "time":"2019-10-06T09:30:10Z",
    "region":"us-east-1",
    "resources":[

    ],
    "detail":{
        "versionId":"0",
        "currentState":"SUCCEEDED",
        "previousState":"RUNNING",
        "statementType":"DDL",
        "queryExecutionId":"01234567-0123-0123-0123-012345678901",
        "workgroupName":"primary",
        "sequenceNumber":"3"
    }
}
```

The following example shows an Athena Query State Change event with the
`currentState` value of `FAILED`. The
`athenaError` block appears only when `currentState` is
`FAILED`. For information about the values for
`errorCategory` and `errorType`, see [Athena error catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/error-reference.html).

```json

{
    "version":"0",
    "id":"abcdef00-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678",
    "detail-type":"Athena Query State Change",
    "source":"aws.athena",
    "account":"123456789012",
    "time":"2019-10-06T09:30:10Z",
    "region":"us-east-1",
    "resources":[
    ],
    "detail":{
        "athenaError": {
            "errorCategory": 2.0, //Value depends on nature of exception
            "errorType": 1306.0, //Type depends on nature of exception
            "errorMessage": "Amazon S3 bucket not found", //Message depends on nature of exception
            "retryable":false //Retryable value depends on nature of exception
        },
        "versionId":"0",
        "currentState": "FAILED",
        "previousState": "RUNNING",
        "statementType":"DML",
        "queryExecutionId":"01234567-0123-0123-0123-012345678901",
        "workgroupName":"primary",
        "sequenceNumber":"3"
    }
}

```

### Output properties

The JSON output includes the following properties.

PropertyDescription`athenaError`Appears only when `currentState` is
`FAILED`. Contains information about the error
that occurred, including the error category, error type, error
message, and whether the action that led to the error can be
retried. Values for each of these fields depend on the nature of
the error. For information about the values for
`errorCategory` and `errorType`, see
[Athena error catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/error-reference.html).`versionId`The version number for the detail object's schema.`currentState`The state that the query transitioned to at the time of the
event.`previousState`The state that the query transitioned from at the time of the
event.`statementType`The type of query statement that was run.`queryExecutionId`The unique identifier for the query that ran.`workgroupName`The name of the workgroup in which the query ran.`sequenceNumber`A monotonically increasing number that allows for
deduplication and ordering of incoming events that involve a
single query that ran. When duplicate events are published for
the same state transition, the `sequenceNumber` value
is the same. When a query experiences a state transition more
than once, such as queries that experience rare requeuing, you
can use `sequenceNumber` to order events with
identical `currentState` and
`previousState` values.

## Example

The following example publishes events to an Amazon SNS topic to which you have subscribed.
When Athena is queried, you receive an email. The example assumes that the Amazon SNS topic
exists and that you have subscribed to it.

###### To publish Athena events to an Amazon SNS topic

1. Create the target for your Amazon SNS topic. Give the EventBridge events Service Principal
    `events.amazonaws.com` permission to publish to your Amazon SNS topic,
    as in the following example.

```json

{
       "Effect":"Allow",
       "Principal":{
           "Service":"events.amazonaws.com"
       },
       "Action":"sns:Publish",
       "Resource":"arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111111111111:your-sns-topic"
}
```

2. Use the AWS CLI `events put-rule` command to create a rule for Athena
    events, as in the following example.

```nohighlight

aws events put-rule --name {ruleName} --event-pattern '{"source": ["aws.athena"]}'
```

3. Use the AWS CLI `events put-targets` command to attach the Amazon SNS
    topic target to the rule, as in the following example.

```nohighlight

aws events put-targets --rule {ruleName} --targets Id=1,Arn=arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111111111111:your-sns-topic
```

4. Query Athena and observe the target being invoked. You should receive
    corresponding emails from the Amazon SNS topic.

## Use AWS User Notifications with Amazon Athena

You can use [AWS User Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notifications/latest/userguide/what-is.html) to set up delivery channels to get notified about
Amazon Athena events. You receive a notification when an event matches a rule that you
specify. You can receive notifications for events through multiple channels, including
email, [Amazon Q Developer in chat applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chatbot/latest/adminguide/what-is.html) chat notifications, or [AWS Console Mobile Application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/consolemobileapp/latest/userguide/what-is-consolemobileapp.html)
push notifications. You can also see notifications in the [Console Notifications Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/notifications). User Notifications supports aggregation,
which can reduce the number of notifications you receive during specific events.

For more information, see the [_AWS User Notifications User_\
_Guide_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notifications/latest/userguide/what-is.html).
