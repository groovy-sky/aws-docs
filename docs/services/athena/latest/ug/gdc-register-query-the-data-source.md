# Query AWS Glue data catalogs in Athena

To query data catalogs from Athena, do one of the following.

- Register the catalog in Athena as a data source, then use the data source name
to query the catalog. In this usage, the following queries are
equivalent.

```

SELECT * FROM my_data_source.my_database.my_table
```

- If you are querying a catalog that has not been registered as an Athena data source, you can
supply the full path to the catalog in your `SELECT` queries, as in
the following example.

```

SELECT * FROM "my_catalog/my_subcatalog".my_database.my_table
```

- You can also do this through the AWS Management Console.

1. Open the Athena console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena)

2. In the query editor, for **Data source**, choose
    **AwsDataCatalog**.

3. For **Catalog**, choose the name of the catalog that you want
    to use.

4. For **Database**, choose the database that contains
    the table that you want to query.

5. Enter a query like `SELECT * FROM
                               my_table`, and then choose
    **Run**.
