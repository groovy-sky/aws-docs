# Manage reservations

You can view and manage your capacity reservations on the **Capacity**
**reservations** page. You can perform management tasks like adding or
reducing DPUs, modifying workgroup assignments, and tagging or cancelling
reservations.

###### To view and manage capacity reservations

1. Open the Athena console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

2. If the console navigation pane is not visible, choose the expansion menu on
    the left.

3. Choose **Administration**, **Capacity**
**reservations**.

4. On the capacity reservations page, you can perform the following tasks:

- To create a capacity reservation, choose **Create**
**capacity reservation**.

- Use the search box to filter reservations by name or number of
DPUs.

- Choose the status drop-down menu to filter by capacity reservation
status (for example, **Active** or
**Cancelled**). For information about reservation
status, see [Understand reservation status](#capacity-management-understanding-reservation-status).

- To view details for a capacity reservation, choose the link for the
reservation. The details page for the reservation includes options for
[editing capacity](capacity-management-editing-capacity-reservations.md), [adding workgroups](capacity-management-adding-workgroups-to-a-reservation.md), [removing workgroups](capacity-management-removing-a-workgroup-from-a-reservation.md), and for [cancelling](capacity-management-cancelling-a-capacity-reservation.md) the reservation.

- To edit a reservation (for example, by adding or removing DPUs),
select the button for the reservation, and then choose
**Edit**.

- To cancel a reservation, select the button for the reservation, and
then choose **Cancel**.

## Understand reservation status

The following table describes the possible status values for a capacity
reservation.

StatusDescription**Pending**Athena is processing your capacity request. Capacity is not ready
to run queries.**Active**Capacity is available to run queries.**Failed**Your request for capacity was not completed successfully. Note
that fulfillment of capacity requests is not guaranteed. Failed
reservations count towards your account DPU limits. To release the
usage, you must cancel the reservation.**Update pending**Athena is processing a change to the reservation. For example,
this status occurs after you edit the reservation to add or remove
DPUs.**Cancelling**Athena is processing a request to cancel the reservation. Queries
that are still running in the workgroups that were using the
reservation are allowed to finish, but other queries in the
workgroup will use on-demand (non-provisioned) capacity.**Cancelled**

The capacity reservation cancellation is complete. Cancelled
reservations remain in the console for 45 days. After 45 days,
Athena will delete the reservation. During the 45 days, you
cannot re-purpose or reuse the reservation, but you can refer to
its tags and view its details for historical reference.

Cancelled capacity is not guaranteed to be re-reservable at a
future date. Capacity cannot be transferred to another
reservation, AWS account or AWS Region.

## Understand Active DPUs and Target DPUs

In the list of capacity reservations in the Athena console, your reservation
displays two DPU values: **Active DPU** and **Target**
**DPU**.

- Active DPU – The number of DPUs that
are available in your reservation to run queries. For example, if you
request 100 DPUs, and your request is fulfilled, **Active**
**DPU** displays **100**.

- Target DPU – The number of DPUs that
your reservation is in the process of moving to. **Target**
**DPU** displays a value different than **Active**
**DPU** when a reservation is being created, or an increase or
decrease in the number of DPUs is pending.

For example, after you submit a request to create a reservation with 24 DPUs, the
reservation **Status** will be **Pending**,
**Active DPU** will be **0**, and the
**Target DPU** will be **24**.

If you have a reservation with 100 DPUs, and edit your reservation to request an
increase of 20 DPUs, the **Status** will be **Update**
**pending**, **Active DPU** will be
**100**, and **Target DPU** will be
**120**.

If you have a reservation with 100 DPUs, and edit your reservation to request a
decrease of 20 DPUs, the **Status** will be **Update**
**pending**, **Active DPU** will be
**100**, and **Target DPU** will be
**80**.

During these transitions, Athena is actively working to acquire or reduce the
number of DPUs based on your request. When **Active DPU** becomes
equal to **Target DPU**, the target number has been reached and no
changes are pending.

To retrieve these values programmatically, you can call the [GetCapacityReservation](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-getcapacityreservation.md) API action. The API refers to **Active**
**DPU** and **Target DPU** as `AllocatedDpus`
and `TargetDpus`.
