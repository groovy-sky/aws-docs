# Query Apache Hudi datasets

[_Apache Hudi_](https://hudi.incubator.apache.org/)
is an open-source data management framework that simplifies incremental data processing.
Record-level insert, update, upsert, and delete actions are processed much more granularly,
reducing overhead. `Upsert` refers to the ability to insert records into an
existing dataset if they do not already exist or to update them if they do.

Hudi handles data insertion and update events without creating many small files that can
cause performance issues for analytics. Apache Hudi automatically tracks changes and merges
files so that they remain optimally sized. This avoids the need to build custom solutions
that monitor and re-write many small files into fewer large files.

Hudi datasets are suitable for the following use cases:

- Complying with privacy regulations like [General\
data protection regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) (GDPR) and [California\
consumer privacy act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act) (CCPA) that enforce people's right to remove
personal information or change how their data is used.

- Working with streaming data from sensors and other Internet of Things (IoT)
devices that require specific data insertion and update events.

- Implementing a [change data capture (CDC) system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture).

A Hudi dataset can be one of the following types:

- **Copy on Write (CoW)** – Data is stored in a columnar
format (Parquet), and each update creates a new version of files during a
write.

- **Merge on Read (MoR)** – Data is stored using a
combination of columnar (Parquet) and row-based (Avro) formats. Updates are logged
to row-based `delta` files and are compacted as needed to create new
versions of the columnar files.

With CoW datasets, each time there is an update to a record, the file that contains the
record is rewritten with the updated values. With a MoR dataset, each time there is an
update, Hudi writes only the row for the changed record. MoR is better suited for write- or
change-heavy workloads with fewer reads. CoW is better suited for read-heavy workloads on
data that change less frequently.

Hudi provides three query types for accessing the data:

- Snapshot queries – Queries that see the
latest snapshot of the table as of a given commit or compaction action. For MoR
tables, snapshot queries expose the most recent state of the table by merging the
base and delta files of the latest file slice at the time of the query.

- Incremental queries – Queries only see new
data written to the table, since a given commit/compaction. This effectively
provides change streams to enable incremental data pipelines.

- Read optimized queries – For MoR tables,
queries see the latest data compacted. For CoW tables, queries see the latest data
committed.

The following table shows the possible Hudi query types for each table type.

For more information about the tradeoffs between table and query types, see [Table & Query Types](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/table_types) in the
Apache Hudi documentation.

## Hudi terminology change: Views are now queries

Starting in Apache Hudi release version 0.5.1, what were formerly called views are now
called queries. The following table summarizes the changes between the old and new
terms.
