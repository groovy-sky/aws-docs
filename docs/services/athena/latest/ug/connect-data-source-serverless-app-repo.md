# Use the AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy a data source connector

To deploy a data source connector, you can use the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo) instead of using a
AWS Glue connection.

###### Note

We recommend that you use the SAR only if you have a custom connector or require the
use of an older connector. Otherwise, the use of the Athena console is recommended.

You can use the AWS Serverless Application Repository to find the connector that you want to use, provide the parameters
that the connector requires, and then deploy the connector to your account. Then, after you
deploy the connector, you use the Athena console to make the data source available to
Athena.

## Deploying the connector to Your Account

###### To use the AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy a data source connector to your account

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the **Serverless App**
**Repository**.

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Available**
**applications**.

3. Select the option **Show apps that create custom IAM roles or**
**resource policies**.

4. In the search box, type the name of the connector. For a list of prebuilt
    Athena data connectors, see [Available data source connectors](connectors-available.md).

5. Choose the name of the connector. Choosing a connector opens the Lambda
    function's **Application details** page in the AWS Lambda
    console.

6. On the right side of the details page, for **Application**
**settings**, fill in the required information. The minimum required
    settings include the following. For information about the remaining configurable
    options for data connectors built by Athena, see the corresponding [Available connectors](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/wiki/Available-Connectors) topic on GitHub.

- **AthenaCatalogName** – A name for the Lambda
function in lower case that indicates the data source that it targets,
such as `cloudwatchlogs`.

- **SpillBucket** – Specify an Amazon S3 bucket in
your account to receive data from any large response payloads that
exceed Lambda function response size limits.

7. Select **I acknowledge that this app creates custom IAM roles and**
**resource policies**. For more information, choose the
    **Info** link.

8. At the bottom right of the **Application settings** section,
    choose **Deploy.** When the deployment is complete, the Lambda
    function appears in the **Resources** section in the Lambda
    console.

## Making the connector available in Athena

Now you are ready to use the Athena console to make the data source connector available
to Athena.

###### To make the data source connector available to Athena

01. Open the Athena console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

02. If the console navigation pane is not visible, choose the expansion menu
     on the left.

    ![Choose the expansion menu.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/nav-pane-expansion.png)

03. In the navigation pane, choose **Data sources and catalogs**.

04. On the **Data sources and catalogs** page, choose **Create data**
    **source**.

05. For **Choose a data source**, choose the data source for
     which you created a connector in the AWS Serverless Application Repository. This tutorial uses **Amazon**
    **CloudWatch Logs** as the federated data source.

06. Choose **Next**.

07. On the **Enter data source details** page, for **Data**
    **source name**, enter the name that you want to use in your SQL
     statements when you query the data source from Athena (for example,
     `CloudWatchLogs`). The name can be up to 127 characters and must
     be unique within your account. It cannot be changed after you create it. Valid
     characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, \_ (underscore), @ (at sign) and - (hyphen). The
     names `awsdatacatalog`, `hive`, `jmx`, and
     `system` are reserved by Athena and cannot be used for data source
     names.

08. In the **Connection details** section, use the
     **Select or enter a Lambda function** box to choose the name
     of the function that you just created. The ARN of the Lambda function
     displays.

09. (Optional) For **Tags**, add key-value pairs to associate
     with this data source. For more information about tags, see [Tag Athena resources](tags.md).

10. Choose **Next**.

11. On the **Review and create** page, review the data source
     details, and then choose **Create data source**.

12. The **Data source details** section of the page for your data
     source shows information about your new connector. You can now use the connector
     in your Athena queries.

    For information about using data connectors in queries, see [Run federated queries](running-federated-queries.md).
