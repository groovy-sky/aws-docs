# Step 3: Query data

Now that you have the `cloudfront_logs` table created in Athena based on the
data in Amazon S3, you can run SQL queries on the table and see the results in Athena. For
more information about using SQL in Athena, see [SQL reference for Athena](ddl-sql-reference.md).

###### To run a query

1. Choose the plus ( **+**) sign to open a new query tab and
    enter the following SQL statement in the query pane.

```sql

SELECT os, COUNT(*) count
FROM cloudfront_logs
WHERE date BETWEEN date '2014-07-05' AND date '2014-08-05'
GROUP BY os
```

2. Choose **Run**.

The results look like the following:

3. To save the results of the query to a `.csv` file, choose
    **Download results**.

**queries** tab.
