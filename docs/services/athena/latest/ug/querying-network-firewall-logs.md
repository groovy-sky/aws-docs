# Query AWS Network Firewall logs
<a name="querying-network-firewall-logs"></a>

AWS Network Firewall is a managed service that you can use to deploy essential network protections for your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud instances. AWS Network Firewall works together with AWS Firewall Manager so you can build policies based on AWS Network Firewall rules and then centrally apply those policies across your VPCs and accounts. For more information about AWS Network Firewall, see [AWS Network Firewall](https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/).

You can configure AWS Network Firewall logging for traffic that you forward to your firewall's stateful rules engine. Logging gives you detailed information about network traffic, including the time that the stateful engine received a packet, detailed information about the packet, and any stateful rule action taken against the packet. The logs are published to the log destination that you've configured, where you can retrieve and view them. For more information, see [Logging network traffic from AWS Network Firewall](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/firewall-logging.html) in the *AWS Network Firewall Developer Guide*.
