# Omit the catalog name in external Hive metastore queries

When you run DML and DDL queries on external Hive metastores, you can simplify your query
syntax by omitting the catalog name if that name is selected in the query editor. Certain
restrictions apply to this functionality.

## DML statements

###### To run queries with registered catalogs

1. You can put the data source name before the database using the syntax
    `[[data_source_name].database_name].table_name`,
    as in the following example.

```sql

select * from  "hms-catalog-1".hms_tpch.customer limit 10;
```

2. When the data source that you want to use is already selected in the query
    editor, you can omit the name from the query, as in the following
    example.

```sql

select * from hms_tpch.customer limit 10:
```

3. When you use multiple data sources in a query, you can omit only the default
    data source name, and must specify the full name for any non-default data
    sources.

For example, suppose `AwsDataCatalog` is selected as the default
    data source in the query editor. The `FROM` statement in the
    following query excerpt fully qualifies the first two data source names but
    omits the name for the third data source because it is in the AWS Glue data
    catalog.

```sql

...
FROM ehms01.hms_tpch.customer,
            "hms-catalog-1".hms_tpch.orders,
            hms_tpch.lineitem
...
```

## DDL statements

The following Athena DDL statements support catalog name prefixes. Catalog name
prefixes in other DDL statements cause syntax errors.

```sql

SHOW TABLES [IN [catalog_name.]database_name] ['regular_expression']

SHOW TBLPROPERTIES [[catalog_name.]database_name.]table_name [('property_name')]

SHOW COLUMNS IN [[catalog_name.]database_name.]table_name

SHOW PARTITIONS [[catalog_name.]database_name.]table_name

SHOW CREATE TABLE [[catalog_name.][database_name.]table_name

DESCRIBE [EXTENDED | FORMATTED] [[catalog_name.][database_name.]table_name [PARTITION partition_spec] [col_name ( [.field_name] | [.'$elem$'] | [.'$key$'] | [.'$value$'] )]
```

As with DML statements, you can omit the datasource and database prefixes from the
query when the data source and database are selected in the query editor.

In the following image, the `hms-catalog-1` data source and the
`hms_tpch` database are selected in the query editor. The `show
                create table customer` statement succeeds even though the
`hms-catalog-1` prefix and the `hms_tpch` database name are
omitted from the query itself.

## Specifying a default data source in a JDBC connection string

When you use the Athena JDBC Driver to connect Athena to an external Hive metastore, you can
use the `Catalog` parameter to specify the default data source name in your
connection string in a SQL editor like [SQL workbench](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/index.html).

###### Note

To download the latest Athena JDBC drivers, see [Using\
Athena with the JDBC driver](connect-with-jdbc.md).

The following connection string specifies the default data source
`hms-catalog-name`.

```

    jdbc:awsathena://AwsRegion=us-east-1;S3OutputLocation=s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/lambda/results/;Workgroup=AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality;Catalog=hms-catalog-name;

```

The following image shows a sample JDBC connection URL as configured in SQL
Workbench.
