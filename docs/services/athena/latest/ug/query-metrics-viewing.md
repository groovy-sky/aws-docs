# Monitor Athena query metrics with CloudWatch

Athena publishes query-related metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, when the [publish query metrics to CloudWatch](athena-cloudwatch-metrics-enable.md)
option is selected. You can create custom dashboards, set alarms and triggers on metrics in
CloudWatch, or use pre-populated dashboards directly from the Athena console.

When you enable query metrics for queries in workgroups, the metrics are displayed within
the **Metrics** tab in the **Workgroups** panel, for each
workgroup in the Athena console.

Athena publishes the following metrics to the CloudWatch console:

- `DPUAllocated` – The total number of DPUs (data processing units)
provisioned in a capacity reservation to run queries.

- `DPUConsumed` – The number of DPUs actively consumed by queries
in a `RUNNING` state at a given time in a reservation. Metric emitted
only when workgroup is associated with a capacity reservation and includes all
workgroups associated with a reservation.

- `DPUCount` – The maximum number of DPUs consumed by your query,
published exactly once as the query completes.

- `EngineExecutionTime` – The number of milliseconds that the query
took to run.

- `ProcessedBytes` – The number of bytes that Athena scanned per DML
query.

- `QueryPlanningTime` – The number of milliseconds that Athena took
to plan the query processing flow.

- `QueryQueueTime` – The number of milliseconds that the query was
in the query queue waiting for resources.

- `ServicePreProcessingTime` – The number of milliseconds that
Athena took to preprocess the query before submitting the query to the query
engine.

- `ServiceProcessingTime` – The number of milliseconds that Athena
took to process the query results after the query engine finished running the
query.

- `TotalExecutionTime` – The number of milliseconds that Athena took
to run a DDL or DML query.

For more complete descriptions, see the [List of CloudWatch metrics and dimensions for Athena](#athena-cloudwatch-metrics-table) later in this document.

These metrics have the following dimensions:

- `CapacityReservation` – The name of the capacity reservation used
to execute the query, if applicable.

- `QueryState` – `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, or
`CANCELED`

- `QueryType` – `DML`, `DDL`, or
`UTILITY`

- `WorkGroup` – name of the workgroup

Athena publishes the following metric to the CloudWatch console under the
`AmazonAthenaForApacheSpark` namespace:

- `DPUCount` – number of DPUs consumed during the session to
execute the calculations.

This metric has the following dimensions:

- `SessionId` – The ID of the session in which the calculations
are submitted.

- `WorkGroup` – Name of the workgroup.

For more information, see the [List of CloudWatch metrics and dimensions for Athena](#athena-cloudwatch-metrics-table) later in this topic. For information
about Athena usage metrics, see [Monitor Athena usage metrics with CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/monitoring-athena-usage-metrics.html).

You can view query metrics in the Athena console or in the CloudWatch console.

###### To view query metrics for a workgroup in the Athena console

1. Open the Athena console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

2. If the console navigation pane is not visible, choose the expansion menu
    on the left.

![Choose the expansion menu.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/nav-pane-expansion.png)

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Workgroups**.

4. Choose the workgroup that you want from the list, and then choose the
    **Metrics** tab.

The metrics dashboard displays.

###### Note

If you just recently enabled metrics for the workgroup and/or there
has been no recent query activity, the graphs on the dashboard may be
empty. Query activity is retrieved from CloudWatch depending on the interval
that you specify in the next step.

5. In the **Metrics** section, choose the metrics interval
    that Athena should use to fetch the query metrics from CloudWatch, or specify a
    custom interval.

![Specifying the metrics retrieval interval for a workgroup in the Athena console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/wg-custom-interval.png)

6. To refresh the displayed metrics, choose the refresh icon.

![Choose the refresh icon.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/wg-refresh-metrics.png)

7. Click the arrow next to the refresh icon to choose how frequently you want
    the metrics display to be updated.

![Choosing a refresh interval for the workgroup metrics display in the Athena console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/wg-choose-refresh-interval.png)

###### To view metrics in the Amazon CloudWatch console

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**, **All**
**metrics**.

3. Select the **AWS/Athena** namespace.

###### To view metrics with the AWS CLI

- Do one of the following:

- To list the metrics for Athena, open a command prompt, and use the
following command:

```nohighlight

aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "AWS/Athena"
```

- To list all available metrics, use the following command:

```nohighlight

aws cloudwatch list-metrics"
```

If you've enabled CloudWatch metrics in Athena, it sends the following metrics to CloudWatch per
workgroup. The following metrics use the `AWS/Athena` namespace.

Metric nameDescriptionDPUAllocated

The total number of DPUs (data processing units) provisioned in a
capacity reservation to run queries.

DPUConsumedThe number of DPUs actively consumed by queries in a
`RUNNING` state at a given time in a reservation. This
metric is emitted only when workgroup is associated with a capacity
reservation and includes all workgroups associated with a reservation.
If you move a workgroup from one reservation to another, the metric
includes data from the time when the workgroup belonged to the first
reservation. For more information about capacity reservations, see [Manage query processing capacity](capacity-management.md).DPUCountThe maximum number of DPUs consumed by your query, published exactly
once as the query completes. This metric is emitted only for workgroups
that are attached to a capacity reservation.EngineExecutionTime

The number of milliseconds that the query took to run.

ProcessedBytes

The number of bytes that Athena scanned per DML query. For queries
that were canceled (either by the users, or automatically, if they
reached the limit), this includes the amount of data scanned before
the cancellation time. This metric is not reported for DDL
queries.

QueryPlanningTimeThe number of milliseconds that Athena took to plan the query
processing flow. This includes the time spent retrieving table
partitions from the data source. Note that because the query engine
performs the query planning, query planning time is a subset of
EngineExecutionTime.QueryQueueTimeThe number of milliseconds that the query was in the query queue
waiting for resources. Note that if transient errors occur, the query
can be automatically added back to the queue.ServicePreProcessingTimeThe number of milliseconds that Athena took to preprocess the query
before submitting the query to the query engine.ServiceProcessingTimeThe number of milliseconds that Athena took to process the query
results after the query engine finished running the query.TotalExecutionTimeThe number of milliseconds that Athena took to run a DDL or DML query.
TotalExecutionTime includes QueryQueueTime, QueryPlanningTime,
EngineExecutionTime, and ServiceProcessingTime.

These metrics for Athena have the following dimensions.

DimensionDescriptionCapacityReservation

The name of the capacity reservation that was used to execute the
query, if applicable. When a capacity reservation is not used, this
dimension returns no data.

QueryState

The query state.

Valid statistics: SUCCEEDED, FAILED, or CANCELED.

QueryType

The query type.

Valid statistics: `DDL`, `DML`, or
`UTILITY`. The type of query statement that was run.
`DDL` indicates DDL (Data Definition Language) query
statements. `DML` indicates DML (Data Manipulation
Language) query statements, such as `CREATE TABLE AS
                                    SELECT`. `UTILITY` indicates query statements
other than DDL and DML, such as `SHOW CREATE TABLE`, or
`DESCRIBE TABLE`.

WorkGroup

The name of the workgroup.
