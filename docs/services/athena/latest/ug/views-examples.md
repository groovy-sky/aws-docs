# Examples of Athena views

To show the syntax of the view query, use [SHOW CREATE VIEW](show-create-view.md).

###### Example 1

Consider the following two tables: a table `employees` with two
columns, `id` and `name`, and a table `salaries`,
with two columns, `id` and `salary`.

In this example, we create a view named `name_salary` as a
`SELECT` query that obtains a list of IDs mapped to salaries from the
tables `employees` and `salaries`:

```sql

CREATE VIEW name_salary AS
SELECT
 employees.name,
 salaries.salary
FROM employees, salaries
WHERE employees.id = salaries.id
```

###### Example 2

In the following example, we create a view named `view1` that enables
you to hide more complex query syntax.

This view runs on top of two tables, `table1` and `table2`,
where each table is a different `SELECT` query. The view selects columns
from `table1` and joins the results with `table2`. The join is
based on column `a` that is present in both tables.

```sql

CREATE VIEW view1 AS
WITH
  table1 AS (
         SELECT a,
         MAX(b) AS the_max
         FROM x
         GROUP BY a
         ),
  table2 AS (
         SELECT a,
         AVG(d) AS the_avg
         FROM y
         GROUP BY a)
SELECT table1.a, table1.the_max, table2.the_avg
FROM table1
JOIN table2
ON table1.a = table2.a;

```
