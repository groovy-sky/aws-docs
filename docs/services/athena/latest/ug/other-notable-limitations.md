# Considerations and limitations for SQL queries in Amazon Athena

When running queries in Athena, keep in mind the following considerations and
limitations:

- Stored procedures – Stored procedures are
not supported.

- Maximum number of partitions – The maximum
number of partitions you can create with `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` (CTAS)
statements is 100. For information, see [CREATE TABLE\
AS](create-table-as.md). For a workaround, see [Use CTAS and INSERT INTO to work around the 100 partition limit](ctas-insert-into.md).

- Unsupported statements – Unsupported
statements include the following. For a complete list of unsupported DDL statements
in Athena, see [Unsupported DDL](unsupported-ddl.md).

- `CREATE TABLE LIKE` is not supported.

- `DESCRIBE INPUT` and `DESCRIBE OUTPUT` are not
supported.

- The `MERGE` statement is supported only for transactional table
formats. For more information, see [MERGE INTO](merge-into-statement.md).

- `UPDATE` statements are not supported.

- `DELETE FROM` is not supported.

- Trino and Presto connectors – Neither [Trino](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector.html) nor [Presto](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector.html) connectors
are supported. Use Amazon Athena Federated Query to connect data sources. For more information, see
[Use Amazon Athena Federated Query](federated-queries.md).

- Timeouts on tables with many partitions –
Athena may time out when querying a table that has many thousands of partitions. This
can happen when the table has many partitions that are not of type
`string`. When you use type `string`, Athena prunes
partitions at the metastore level. However, when you use other data types, Athena
prunes partitions on the server side. The more partitions you have, the longer this
process takes and the more likely your queries are to time out. To resolve this
issue, set your partition type to `string` so that Athena prunes
partitions at the metastore level. This reduces overhead and prevents queries from
timing out.

- Amazon Glacier support – For information about
querying restored Amazon Glacier objects, see [Query restored Amazon Glacier objects](querying-glacier.md).

- Files treated as hidden – Athena treats
source files that start with an underscore ( `_`) or a dot
( `.`) as hidden. To work around this limitation, rename the
files.

- Row or column size limitation – The size
of a single row or its columns cannot exceed 32 MB. This limit can be exceeded when,
for example, a row contains a single column of 35 MB. This is a hard limit of the
service and cannot be changed.

- Max line length in a text file – The size of
single line in a text file has an upper limit of 200 MB. Exceeding this limit can
produce the error message **`TextLineLengthLimitExceededException: Too many**
**bytes before newline`**. To work around this limitation, make sure that
you don't have a single line in a text file exceeding 200 MB.

- LIMIT clause maximum – The maximum number of
rows that can be specified for the `LIMIT` clause is

9223372036854775807\. When using `ORDER BY`, the maximum number of
supported rows for the LIMIT clause is 2147483647. Exceeding this limit results in
the error message **`NOT_SUPPORTED: ORDER BY LIMIT > 2147483647 is not**
**supported`**.

- information\_schema – Querying
`information_schema` is most performant if you have a small to
moderate amount of AWS Glue metadata. If you have a large amount of metadata, errors
can occur. For information about querying the `information_schema`
database for AWS Glue metadata, see [Query the AWS Glue Data Catalog](querying-glue-catalog.md).

- Array initializations – Due to a limitation in
Java, it is not possible to initialize an array in Athena that has more than 254
arguments.

- Hidden metadata columns – The Hive or
Iceberg hidden metadata columns `$bucket`,
`$file_modified_time`, `$file_size`, and
`$partition` are not supported for views. For information about using
the `$path` metadata column in Athena, see [Getting the file locations for source data in Amazon S3](select.md#select-path).

For information about maximum query string length, quotas for query timeouts, and quotas
for the active number of DML queries, see [Service Quotas](service-limits.md).
