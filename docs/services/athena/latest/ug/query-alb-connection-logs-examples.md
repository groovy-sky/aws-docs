# Example queries for ALB connection logs

The following query count occurrences where the value for
`tls_verify_status` was not `'Success'`, grouped by client IP
address:

```sql

SELECT DISTINCT client_ip, count() AS count FROM alb_connection_logs
WHERE tls_verify_status != 'Success'
GROUP BY client_ip
ORDER BY count() DESC;
```

The following query searches occurrences where the value for
`tls_handshake_latency` was over 2 seconds in the specified time
range:

```sql

SELECT * FROM alb_connection_logs
WHERE
  (
    parse_datetime(time, 'yyyy-MM-dd''T''HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS''Z')
    BETWEEN
    parse_datetime('2024-01-01-00:00:00', 'yyyy-MM-dd-HH:mm:ss')
    AND
    parse_datetime('2024-03-20-00:00:00', 'yyyy-MM-dd-HH:mm:ss')
  )
  AND
    (tls_handshake_latency >= 2.0);
```
