# Work with tags for workgroups

Using the Athena console, you can see which tags are in use by each workgroup in your
account. You can view tags by workgroup only. You can also use the Athena console to
apply, edit, or remove tags from one workgroup at a time.

You can search workgroups using the tags you created.

3. On the navigation menu, choose **Workgroups**, and then
    choose the workgroup that you want.

4. Do one of the following:

long, use the search box.

**Tags** section.

## Add and delete tags on an individual workgroup

You can manage tags for an individual workgroup directly from the
**Workgroups** tab.

###### Note

If you want users to add tags when they create a workgroup in the console or
pass in tags when they use the **CreateWorkGroup** action, make
sure that you give the users IAM permissions to the
**TagResource** and **CreateWorkGroup**
actions.
