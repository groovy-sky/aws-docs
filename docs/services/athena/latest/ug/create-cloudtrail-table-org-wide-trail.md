# Create a table for an organization wide trail using manual partitioning

To create a table for organization wide CloudTrail log files in Athena, follow the steps in
[Create a table for CloudTrail logs in Athena using manual partitioning](create-cloudtrail-table.md),
but make the modifications noted in the following procedure.

###### To create an Athena table for organization wide CloudTrail logs

1. In the `CREATE TABLE` statement, modify the `LOCATION`
    clause to include the organization ID, as in the following example:

```sql

LOCATION 's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/AWSLogs/organization_id/'
```

2. In the `PARTITIONED BY` clause, add an entry for the account ID as
    a string, as in the following example:

```sql

PARTITIONED BY (account string, region string, year string, month string, day string)
```

The following example shows the combined result:

```sql

...

PARTITIONED BY (account string, region string, year string, month string, day string)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.JsonSerDe'
STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'com.amazon.emr.cloudtrail.CloudTrailInputFormat'
OUTPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat'
LOCATION 's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/AWSLogs/organization_id/Account_ID/CloudTrail/'
```

3. In the `ALTER TABLE` statement `ADD PARTITION` clause,
    include the account ID, as in the following example:

```sql

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD
PARTITION (account='111122223333',
region='us-east-1',
year='2022',
month='08',
day='08')
```

4. In the `ALTER TABLE` statement `LOCATION` clause,
    include the organization ID, the account ID, and the partition that you want to
    add, as in the following example:

```sql

LOCATION 's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/AWSLogs/organization_id/Account_ID/CloudTrail/us-east-1/2022/08/08/'
```

The following example `ALTER TABLE` statement shows the combined
    result:

```sql

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD
PARTITION (account='111122223333',
region='us-east-1',
year='2022',
month='08',
day='08')
LOCATION 's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/AWSLogs/organization_id/111122223333/CloudTrail/us-east-1/2022/08/08/'
```

Note that, in a large organization, using this method to manually add and maintain a
partition for each organization account ID can be cumbersome. In such a scenario,
consider using CloudTrail Lake rather than Athena. CloudTrail Lake in such a scenario offers the
following advantages:

- Automatically aggregates logs across an entire organization

- Does not require setting up or maintaining partitions or an Athena table

- Queries are run directly in the CloudTrail console

- Uses a SQL-compatible query language

Lake](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-lake.html) in the _AWS CloudTrail User Guide_.
