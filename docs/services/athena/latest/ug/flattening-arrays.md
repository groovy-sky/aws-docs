# Flatten nested arrays

When working with nested arrays, you often need to expand nested array elements into a
single array, or expand the array into multiple rows.

## Use the flatten function

To flatten a nested array's elements into a single array of values, use the
`flatten` function. This query returns a row for each element in the
array.

```sql

SELECT flatten(ARRAY[ ARRAY[1,2], ARRAY[3,4] ]) AS items
```

This query returns:

```

+-----------+
| items     |
+-----------+
| [1,2,3,4] |
+-----------+
```

## Use CROSS JOIN and UNNEST

To flatten an array into multiple rows, use `CROSS JOIN` in conjunction
with the `UNNEST` operator, as in this example:

```sql

WITH dataset AS (
  SELECT
    'engineering' as department,
    ARRAY['Sharon', 'John', 'Bob', 'Sally'] as users
)
SELECT department, names FROM dataset
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(users) as t(names)
```

This query returns:

```

+----------------------+
| department  | names  |
+----------------------+
| engineering | Sharon |
+----------------------|
| engineering | John   |
+----------------------|
| engineering | Bob    |
+----------------------|
| engineering | Sally  |
+----------------------+
```

To flatten an array of key-value pairs, transpose selected keys into columns, as in
this example:

```sql

WITH
dataset AS (
  SELECT
    'engineering' as department,
     ARRAY[
      MAP(ARRAY['first', 'last', 'age'],ARRAY['Bob', 'Smith', '40']),
      MAP(ARRAY['first', 'last', 'age'],ARRAY['Jane', 'Doe', '30']),
      MAP(ARRAY['first', 'last', 'age'],ARRAY['Billy', 'Smith', '8'])
     ] AS people
  )
SELECT names['first'] AS
 first_name,
 names['last'] AS last_name,
 department FROM dataset
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(people) AS t(names)
```

This query returns:

```

+--------------------------------------+
| first_name | last_name | department  |
+--------------------------------------+
| Bob        | Smith     | engineering |
| Jane       | Doe       | engineering |
| Billy      | Smith     | engineering |
+--------------------------------------+
```

From a list of employees, select the employee with the highest combined scores.
`UNNEST` can be used in the `FROM` clause without a preceding
`CROSS JOIN` as it is the default join operator and therefore
implied.

```sql

WITH
dataset AS (
  SELECT ARRAY[
    CAST(ROW('Sally', 'engineering', ARRAY[1,2,3,4]) AS ROW(name VARCHAR, department VARCHAR, scores ARRAY(INTEGER))),
    CAST(ROW('John', 'finance', ARRAY[7,8,9]) AS ROW(name VARCHAR, department VARCHAR, scores ARRAY(INTEGER))),
    CAST(ROW('Amy', 'devops', ARRAY[12,13,14,15]) AS ROW(name VARCHAR, department VARCHAR, scores ARRAY(INTEGER)))
  ] AS users
),
users AS (
 SELECT person, score
 FROM
   dataset,
   UNNEST(dataset.users) AS t(person),
   UNNEST(person.scores) AS t(score)
)
SELECT person.name, person.department, SUM(score) AS total_score FROM users
GROUP BY (person.name, person.department)
ORDER BY (total_score) DESC
LIMIT 1
```

This query returns:

```

+---------------------------------+
| name | department | total_score |
+---------------------------------+
| Amy  | devops     | 54          |
+---------------------------------+
```

From a list of employees, select the employee with the highest individual
score.

```sql

WITH
dataset AS (
 SELECT ARRAY[
   CAST(ROW('Sally', 'engineering', ARRAY[1,2,3,4]) AS ROW(name VARCHAR, department VARCHAR, scores ARRAY(INTEGER))),
   CAST(ROW('John', 'finance', ARRAY[7,8,9]) AS ROW(name VARCHAR, department VARCHAR, scores ARRAY(INTEGER))),
   CAST(ROW('Amy', 'devops', ARRAY[12,13,14,15]) AS ROW(name VARCHAR, department VARCHAR, scores ARRAY(INTEGER)))
 ] AS users
),
users AS (
 SELECT person, score
 FROM
   dataset,
   UNNEST(dataset.users) AS t(person),
   UNNEST(person.scores) AS t(score)
)
SELECT person.name, score FROM users
ORDER BY (score) DESC
LIMIT 1
```

This query returns:

```

+--------------+
| name | score |
+--------------+
| Amy  | 15    |
+--------------+
```

### Considerations for CROSS JOIN and UNNEST

If `UNNEST` is used on one or more arrays in the query, and one of the
arrays is `NULL`, the query returns no rows. If `UNNEST` is
used on an array that is an empty string, the empty string is returned.

For example, in the following query, because the second array is null, the query
returns no rows.

```sql

SELECT
    col1,
    col2
FROM UNNEST (ARRAY ['apples','oranges','lemons']) AS t(col1)
CROSS JOIN UNNEST (ARRAY []) AS t(col2)
```

In this next example, the second array is modified to contain an empty string. For
each row, the query returns the value in `col1` and an empty string for
the value in `col2`. The empty string in the second array is required in
order for the values in the first array to be returned.

```sql

SELECT
    col1,
    col2
FROM UNNEST (ARRAY ['apples','oranges','lemons']) AS t(col1)
CROSS JOIN UNNEST (ARRAY ['']) AS t(col2)
```
