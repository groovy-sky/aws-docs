# Query Amazon VPC flow logs

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud flow logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network
interfaces in a VPC. Use the logs to investigate network traffic patterns and identify
threats and risks across your VPC network.

To query your Amazon VPC flow logs, you have two options:

- Amazon VPC Console – Use the Athena integration
feature in the Amazon VPC Console to generate an CloudFormation template that creates an Athena
database, workgroup, and flow logs table with partitioning for you. The template
also creates a set of [predefined\
flow log queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs-athena.html#predefined-queries) that you can use to obtain insights about the traffic
flowing through your VPC.

For information about this approach, see [Query flow logs using\
Amazon Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs-athena.html) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- Amazon Athena console – Create your tables and
queries directly in the Athena console. For more information, continue reading this
page.

Before you begin querying the logs in Athena, [enable VPC flow\
logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs.html), and configure them to be saved to your Amazon S3 bucket. After you create the
logs, let them run for a few minutes to collect some data. The logs are created in a GZIP
compression format that Athena lets you query directly.

When you create a VPC flow log, you can use a custom format when you want to specify the
fields to return in the flow log and the order in which the fields appear. For more
information about flow log records, see [Flow log records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html#flow-log-records) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.

## Considerations and limitations

When you create tables in Athena for Amazon VPC flow logs, remember the following
points:

- By default, in Athena, Parquet will access columns by name. For more
information, see [Handle schema updates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/handling-schema-updates-chapter.html).

- Use the names in the flow log records for the column names in Athena. The names
of the columns in the Athena schema should exactly match the field names in the
Amazon VPC flow logs, with the following differences:

- Replace the hyphens in the Amazon VPC log field names with underscores in
the Athena column names. For information about acceptable characters for
database names, table names, and column names in Athena, see [Name databases, tables, and columns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/tables-databases-columns-names.html).

- Escape the flow log record names that are [reserved\
keywords](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/reserved-words.html) in Athena by enclosing them with backticks.

- VPC flow logs are AWS account specific. When you publish your log files to
Amazon S3, the path that Amazon VPC creates in Amazon S3 includes the ID of the AWS account
that was used to create the flow log. For more information, see [Publish\
flow logs to Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs-s3.html) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.
