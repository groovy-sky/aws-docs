# DROP DATABASE

Removes the named database from the catalog. If the database contains tables, you must
either drop the tables before running `DROP DATABASE` or use the
`CASCADE` clause. The use of `DATABASE` and `SCHEMA`
are interchangeable. They mean the same thing.

## Synopsis

```sql

DROP {DATABASE | SCHEMA} [IF EXISTS] database_name [RESTRICT | CASCADE]
```

## Parameters

**\[IF EXISTS\]**

Causes the error to be suppressed if `database_name` doesn't
exist.

**\[RESTRICT\|CASCADE\]**

Determines how tables within `database_name` are regarded
during the `DROP` operation. If you specify
`RESTRICT`, the database is not dropped if it contains tables.
This is the default behavior. Specifying `CASCADE` causes the
database and all its tables to be dropped.

## Examples

```sql

DROP DATABASE clickstreams;
```

```sql

DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS clickstreams CASCADE;
```

###### Note

When you try to drop a database whose name has special characters (for example,
`my-database`), you may receive an error message. To resolve this issue,
try enclosing the database name in back tick (\`) characters. For information about
naming databases in Athena, see [Name databases, tables, and columns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/tables-databases-columns-names.html).
