# Connect Athena to an Apache Hive metastore

To connect Athena to an Apache Hive metastore, you must create and configure a Lambda
function. For a basic implementation, you can perform all required steps starting from
the Athena management console.

###### Note

The following procedure requires that you have permission to create a custom IAM
role for the Lambda function. If you do not have permission to create a custom role,
you can use the Athena [reference implementation](connect-to-data-source-hive.md#connect-to-a-data-source-hive-features-reference-implementation) to create a Lambda function separately, and then
use the AWS Lambda console to choose an existing IAM role for the function. For
more information, see [Connect Athena to a Hive metastore using an existing IAM execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-data-source-hive-existing-iam-role.html).

###### To connect Athena to a Hive metastore

01. Open the Athena console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

02. If the console navigation pane is not visible, choose the expansion menu
     on the left.

    ![Choose the expansion menu.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/nav-pane-expansion.png)

03. Choose **Data sources and catalogs**.

04. On the upper right of the console, choose **Create data**
    **source**.

05. On the **Choose a data source** page, for **Data**
    **sources**, choose **S3 - Apache Hive**
    **metastore**.

06. Choose **Next**.

07. In the **Data source details** section, for **Data**
    **source name**, enter the name that you want to use in your SQL
     statements when you query the data source from Athena. The name can be up to 127
     characters and must be unique within your account. It cannot be changed after
     you create it. Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, \_ (underscore), @ (at sign)
     and - (hyphen). The names `awsdatacatalog`, `hive`,
     `jmx`, and `system` are reserved by Athena and cannot
     be used for data source names.

08. For **Lambda function**, choose **Create Lambda**
    **function**, and then choose **Create a new Lambda function**
    **in AWS Lambda**

    The **AthenaHiveMetastoreFunction** page opens in the
     AWS Lambda console. The page includes detailed information about the
     connector.

    ![The AthenaHiveMetastoreFunction page in the AWS Lambda console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/connect-to-data-source-hive-4.png)

09. Under **Application settings**, enter the parameters for your
     Lambda function.

- **LambdaFuncName** – Provide a name for the
function. For example, **myHiveMetastore**.

- **SpillLocation** – Specify an Amazon S3 location
in this account to hold spillover metadata if the Lambda function response
size exceeds 4 MB.

- **HMSUris** – Enter the URI of your Hive
metastore host that uses the Thrift protocol at port 9083. Use the
syntax `thrift://<host_name>:9083`.

- **LambdaMemory** – Specify a value from 128 MB
to 3008 MB. The Lambda function is allocated CPU cycles proportional to
the amount of memory that you configure. The default is 1024.

- **LambdaTimeout** – Specify the maximum
permissible Lambda invocation run time in seconds from 1 to 900 (900
seconds is 15 minutes). The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).

- **VPCSecurityGroupIds** – Enter a comma-separated
list of VPC security group IDs for the Hive metastore.

- **VPCSubnetIds** – Enter a comma-separated list of
VPC subnet IDs for the Hive metastore.

10. Select **I acknowledge that this app creates custom IAM**
    **roles**, and then choose **Deploy**.

    ![Deploying the Lambda function app from the AWS Lambda console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/connect-to-data-source-hive-4a.png)

    When the deployment completes, your function appears in your list of Lambda
     applications. Now that the Hive metastore function has been deployed to your
     account, you can configure Athena to use it.

11. Return to the **Enter data source details** page of the Athena
     console.

12. In the **Lambda function** section, choose the refresh icon
     next to the Lambda function search box. Refreshing the list of available
     functions causes your newly created function to appear in the list.

13. Choose the name of the function that you just created in the Lambda console.
     The ARN of the Lambda function displays.

14. (Optional) For **Tags**, add key-value pairs to associate
     with this data source. For more information about tags, see [Tag Athena resources](tags.md).

15. Choose **Next**.

16. On the **Review and create** page, review the data source
     details, and then choose **Create data source**.

17. The **Data source details** section of the page for your data
     source shows information about your new connector.

    You can now use the **Data source name** that you specified
     to reference the Hive metastore in your SQL queries in Athena. In your SQL
     queries, use the following example syntax, replacing `hms-catalog-1`
     with the catalog name that you specified earlier.

    ```

    SELECT * FROM hms-catalog-1.CustomerData.customers
    ```

18. For information about viewing, editing, or deleting the data sources that you
     create, see [Manage your data sources](data-sources-managing.md).
