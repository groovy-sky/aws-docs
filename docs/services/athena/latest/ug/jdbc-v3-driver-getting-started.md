## Installation Instructions
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-installation-instructions"></a>

You can use the JDBC 3.x driver in custom application or from a third-party SQL client.

### In a custom application
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-installation-in-a-custom-application"></a>

Download the `.zip` file that contains the driver and its dependencies. Add the driver `.jar` file and every other `.jar` file in the `runtime-dependencies` directory to your custom application's Java classpath. Only omit a `.jar` file if your application already provides a compatible version of that dependency. The `AthenaStreamingJavaClient-2.0.jar` file provides the `software.amazon.awssdk.services.athenastreaming.AthenaStreamingAsyncClient` class. Include this file unless your application already provides that class.

### In a third-party SQL client
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-installation-in-a-third-party-sql-client"></a>

Download the driver uber jar file and add it to the third-party SQL client following the instructions for that client.

## Running the driver
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-running-the-driver"></a>

To run the driver, you can use a custom application or a third-party SQL client.

### In a custom application
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-running-in-a-custom-application"></a>

Use the JDBC interface to interact with the JDBC driver from a program. The following code shows a sample custom Java application.

```
public static void main(String args[]) throws SQLException {
    Properties connectionParameters = new Properties();
    connectionParameters.setProperty("Workgroup", "primary");
    connectionParameters.setProperty("Region", "us-east-2");
    connectionParameters.setProperty("Catalog", "AwsDataCatalog");
    connectionParameters.setProperty("Database","sampledatabase");
    connectionParameters.setProperty("OutputLocation","s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket");
    connectionParameters.setProperty("CredentialsProvider","DefaultChain");
    String url = "jdbc:athena://";
    AthenaDriver driver = new AthenaDriver();
    Connection connection = driver.connect(url, connectionParameters);
    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
    String query = "SELECT * from sample_table LIMIT 10";
    ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);
    printResults(resultSet); // A custom-defined method for iterating over a
                             // result set and printing its contents
}
```

### In a third-party SQL client
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-running-in-a-third-party-sql-client"></a>

Follow the documentation for the SQL client that you are using. Typically, you use the SQL client's graphical user interface to enter and submit the query, and the query results are displayed in the same interface.

## Configuring the driver
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-configuring-the-driver"></a>

You can use connection parameters to configure the Amazon Athena JDBC driver. For supported connection parameters, see [Amazon Athena JDBC 3.x connection parameters](jdbc-v3-driver-connection-parameters.md).

### In a custom application
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-configuring-in-a-custom-application"></a>

To set the connection parameters for the JDBC driver in a custom application, do one of the following:
+ Add the parameter names and their values to a `Properties` object. When you call `Connection#connect`, pass that object along with the URL. For an example, see the sample Java application in [Running the driver](#jdbc-v3-driver-running-the-driver).
+ In the connection string (the URL), use the following format to add the parameter names and their values directly after the protocol prefix.

  ```
  {{<parameterName>}}={{<parameterValue>}};
  ```

  Use a semi-colon at the end of each parameter name/parameter value pair, and leave no white space after the semicolon, as in the following example.

  ```
  String url = "jdbc:athena://WorkGroup=primary;Region=us-east-1;...;";AthenaDriver driver = new AthenaDriver();Connection connection = driver.connect(url, null);
  ```
**Note**
If a parameter is specified both in the connection string and in the `Properties` object, the value in the connection string takes precedence. Specifying the same parameter in both places is not recommended.
+ Add the parameter values as arguments to the methods of `AthenaDataSource`, as in the following example.

  ```
  AthenaDataSource dataSource = new AthenaDataSource();
      dataSource.setWorkGroup("primary");
      dataSource.setRegion("us-east-2");
      ...
      Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection();
      ...
  ```

### In a third-party SQL client
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-configuring-in-a-third-party-sql-client"></a>

Follow the instructions of the SQL client that you are using. Typically, the client provides a graphical user interface to input the parameter names and their values.

## Upgrading from the Athena JDBC v2 driver
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-upgrading-from-the-athena-jdbc-v2-driver-to-v3"></a>

Most of the JDBC version 3 connection parameters are backwards-compatible with the version 2 (Simba) JDBC driver. This means that a version 2 connection string can be reused with version 3 of the driver. However, some connection parameters have changed. These changes are described here. When you upgrade to the version 3 JDBC driver, update your existing configuration if necessary.

### Driver class
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-upgrading-driver-class"></a>

Some BI tools ask you to provide the driver class from the JDBC driver `.jar` file. Most tools find this class automatically. The fully qualified name of the class in the version 3 driver is `com.amazon.athena.jdbc.AthenaDriver`. In the version 2 driver, the class was `com.simba.athena.jdbc.Driver`.

### Connection string
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-upgrading-connection-string"></a>

The version 3 driver uses `jdbc:athena://` for the protocol at the beginning of the JDBC connection string URL. The version 3 driver also supports the version 2 protocol `jdbc:awsathena://`, but the use of the version 2 protocol is deprecated. To avoid undefined behaviors, version 3 does not accept connection strings that start with `jdbc:awsathena://` if version 2 (or any other driver that accepts connection strings that start with `jdbc:awsathena://`) has been registered with the [DriverManager](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/DriverManager.html) class.

### String column metadata
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-upgrading-string-column-metadata"></a>

With the JDBC 3.x driver, you can no longer use the JDBC 2.x `StringColumnLength` connection parameter. Instead, you can access the precision that Athena supplies through standard JDBC metadata methods, including `ResultSetMetaData.getPrecision` and `ResultSetMetaData.getColumnDisplaySize`. Because the Athena `string` type is unbounded, its reported precision can be `2147483647`.

If your application allocates fixed-size buffers from JDBC metadata, configure it to use variable-size buffers. If your application requires bounded column metadata, cast the column to `varchar({{n}})` in the query or expose the cast through a view. Choose a value for {{n}} that preserves all expected data because casting to a smaller size can truncate values.

### Credentials providers
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-upgrading-credentials-providers"></a>

The version 2 driver uses fully qualified names to identify different credentials providers (for example, `com.simba.athena.amazonaws.auth.DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain`. The version 3 driver uses shorter names (for example, `DefaultChain`). The new names are described in the corresponding sections for each credentials provider.

Custom credentials providers written for the version 2 driver need to be modified for the version 3 driver to implement the [AwsCredentialsProvider](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/auth/credentials/AwsCredentialsProvider.html) interface from the new AWS SDK for Java instead of the [AWSCredentialsProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/AWSCredentialsProvider.html) interface from the previous AWS SDK for Java.

The `PropertiesFileCredentialsProvider` is not supported in the JDBC 3.x driver. The provider was used in the JDBC 2.x driver but belongs to the previous version of the AWS SDK for Java which is approaching end of support. To achieve the same functionality in the JDBC 3.x driver, use the [AWS configuration profile credentials](jdbc-v3-driver-aws-configuration-profile-credentials.md) provider instead.

### Log level
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-upgrading-log-level"></a>

The following table shows the differences in the `LogLevel` parameters in the JDBC version 2 and version 3 drivers.

| JDBC driver version | Parameter name | Parameter type | Default value | Possible values | Connection string example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v2 | LogLevel | Optional | 0 | 0-6 | LogLevel=6; |
| v3 | LogLevel | Optional | TRACE | OFF, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE | LogLevel=INFO; |

### Query ID retrieval
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-upgrading-query-id-retrieval"></a>

In the version 2 driver, you unwrap a `Statement` instance to `com.interfaces.core.IStatementQueryInfoProvider`, an interface that has two methods: `#getPReparedQueryId` and `#getQueryId`. You can use these methods to obtain the query execution ID of a query that has run.

In the version 3 driver, you unwrap `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, and `ResultSet` instances to the `com.amazon.athena.jdbc.AthenaResultSet` interface. The interface has one method: `#getQueryExecutionId`.
