# Query Apache Iceberg tables

You can use Athena to perform read, time travel, write, and DDL queries on Apache Iceberg
tables.

[Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) is an open table format
for very large analytic datasets. Iceberg manages large collections of files as tables, and
it supports modern analytical data lake operations such as record-level insert, update,
delete, and time travel queries. The Iceberg specification allows seamless table evolution
such as schema and partition evolution and is designed for optimized usage on Amazon S3. Iceberg
also helps guarantee data correctness under concurrent write scenarios.

For more information about Apache Iceberg, see [https://iceberg.apache.org/](https://iceberg.apache.org/).

## Considerations and limitations

Athena support for Iceberg tables has the following considerations and
limitations:

- Iceberg version support – Athena supports
Apache Iceberg version 1.4.2.

- Tables registered with Lake Formation – Athena does not currently
support DDL operations on Iceberg tables that are registered with Lake Formation.

- Queries against information schema –
When querying the information schema of Iceberg tables, Athena uses S3 metadata
as the source of truth for column metadata. This means that column information
is derived from the underlying S3 files rather than from the catalog metadata.
This behavior differs from other table formats where catalog metadata might be
the primary source for column information.

- Tables with AWS Glue catalog only – Only
Iceberg tables created against the AWS Glue catalog based on specifications defined
by the [open source glue catalog implementation](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/aws) are supported from
Athena.

- Table locking support by AWS Glue only –
Unlike the open source Glue catalog implementation, which supports plug-in
custom locking, Athena supports AWS Glue optimistic locking only. Using Athena to
modify an Iceberg table with any other lock implementation will cause potential
data loss and break transactions.

- Supported file formats – Athena engine version 3
supports the following Iceberg file formats.

- Parquet

- ORC

- Avro

- Iceberg restricted metadata – Lake Formation does
not evaluate the Iceberg metadata tables. Hence, the Iceberg metadata tables are
restricted if there are any Lake Formation row or cell filters present on the base table
or if you do not have permissions to view all columns in the base table. For
such cases, when you query the `$partitions`, `$files`,
`$manifests`, and `$snapshots` Iceberg metadata
tables, it fails and you get an `AccessDeniedException` error.
Additionally, the metadata column `$path` has the same Lake Formation
restrictions and fails when selected by the query. All other metadata tables can
be queried regardless of the Lake Formation filters. For more information, see [Metadata tables](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/iceberg.html).

- Iceberg v2 tables – Athena only creates
and operates on Iceberg v2 tables. For the difference between v1 and v2 tables,
see [Format version changes](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec) in the Apache Iceberg documentation.

- Display of time types without time zone
– The time and timestamp without time zone types are displayed in UTC. If
the time zone is unspecified in a filter expression on a time column, UTC is
used.

- Timestamp related data precision –
Although Iceberg supports microsecond precision for the timestamp data type,
Athena supports only millisecond precision for timestamps in both reads and
writes. For data in time related columns that is rewritten during manual
compaction operations, Athena retains only millisecond precision.

- Unsupported operations – The following
Athena operations are not supported for Iceberg tables.

- [ALTER TABLE SET LOCATION](alter-table-set-location.md)

- Views – Use `CREATE VIEW` to
create Athena views as described in [Work with views](views.md). If you are interested in using the [Iceberg view specification](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/format/view-spec.md) to create views, contact [athena-feedback@amazon.com](mailto:athena-feedback@amazon.com).

- TTF management commands not supported in
AWS Lake Formation – Although you can use Lake Formation to manage read access
permissions for TransactionTable Formats (TTFs) like Apache Iceberg, Apache
Hudi, and Linux Foundation Delta Lake, you cannot use Lake Formation to manage permissions
for operations like `VACUUM`, `MERGE`, `UPDATE`
or `OPTIMIZE` with these table formats. For more information about
Lake Formation integration with Athena, see [Using AWS Lake Formation with\
Amazon Athena](../../../lake-formation/latest/dg/athena-lf.md) in the _AWS Lake Formation Developer Guide_.

- Partitioning by nested fields –
Partitioning by nested fields is not supported. Attempting to do so produces the
message **`NOT_SUPPORTED: Partitioning by nested field is**
**unsupported:`** `column_name`. `nested_field_name`.

- Skipping Amazon Glacier objects not supported  –
If objects in the Apache Iceberg table are in an Amazon Glacier storage class, setting the
`read_restored_glacier_objects` table property to
`false` has no effect.

For example, suppose you issue the following command:

```sql

ALTER TABLE table_name SET TBLPROPERTIES ('read_restored_glacier_objects' = 'false')
```

For Iceberg and Delta Lake tables, the command produces the error
**`Unsupported table property key:**
**read_restored_glacier_objects`**. For Hudi tables, the `ALTER
                          TABLE` command does not produce an error, but Amazon Glacier objects are still
not skipped. Running `SELECT` queries after the `ALTER
                          TABLE` command continues to return all objects.

If you would like Athena to support a particular feature, send feedback to [athena-feedback@amazon.com](mailto:athena-feedback@amazon.com).
