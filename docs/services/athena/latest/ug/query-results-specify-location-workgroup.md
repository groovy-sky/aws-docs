# Specify a query result location using a workgroup

You specify the query result location in a workgroup configuration using the
AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the Athena API.

When using the AWS CLI, specify the query result location using the
`OutputLocation` parameter of the `--configuration` option
when you run the [`aws athena\
                        create-work-group`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/athena/create-work-group.html) or [`aws athena\
                        update-work-group`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/athena/update-work-group.html) command.

###### To specify the query result location for a workgroup using the Athena console

01. If the console navigation pane is not visible, choose the expansion menu
     on the left.

    ![Choose the expansion menu.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/nav-pane-expansion.png)

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Workgroups**.

03. In the list of workgroups, choose the link of the workgroup that you want
     to edit.

04. Choose **Edit**.

05. For **Query result location and encryption**, do one of
     the following:

- In the **Location of query result** box, enter
the path to a bucket in Amazon S3 for your query results. Prefix the path
with `s3://`.

- Choose **Browse S3**, choose the Amazon S3 bucket for
your current Region that you want to use, and then choose
**Choose**.

06. (Optional) For **Expected bucket owner**, enter the ID of
     the AWS account that you expect to be the owner of the output location
     bucket. This is an added security measure. If the account ID of the bucket
     owner does not match the ID that you specify here, attempts to output to the
     bucket will fail. For in-depth information, see [Verifying bucket ownership with bucket owner\
     condition](../../../s3/latest/userguide/bucket-owner-condition.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

    ###### Note

    The expected bucket owner setting applies only to the Amazon S3
    output location that you specify for Athena query results. It does not
    apply to other Amazon S3 locations like data source locations
    in external Amazon S3 buckets, `CTAS` and
    `INSERT INTO` destination table
    locations, `UNLOAD` statement output
    locations, operations to spill buckets for federated
    queries, or `SELECT` queries run against a
    table in another account.

07. (Optional) Choose **Encrypt query results** if you want
     to encrypt the query results stored in Amazon S3. For more information about
     encryption in Athena, see [Encryption at rest](encryption.md).

08. (Optional) Choose **Assign bucket owner full control over query**
    **results** to grant full control access over query results to
     the bucket owner when [ACLs are\
     enabled](../../../s3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.md) for the query result bucket. For example, if your query
     result location is owned by another account, you can grant ownership and
     full control over your query results to the other account.

    If the bucket's S3 Object Ownership setting is **Bucket owner preferred**, the bucket owner also owns all query
     result objects written from this workgroup. For example, if an external
     account's workgroup enables this option and sets its query result location
     to your account's Amazon S3 bucket which has an S3 Object Ownership setting of
     **Bucket owner preferred**, you own and
     have full control access over the external workgroup's query results.

    Selecting this option when the query result bucket's S3 Object Ownership
     setting is **Bucket owner enforced** has no
     effect. For more information, see [Controlling\
     ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket](../../../s3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.md) in the
     _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

09. If you want to require all users of the workgroup to use the query results
     location that you specified, scroll down to the
     **Settings** section and select **Override**
    **client-side settings**.

10. Choose **Save changes**.
