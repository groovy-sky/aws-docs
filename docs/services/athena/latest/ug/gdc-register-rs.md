# Register Redshift data catalogs in Athena

Athena can read and write data stored in Redshift clusters or serverless namespaces
that have been registered in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. This works in tandem with AWS Lake Formation, which
provides centralized security and governance, ensuring that data access is managed
consistently across different query engines and maintaining fine-grained access controls
for the shared Redshift data.

## Considerations and limitations

- **Materialized views** – Amazon Redshift materialized
views are queryable from Athena but creating materialized views using Athena or
Spark is not supported.

- DDL operations, including setting AWS Glue Data Catalog configuration and operations
on Amazon Redshift managed storage tables, are not supported.

## Prerequisites

Before you can query a AWS Glue data catalog from Athena, complete the following
tasks:

1. Create and register an Amazon Redshift cluster or serverless namespace to the
    AWS Glue Data Catalog. For more information, see [Registering a cluster\
    to the AWS Glue Data Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/register-cluster.html) or [Registering namespaces to the AWS Glue Data Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/serverless_datasharing-register-namespace.html) in the Amazon Redshift
    Management guide.

2. Create a data catalog in AWS Lake Formation from the registered namespace. For more
    information, see [Creating Amazon\
    Redshift federated catalogs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/create-ns-catalog.html) in the AWS Lake Formation Developer Guide.

3. (Optional) Use Lake Formation to set fine-grained access controls on the catalog. For
    more information, see [Bringing your\
    data into the AWS Glue Data Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/bring-your-data-overview.html) in the AWS Lake Formation Developer Guide.

## Register a Redshift data catalog with the Athena console

To register a Redshift data catalog with the Athena console, perform the following
steps.

01. Open the Athena console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Data sources and catalogs**.

03. On the **Data sources and catalogs** page, choose **Create data**
    **source**.

04. For **Choose a data source**, choose **Amazon S3 -**
    **AWS Glue Data Catalog**.

05. In the **AWS Glue Data Catalog** section, for **Data source**
    **account**, choose **AWS Glue Data Catalog in this**
    **account**.

06. For **Create a table or register a catalog**, choose
     **Register a new AWS Glue Catalog**.

07. In the **Data source details** section, for **Data**
    **source name**, enter the name that you want to use to specify the
     data source in your SQL queries or use the default name that is
     generated.

08. For **Catalog**, choose **Browse** to search
     for a list of AWS Glue catalogs in the same account. If you don't see any existing
     catalogs, create one in [AWS Glue console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue).

09. In the **Browse AWS Glue catalogs** dialog box, select the
     catalog that you want to use, and then choose
     **Choose**.

10. (Optional) For **Tags**, enter any key/value pairs that you
     want to associate with the data source.

11. Choose **Next**.

12. On the **Review and create** page, verify that the
     information that you entered is correct, and then choose **Create data**
    **source**.
