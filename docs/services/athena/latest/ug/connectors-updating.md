# Update a data source connector

Athena recommends that you regularly update the data source connectors that you use to the
latest version to take advantage of new features and enhancements. Updating a data source connector includes the following steps:

## AWS Glue Data Catalog federated connectors with Lambda

### Find the latest Athena Query Federation version

The latest version number of Athena data source connectors corresponds to the latest
Athena Query Federation version. In certain cases, the GitHub releases can be slightly
newer than what is available on the AWS Serverless Application Repository (SAR).

###### To find the latest Athena Query Federation version number

1. Visit the GitHub URL [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/releases/latest](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/releases/latest).

2. Note the release number in the main page heading in the following
    format:

**Release v** `year`. `week_of_year`. `iteration_of_week` **of Athena Query Federation**

For example, the release number for **Release v2023.8.3 of Athena Query**
**Federation** is 2023.8.3.

### Finding your connector version

Follow these steps to determine which version of your connector you are currently using.

###### To find your connector version

1. On the Lambda console page for your Lambda application, choose the **Image** tab.

2. Under Image tab, locate the Image URI. The URI follows this format:

```nohighlight

Image_location_account.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/athena-federation-repository:Version
```

3. The version number in the Image URI follows the format `year.week_of_year.iteration_of_week` (for example, `2021.42.1`). This number represents your connector version.

### Deploying a new connector version

Follow these steps to deploy a new version of your connector.

###### To deploy a new connector version

1. Find the desired version by following the procedure to find the latest Athena Query Federation version.

2. In the federated connector Lambda function, locate the ImageURI and update the tag to the desired version. For example:

From:

```

509399631660.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/athena-federation-repository:2025.15.1
```

To:

```

509399631660.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/athena-federation-repository:2025.26.1
```

###### Note

If your current version is older than 2025.15.1, be aware of these important changes:

- The repository name has been updated to `athena-federation-repository`

- For versions before this update, the command override may not be set. You must set it to the composite handler.

## Athena data catalog federated connectors

### Find the latest Athena Query Federation version

The latest version number of Athena data source connectors corresponds to the latest
Athena Query Federation version. In certain cases, the GitHub releases can be slightly
newer than what is available on the AWS Serverless Application Repository (SAR).

###### To find the latest Athena Query Federation version number

1. Visit the GitHub URL [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/releases/latest](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/releases/latest).

2. Note the release number in the main page heading in the following
    format:

**Release v** `year`. `week_of_year`. `iteration_of_week` **of Athena Query Federation**

For example, the release number for **Release v2023.8.3 of Athena Query**
**Federation** is 2023.8.3.

### Find and note resource names

In preparation for the upgrade, you must find and note the following
information:

1. The Lambda function name for the connector.

2. The Lambda function environment variables.

3. The Lambda application name, which manages the Lambda function for the
    connector.

###### To find resource names from the Athena console

01. Open the Athena console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

02. If the console navigation pane is not visible, choose the expansion menu
     on the left.

    ![Choose the expansion menu.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/nav-pane-expansion.png)

03. In the navigation pane, choose **Data sources and catalogs**.

04. In the **Data source name** column, choose the link to the
     data source for your connector.

05. In the **Data source details** section, under **Lambda**
    **function**, choose the link to your Lambda function.

    ![Choose the link to your Lambda function.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/connectors-updating-1.png)

06. On the **Functions** page, in the **Function**
    **name** column, note the function name for your connector.

    ![Note the function name.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/connectors-updating-2.png)

07. Choose the function name link.

08. Under the **Function overview** section, choose the
     **Configuration** tab.

09. In the pane on the left, choose **Environment**
    **variables**.

10. In the **Environment variables** section, make a note of the
     keys and their corresponding values.

11. Scroll to the top of the page.

12. In the message **This function belongs to an application. Click here**
    **to manage it**, choose the **Click here**
     link.

13. On the
     **serverlessrepo- `your_application_name`**
     page, make a note of your application name without
     **serverlessrepo**. For example, if the application name is
     **serverlessrepo-DynamoDbTestApp**, then your application
     name is **DynamoDbTestApp**.

14. Stay on the Lambda console page for your application, and then continue with
     the steps in **Finding the version of the connector that you are**
    **using**.

### Find the version of the connector that you are using

Follow these steps to find the version of the connector that you are using.

###### To find the version of the connector that you are using

1. On the Lambda console page for your Lambda application, choose the
    **Deployments** tab.

2. On the **Deployments** tab, expand **SAM**
**template**.

3. Search for **CodeUri**.

4. In the **Key** field under **CodeUri**, find
    the following string:

```nohighlight

applications-connector_name-versions-year.week_of_year.iteration_of_week/hash_number
```

The following example shows a string for the CloudWatch connector:

```nohighlight

applications-AthenaCloudwatchConnector-versions-2021.42.1/15151159...
```

5. Record the value for
    `year`. `week_of_year`. `iteration_of_week`
    (for example, **2021.42.1**). This is the version for your
    connector.

### Deploy the new version of your connector

Follow these steps to deploy a new version of your connector.

###### To deploy a new version of your connector

01. Open the Athena console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

02. If the console navigation pane is not visible, choose the expansion menu
     on the left.

    ![Choose the expansion menu.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/nav-pane-expansion.png)

03. In the navigation pane, choose **Data sources and catalogs**.

04. On the **Data sources and catalogs** page, choose **Create data**
    **source**.

05. Choose the data source that you want to upgrade, and then choose
     **Next**.

06. In the **Connection details** section, choose
     **Create Lambda function**. This opens the Lambda console
     where you will be able to deploy your updated application.

    ![Connector page in the AWS Lambda console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/connectors-updating-3.png)

07. Because you are not actually creating a new data source, you can close the
     Athena console tab.

08. On the Lambda console page for the connector, perform the following
     steps:
    1. Ensure that you have removed the **serverlessrepo-**
        prefix from your application name, and then copy the application name to
        the **Application name** field.

    2. Copy your Lambda function name to the
        **AthenaCatalogName** field. Some connectors call
        this field **LambdaFunctionName**.

    3. Copy the environment variables that you recorded into their
        corresponding fields.
09. Select the option **I acknowledge that this app creates custom IAM**
    **roles and resource policies**, and then choose
     **Deploy**.

10. To verify that your application has been updated, choose the
     **Deployments** tab.

    The **Deployment history** section shows that your update is
     complete.

    ![Connector update completed.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/connectors-updating-4.png)

11. To confirm the new version number, you can expand **SAM**
    **template** as before, find **CodeUri**, and check
     the connector version number in the **Key** field.

You can now use your updated connector to create Athena federated queries.
