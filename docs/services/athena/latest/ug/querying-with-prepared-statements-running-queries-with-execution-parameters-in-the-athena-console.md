# Run queries with execution parameters in the Athena console

When you run a parameterized query that has execution parameters (question marks)
in the Athena console, you are prompted for the values in the order in which the
question marks occur in the query.

###### To run a query that has execution parameters

1. Enter a query with question mark placeholders in the Athena editor, as in
    the following example.

```sql

SELECT * FROM "my_database"."my_table"
WHERE year = ? and month= ? and day= ?
```

2. Choose **Run.**

3. In the **Enter parameters** dialog box, enter a value in
    order for each of the question marks in the query.

4. When you are finished entering the parameters, choose
    **Run**. The editor shows the query results for the
    parameter values that you entered.

At this point, you can do one of the following:

- Enter different parameter values for the same query, and then choose
**Run again**.

- To clear all of the values that you entered at once, choose
**Clear**.

- To edit the query directly (for example, to add or remove question marks),
close the **Enter parameters** dialog box first.

- To save the parameterized query for later use, choose
**Save** or **Save as**, and then give
the query a name. For more information about using saved queries, see [Use saved queries](saved-queries.md).

As a convenience, the **Enter parameters** dialog box remembers
the values that you entered previously for the query as long as you use the same tab
in the query editor.
