# Create and query a table for alert logs

1. Modify the following sample DDL statement to conform to the structure of your
    alert log. You may need to update the statement to include the columns for the
    latest version of the logs. For more information, see [Contents of a firewall log](../../../network-firewall/latest/developerguide/firewall-logging.md#firewall-logging-contents) in the
    _AWS Network Firewall Developer Guide_.

```sql

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE network_firewall_alert_logs (
     firewall_name string,
     availability_zone string,
     event_timestamp string,
     event struct<
       timestamp:string,
       flow_id:bigint,
       event_type:string,
       src_ip:string,
       src_port:int,
       dest_ip:string,
       dest_port:int,
       proto:string,
       app_proto:string,
       sni:string,
       tls_inspected:boolean,
       tls_error:struct<
         error_message:string>,
       revocation_check:struct<
         leaf_cert_fpr:string,
         status:string,
         action:string>,
       alert:struct<
         alert_id:string,
         alert_type:string,
         action:string,
         signature_id:int,
         rev:int,
         signature:string,
         category:string,
         severity:int,
         rule_name:string,
         alert_name:string,
         alert_severity:string,
         alert_description:string,
         file_name:string,
         file_hash:string,
         packet_capture:string,
         reference_links:array<string>
       >,
       src_country:string,
       dest_country:string,
       src_hostname:string,
       dest_hostname:string,
       user_agent:string,
       url:string
      >
)
    ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
    LOCATION 's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path_to_alert_logs_folder/';
```

2. Modify the `LOCATION` clause to specify the folder for your logs in
    Amazon S3.

3. Run your `CREATE TABLE` query in the Athena query editor. After the
    query completes, Athena registers the `network_firewall_alert_logs`
    table, making the data that it points to ready for queries.

## Example query

The sample alert log query in this section filters for events in which TLS
inspection was performed that have alerts with a severity level of 2 or
higher.

The query uses aliases to create output column headings that show the
`struct` that the column belongs to. For example, the column heading
for the `event.alert.category` field is `event_alert_category`
instead of just `category`. To customize the column names further, you
can modify the aliases to suit your preferences. For example, you can use
underscores or other separators to delimit the `struct` names and field
names.

Remember to modify column names and `struct` references based on your
table definition and on the fields that you want in the query result.

  event.timestamp AS event_timestamp,
