# Authenticate with Snowflake

You can configure the Amazon Athena Snowflake connector to use either the key-pair
authentication or OAuth authentication method to connect to your Snowflake data warehouse.
Both methods provide secure access to Snowflake and eliminate the need to store passwords in
connection strings.

- **Key-pair authentication** – This method
uses RSA public or private key pairs to authenticate with Snowflake. The private key
digitally signs authentication requests while the corresponding public key is
registered in Snowflake for verification. This method eliminates password
storage.

- **OAuth authentication** – This method
uses authorization token and refresh token to authenticate with Snowflake. It
supports automatic token refresh, making it suitable for long-running
applications.

For more information, see the [Key-pair\
authentication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth) and [OAuth authentication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/oauth-custom)
in the Snowflake user guide.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, complete the following prerequisites:

- Snowflake account access with administrative privileges.

- Snowflake user account dedicated for the Athena connector.

- OpenSSL or equivalent key generation tools for key-pair authentication.

- AWS Secrets Manager access to create and manage secrets.

- Web browser to complete the OAuth flow for the OAuth authentication.

## Configure key-pair authentication

This process involves generating an RSA key-pair, configuring your Snowflake account
with the public key, and securely storing the private key in AWS Secrets Manager. The following
steps will guide you through creating the cryptographic keys, setting up the necessary
Snowflake permissions, and configuring AWS credentials for seamless authentication.

1. **Generate RSA key-pair**

Generate a private and public key pair using OpenSSL.

- To generate an unencrypted version, use the following command in your local command line
application.

```bash

openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -out rsa_key.p8 -nocrypt
```

- To generate an encrypted version, use the following command, which omits
`-nocrypt`.

```bash

openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -v2 des3 -inform PEM -out rsa_key.p8
```

- To generate a public key from a private key.

```bash

openssl rsa -in rsa_key.p8 -pubout -out rsa_key.pub
# Set appropriate permissions (Unix/Linux)
chmod 600 rsa_key.p8
chmod 644 rsa_key.pub
```

###### Note

Do not share your private key. The private key should only be accessible to the application that needs to authenticate with Snowflake.

2. **Extract public key content without delimiters for**
**Snowflake**

```bash

# Extract public key content (remove BEGIN/END lines and newlines)
cat rsa_key.pub | grep -v "BEGIN\|END" | tr -d '\n'
```

Save this output as you will need it later in the next step.

3. **Configure Snowflake user**

Follow these steps to configure a Snowflake user.
1. Create a dedicated user for the Athena connector if it doesn't already
       exists.

      ```sql

      -- Create user for Athena connector
      CREATE USER athena_connector_user;

      -- Grant necessary privileges
      GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE your_warehouse TO ROLE athena_connector_role;
      GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE your_database TO ROLE athena_connector_role;
      GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE your_database TO ROLE athena_connector_role;
      ```

2. Grant authentication privileges. To assign a public key to a user, you must have one of the
       following roles or privileges.

- The `MODIFY PROGRAMMATIC AUTHENTICATION METHODS` or `OWNERSHIP` privilege on the user.

- The `SECURITYADMIN` role or higher.

Grant the necessary privileges to assign public keys with the
following command.

```sql

GRANT MODIFY PROGRAMMATIC AUTHENTICATION METHODS ON USER athena_connector_user TO ROLE your_admin_role;
```

3. Assign the public key to the Snowflake user with the following
       command.

      ```sql

      ALTER USER athena_connector_user SET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY='RSAkey';
      ```

      Verify that the public key is successfully assigned to the user with
       the following command.

      ```sql

      DESC USER athena_connector_user;
      ```
4. **Store private key in AWS Secrets Manager**

1. Convert your private key to the format required by the connector.

      ```bash

      # Read private key content
      cat rsa_key.p8
      ```

2. Create a secret in AWS Secrets Manager with the following structure.

      ```json

      {
        "sfUser": "your_snowflake_user",
        "pem_private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----",
        "pem_private_key_passphrase": "passphrase_in_case_of_encrypted_private_key(optional)"
      }
      ```

      ###### Note

- Header and footer are optional.

- The private key must be separated by `\n`.

## Configure OAuth authentication

This authentication method enables secure, token-based access to Snowflake with
automatic credential refresh capabilities. The configuration process involves creating a
security integration in Snowflake, retrieving OAuth client credentials, completing the
authorization flow to obtain an access code, and storing the OAuth credentials in
AWS Secrets Manager for the connector to use.

1. **Create a security integration in Snowflake**

Execute the following SQL command in Snowflake to create a Snowflake OAuth
    security integration.

```sql

CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION my_snowflake_oauth_integration_a
     TYPE = OAUTH
     ENABLED = TRUE
     OAUTH_CLIENT = CUSTOM
     OAUTH_CLIENT_TYPE = 'CONFIDENTIAL'
     OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI = 'https://localhost:8080/oauth/callback'
     OAUTH_ISSUE_REFRESH_TOKENS = TRUE
     OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_VALIDITY = 7776000;
```

**Configuration parameters**

- `TYPE = OAUTH` – Specifies OAuth authentication
type.

- `ENABLED = TRUE` – Enables the security
integration.

- `OAUTH_CLIENT = CUSTOM` – Uses custom OAuth client
configuration.

- `OAUTH_CLIENT_TYPE = 'CONFIDENTIAL'` – Sets client
type for secure applications.

- `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` – The callback URL for OAuth
flow. It can be localhost for testing.

- `OAUTH_ISSUE_REFRESH_TOKENS = TRUE` – Enables
refresh token generation.

- `OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_VALIDITY = 7776000` – Sets
refresh token validity (90 days in seconds).

2. **Retrieve OAuth client secrets**

1. Run the following SQL command to get the client credentials.

      ```sql

      DESC SECURITY INTEGRATION 'MY_SNOWFLAKE_OAUTH_INTEGRATION_A';
      ```

2. Retrieve the OAuth client secrets.

      ```sql

      SELECT SYSTEM$SHOW_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS('MY_SNOWFLAKE_OAUTH_INTEGRATION_A');
      ```

      **Example response**

      ```json

      {
        "OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_2": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
        "OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET": "je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY,
        "OAUTH_CLIENT_ID": "AIDACKCEVSQ6C2EXAMPLE"
      }
      ```

###### Note

Keep these credentials secure and do not share them. These will be used to configure the OAuth client.

3. **Authorize user and retrieve authorization code**

1. Open the following URL in a browser.

      ```nohighlight

      https://<your_account>.snowflakecomputing.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=<OAUTH_CLIENT_ID>&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://localhost:8080/oauth/callback
      ```

2. Complete the authorization flow.

1. Sign in using your Snowflake credentials.

2. Grant the requested permissions. You will be redirected to the callback URI
    with an authorization code.

3. Extract the authorization code by copying the code parameter from the redirect URL.

      ```nohighlight

      https://localhost:8080/oauth/callback?code=<authorizationcode>
      ```

      ###### Note

      The authorization code is valid for a limited time and can only be used once.
4. **Store OAuth credentials in AWS Secrets Manager**

Create a secret in AWS Secrets Manager with the following structure.

```json

{
     "redirect_uri": "https://localhost:8080/oauth/callback",
     "client_secret": "je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY",
     "token_url": "https://<your_account>.snowflakecomputing.com/oauth/token-request",
     "client_id": "AIDACKCEVSQ6C2EXAMPLE,
     "username": "your_snowflake_username",
     "auth_code": "authorizationcode"
}
```

**Required fields**

- `redirect_uri` – OAuth redirect URI that you
obtained from Step 1.

- `client_secret` – OAuth client secret that you
obtained from Step 2.

- `token_url` – Snowflake The OAuth token
endpoint.

- `client_id` – The OAuth client ID from Step
2.

- `username` – The Snowflake username for the
connector.

- `auth_code` – The authorization code that you
obtained from Step 3.

After you create a secret, you get a secret ARN that you can use in your Glue connection
when you [create a data source connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-to-a-data-source.html).
