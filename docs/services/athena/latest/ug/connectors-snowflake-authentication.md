# Authenticate with Snowflake
<a name="connectors-snowflake-authentication"></a>

You can configure the Amazon Athena Snowflake connector to use either the key-pair authentication or OAuth authentication method to connect to your Snowflake data warehouse. Both methods provide secure access to Snowflake and eliminate the need to store passwords in connection strings.
+ **Key-pair authentication** – This method uses RSA public or private key pairs to authenticate with Snowflake. The private key digitally signs authentication requests while the corresponding public key is registered in Snowflake for verification. This method eliminates password storage.
+ **OAuth authentication** – This method uses authorization token and refresh token to authenticate with Snowflake. It supports automatic token refresh, making it suitable for long-running applications.

For more information, see the [Key-pair authentication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth) and [OAuth authentication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/oauth-custom) in the Snowflake user guide.

## Prerequisites
<a name="connectors-snowflake-authentication-prerequisites"></a>

Before you begin, complete the following prerequisites:
+ Snowflake account access with administrative privileges.
+ Snowflake user account dedicated for the Athena connector.
+ OpenSSL or equivalent key generation tools for key-pair authentication.
+ AWS Secrets Manager access to create and manage secrets.
+ Web browser to complete the OAuth flow for the OAuth authentication.

## Configure key-pair authentication
<a name="connectors-snowflake-keypair-authentication"></a>

This process involves generating an RSA key-pair, configuring your Snowflake account with the public key, and securely storing the private key in AWS Secrets Manager. The following steps will guide you through creating the cryptographic keys, setting up the necessary Snowflake permissions, and configuring AWS credentials for seamless authentication.

1. **Generate RSA key-pair**

   Generate a private and public key pair using OpenSSL.
   + To generate an unencrypted version, use the following command in your local command line application.

     ```
     openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -out rsa_key.p8 -nocrypt
     ```
   + To generate an encrypted version, use the following command, which omits `-nocrypt`.

     ```
     openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -v2 des3 -inform PEM -out rsa_key.p8
     ```
   + To generate a public key from a private key.

     ```
     openssl rsa -in rsa_key.p8 -pubout -out rsa_key.pub
     # Set appropriate permissions (Unix/Linux)
     chmod 600 rsa_key.p8
     chmod 644 rsa_key.pub
     ```
**Note**
Do not share your private key. The private key should only be accessible to the application that needs to authenticate with Snowflake.

1. **Extract public key content without delimiters for Snowflake**

   ```
   # Extract public key content (remove BEGIN/END lines and newlines)
   cat rsa_key.pub | grep -v "BEGIN\|END" | tr -d '\n'
   ```

   Save this output as you will need it later in the next step.

1. **Configure Snowflake user**

   Follow these steps to configure a Snowflake user.

   1. Create a dedicated user for the Athena connector if it doesn't already exists.

      ```
      -- Create user for Athena connector
      CREATE USER {{athena_connector_user}};

      -- Grant necessary privileges
      GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE {{your_warehouse}} TO ROLE {{athena_connector_role}};
      GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE {{your_database}} TO ROLE {{athena_connector_role}};
      GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE {{your_database}} TO ROLE {{athena_connector_role}};
      ```

   1. Grant authentication privileges. To assign a public key to a user, you must have one of the following roles or privileges.
      + The `MODIFY PROGRAMMATIC AUTHENTICATION METHODS` or `OWNERSHIP` privilege on the user.
      + The `SECURITYADMIN` role or higher.

      Grant the necessary privileges to assign public keys with the following command.

      ```
      GRANT MODIFY PROGRAMMATIC AUTHENTICATION METHODS ON USER {{athena_connector_user}} TO ROLE {{your_admin_role}};
      ```

   1. Assign the public key to the Snowflake user with the following command.

      ```
      ALTER USER {{athena_connector_user}} SET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY='{{RSAkey}}';
      ```

      Verify that the public key is successfully assigned to the user with the following command.

      ```
      DESC USER {{athena_connector_user}};
      ```

1. **Store private key in AWS Secrets Manager**

   1. Convert your private key to the format required by the connector.

      ```
      # Read private key content
      cat rsa_key.p8
      ```

   1. Create a secret in AWS Secrets Manager with the following structure.

      ```
      {
        "sfUser": "{{your_snowflake_user}}",
        "pem_private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----",
        "pem_private_key_passphrase": "{{passphrase_in_case_of_encrypted_private_key(optional)}}"
      }
      ```
**Note**
Header and footer are optional.
The private key must be separated by `\n`.

## Configure OAuth authentication
<a name="connectors-snowflake-oauth-authentication"></a>

This authentication method enables secure, token-based access to Snowflake with automatic credential refresh capabilities. The configuration process involves creating a security integration in Snowflake, retrieving OAuth client credentials, completing the authorization flow to obtain an access code, and storing the OAuth credentials in AWS Secrets Manager for the connector to use.

1. **Create a security integration in Snowflake**

   Execute the following SQL command in Snowflake to create a Snowflake OAuth security integration.

   ```
   CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION {{my_snowflake_oauth_integration_a}}
     TYPE = OAUTH
     ENABLED = TRUE
     OAUTH_CLIENT = CUSTOM
     OAUTH_CLIENT_TYPE = 'CONFIDENTIAL'
     OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI = 'https://localhost:8080/oauth/callback'
     OAUTH_ISSUE_REFRESH_TOKENS = TRUE
     OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_VALIDITY = 7776000;
   ```

   **Configuration parameters**
   + `TYPE = OAUTH` – Specifies OAuth authentication type.
   + `ENABLED = TRUE` – Enables the security integration.
   + `OAUTH_CLIENT = CUSTOM` – Uses custom OAuth client configuration.
   + `OAUTH_CLIENT_TYPE = 'CONFIDENTIAL'` – Sets client type for secure applications.
   + `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` – The callback URL for OAuth flow. It can be localhost for testing.
   + `OAUTH_ISSUE_REFRESH_TOKENS = TRUE` – Enables refresh token generation.
   + `OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_VALIDITY = 7776000` – Sets refresh token validity (90 days in seconds).

1. **Retrieve OAuth client secrets**

   1. Run the following SQL command to get the client credentials.

      ```
      DESC SECURITY INTEGRATION '{{MY_SNOWFLAKE_OAUTH_INTEGRATION_A}}';
      ```

   1. Retrieve the OAuth client secrets.

      ```
      SELECT SYSTEM$SHOW_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS('{{MY_SNOWFLAKE_OAUTH_INTEGRATION_A}}');
      ```

      **Example response**

      ```
      {
        "OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_2": "{{wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY}}",
        "OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET": "{{je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY}},
        "OAUTH_CLIENT_ID": "{{AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED}}"
      }
      ```
**Note**
Keep these credentials secure and do not share them. These will be used to configure the OAuth client.

1. **Authorize user and retrieve authorization code**

   1. Open the following URL in a browser.

      ```
      https://{{<your_account>}}.snowflakecomputing.com/oauth/authorize?client_id={{<OAUTH_CLIENT_ID>}}&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://localhost:8080/oauth/callback
      ```

   1. Complete the authorization flow.

      1. Sign in using your Snowflake credentials.

      1. Grant the requested permissions. You will be redirected to the callback URI with an authorization code.

   1. Extract the authorization code by copying the code parameter from the redirect URL.

      ```
      https://localhost:8080/oauth/callback?code={{<authorizationcode>}}
      ```
**Note**
The authorization code is valid for a limited time and can only be used once.

1. **Store OAuth credentials in AWS Secrets Manager**

   Create a secret in AWS Secrets Manager with the following structure.

   ```
   {
     "redirect_uri": "https://localhost:8080/oauth/callback",
     "client_secret": "{{je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY}}",
     "token_url": "https://<{{your_account}}>.snowflakecomputing.com/oauth/token-request",
     "client_id": "{{AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED}},
     "username": "{{your_snowflake_username}}",
     "auth_code": "{{authorizationcode}}"
   }
   ```

   **Required fields**
   + `redirect_uri` – OAuth redirect URI that you obtained from Step 1.
   + `client_secret` – OAuth client secret that you obtained from Step 2.
   + `token_url` – Snowflake The OAuth token endpoint.
   + `client_id` – The OAuth client ID from Step 2.
   + `username` – The Snowflake username for the connector.
   + `auth_code` – The authorization code that you obtained from Step 3.

After you create a secret, you get a secret ARN that you can use in your Glue connection when you [create a data source connection](connect-to-a-data-source.md).
