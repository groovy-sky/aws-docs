# Change a column data type

You might want to use a different column type when the existing type can no longer
hold the amount of information required. For example, an ID column's values might exceed
the size of the `INT` data type and require the use of the
`BIGINT` data type.

## Considerations

When planning to use a different data type for a column, consider the following
points:

- In most cases, you cannot change the data type of a column directly.
Instead, you re-create the Athena table and define the column with the new
data type.

- Only certain data types can be read as other data types. See the table in
this section for data types that can be so treated.

- For data in Parquet and ORC, you cannot use a different data type for a
column if the table is not partitioned.

- For partitioned tables in Parquet and ORC, a partition's column type can
be different from another partition's column type, and Athena will
`CAST` to the desired type, if possible. For information, see
[Avoid schema mismatch errors for tables with partitions](updates-and-partitions.md#partitions-dealing-with-schema-mismatch-errors).

- For tables created using the [LazySimpleSerDe](lazy-simple-serde.md) only, it is
possible to use the `ALTER TABLE REPLACE COLUMNS` statement to
replace existing columns with a different data type, but all existing
columns that you want to keep must also be redefined in the statement, or
they will be dropped. For more information, see [ALTER TABLE REPLACE COLUMNS](alter-table-replace-columns.md).

- For Apache Iceberg tables only, you can use the [ALTER TABLE CHANGE COLUMN](querying-iceberg-alter-table-change-column.md) statement
to change the data type of a column. `ALTER TABLE REPLACE
                              COLUMNS` is not supported for Iceberg tables. For more
information, see [Evolve Iceberg table schema](querying-iceberg-evolving-table-schema.md).

###### Important

We strongly suggest that you test and verify your queries before performing
data type translations. If Athena cannot use the target data type, the
`CREATE TABLE` query may fail.

## Use compatible data types

Whenever possible, use compatible data types. The following table lists data types
that can be treated as other data types:

Original data typeAvailable target data types`STRING``BYTE`, `TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`,
`INT`, `BIGINT``BYTE``TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`, `INT`,
`BIGINT``TINYINT``SMALLINT`, `INT`,
`BIGINT``SMALLINT``INT`, `BIGINT``INT``BIGINT``FLOAT``DOUBLE`

The following example uses the `CREATE TABLE` statement for the
original `orders_json` table to create a new table called
`orders_json_bigint`. The new table uses `BIGINT` instead
of `INT` as the data type for the `` `o_shippriority` `` column.

```sql

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE orders_json_bigint (
   `o_orderkey` int,
   `o_custkey` int,
   `o_orderstatus` string,
   `o_totalprice` double,
   `o_orderdate` string,
   `o_orderpriority` string,
   `o_clerk` string,
   `o_shippriority` BIGINT
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
LOCATION 's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/orders_json';
```

The following query runs successfully, similar to the original `SELECT`
query, before the data type change:

```

Select * from orders_json
LIMIT 10;
```
