# Overcome the 68k code block size limit
<a name="notebooks-spark-troubleshooting-code-block-size-limit"></a>

Athena for Spark has a known calculation code block size limit of 68000 characters. When you run a calculation with a code block over this limit, you can receive the following error message:

 '...' at 'codeBlock' failed to satisfy constraint: Member must have length less than or equal to 68000

The following image shows this error in the Athena console notebook editor.

The same error can occur when you use the AWS CLI to run a calculation that has a large code block, as in the following example.

```
aws athena start-calculation-execution \
    --session-id "{{{SESSION_ID}}}" \
    --description "{{{SESSION_DESCRIPTION}}}" \
    --code-block "{{{LARGE_CODE_BLOCK}}}"
```

The command gives the following error message:

{{{LARGE\_CODE\_BLOCK}}} at 'codeBlock' failed to satisfy constraint: Member must have length less than or equal to 68000

## Workaround
<a name="notebooks-spark-troubleshooting-code-block-size-limit-workaround"></a>

To work around this issue, upload the file that has your query or calculation code to Amazon S3. Then, use boto3 to read the file and run your SQL or code.

The following examples assume that you have already uploaded the file that has your SQL query or Python code to Amazon S3.

### SQL example
<a name="notebooks-spark-troubleshooting-code-block-size-limit-sql-example"></a>

The following example code reads the `large_sql_query.sql` file from an Amazon S3 bucket and then runs the large query that the file contains.

```
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
def read_s3_content({{bucket_name}}, {{key}}):
    response = s3.Object({{bucket_name}}, {{key}}).get()
    return response['Body'].read()

# SQL
sql = read_s3_content('{{bucket_name}}', 'large_sql_query.sql')
df = spark.sql(sql)
```

### PySpark example
<a name="notebooks-spark-troubleshooting-code-block-size-limit-pyspark-example"></a>

The following code example reads the `large_py_spark.py` file from Amazon S3 and then runs the large code block that is in the file.

```
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

def read_s3_content({{bucket_name}}, {{key}}):
    response = s3.Object({{bucket_name}}, {{key}}).get()
    return response['Body'].read()

# PySpark
py_spark_code = read_s3_content('{{bucket_name}}', 'large_py_spark.py')
exec(py_spark_code)
```
