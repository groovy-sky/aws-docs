# Lazy Simple SerDe for CSV, TSV, and custom-delimited files

Because this is the default SerDe in Athena for data in CSV, TSV, and custom-delimited
formats, specifying it is optional. In your `CREATE TABLE` statement, if you
don't specify a SerDe and specify only `ROW FORMAT DELIMITED`, Athena uses this
SerDe. Use this SerDe if your data does not have values enclosed in quotes.

For reference documentation about the Lazy Simple SerDe, see the [Hive SerDe](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/DeveloperGuide) section of the Apache Hive Developer Guide.

## Serialization library name

The serialization library name for the Lazy Simple SerDe is
`org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe`. For source code
information, see [LazySimpleSerDe.java](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/serde/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/lazy/LazySimpleSerDe.java) on GitHub.com.

## Ignoring headers

To ignore headers in your data when you define a table, you can use the
`skip.header.line.count` table property, as in the following
example.

```sql

TBLPROPERTIES ("skip.header.line.count"="1")
```

For examples that ignore headers, see the `CREATE TABLE` statements in
[Query Amazon VPC flow logs](vpc-flow-logs.md) and [Query Amazon CloudFront logs](cloudfront-logs.md).

The following example shows how to use the `LazySimpleSerDe` library to
create a table in Athena from CSV data. To deserialize custom-delimited files using
this SerDe, follow the pattern in the examples but use the `FIELDS TERMINATED
                    BY` clause to specify a different single-character delimiter. Lazy Simple
SerDe does not support multi-character delimiters.

###### Note

Replace `myregion` in `s3://athena-examples-myregion/path/to/data/` with the region identifier where you run Athena, for example, `s3://athena-examples-us-west-1/path/to/data/`.

Use the `CREATE TABLE` statement to create an Athena table from the
underlying data in CSV stored in Amazon S3.

Run `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` to refresh partition metadata each time a new
partition is added to this table:

```sql

MSCK REPAIR TABLE flight_delays_csv;
```

Query the top 10 routes delayed by more than 1 hour:

```sql

SELECT origin, dest, count(*) as delays
FROM flight_delays_csv
WHERE depdelayminutes > 60
GROUP BY origin, dest
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

###### Note

The flight table data comes from [Flights](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236) provided by US Department of Transportation, [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/). Desaturated from original.

To create an Athena table from TSV data stored in Amazon S3, use `ROW FORMAT
                    DELIMITED` and specify the `\t` as the tab field delimiter,
`\n` as the line separator, and `\` as the escape
character. The following excerpt shows this syntax. No sample TSV flight data is
available in the `athena-examples` location, but as with the CSV
table, you would run `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` to refresh partition metadata
each time a new partition is added.

```sql

...
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'
ESCAPED BY '\\'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
...
```
