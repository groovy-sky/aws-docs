# VACUUM

The `VACUUM` statement performs table maintenance on Apache Iceberg tables by
performing [snapshot\
expiration](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-procedures) and [orphan file removal](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-procedures).

###### Note

`VACUUM` is transactional and is supported only for Apache Iceberg tables
in Athena engine version 3.

The `VACUUM` statement optimizes Iceberg tables by reducing storage
consumption. For more information about using `VACUUM`, see [Optimize Iceberg tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/querying-iceberg-data-optimization.html). Note that, because the
`VACUUM` statement makes API calls to Amazon S3, charges apply for the associated
requests to Amazon S3.

###### Warning

If you run a snapshot expiration operation, you can no longer time travel to expired
snapshots.

## Synopsis

To remove data files no longer needed for an Iceberg table, use the following
syntax.

```sql

VACUUM [database_name.]target_table
```

- `VACUUM` expects the Iceberg data to be in an Amazon S3 folder rather
than an Amazon S3 bucket. For example, if your Iceberg data is at
`s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket`/ instead of
`s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/myicebergfolder/`, the
`VACUUM` statement fails with the error message
**`GENERIC_INTERNAL_ERROR: Path missing in file system location:**
**s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket`**.

- For `VACUUM` to be able to delete data files, your query execution
role must have `s3:DeleteObject` permissions on the bucket where your
Iceberg tables, metadata, snapshots, and data files are located. If the
permission is not present, the `VACUUM` query will succeed, but the
files will not be deleted.

- To run `VACUUM` on a table with a name that begins with an
underscore (for example, `_mytable`), enclose the table name in
backticks, as in the following example. If you prefix the table name with a
database name, do not enclose the database name in backticks. Note that double
quotes will not work in place of backticks.

This behavior is particular to `VACUUM`. The `CREATE`
and `INSERT INTO` statements do not require backticks for table names
that begin with underscores.

```sql

VACUUM `_mytable`
VACUUM my_database.`_mytable`
```

## Operations performed

`VACUUM` performs the following operations:

- Removes snapshots that are older than the amount of time that is specified by
the `vacuum_max_snapshot_age_seconds` table property. By default,
this property is set to 432000 seconds (5 days).

- Removes snapshots that are not within the period to be retained that are in
excess of the number specified by the `vacuum_min_snapshots_to_keep`
table property. The default is 1.

You can specify these table properties in your `CREATE TABLE`
statement. After the table has been created, you can use the [ALTER TABLE SET TBLPROPERTIES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/querying-iceberg-alter-table-set-properties.html) statement to
update them.

- Removes any metadata and data files that are unreachable as a result of the
snapshot removal. You can configure the number of old metadata files to be
retained by setting the `vacuum_max_metadata_files_to_keep` table
property. The default value is 100.

- Removes orphan files that are older than the time specified in the
`vacuum_max_snapshot_age_seconds` table property. Orphan files
are files in the table's data directory that are not part of the table
state.
