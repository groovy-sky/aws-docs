# AWS managed policies for Amazon Athena
<a name="security-iam-awsmanpol"></a>

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles.

Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because they're available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining [ customer managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#customer-managed-policies) that are specific to your use cases.

You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for existing services.

For more information, see [AWS managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) in the *IAM User Guide*.

## Considerations when using managed policies with Athena
<a name="managed-policies-considerations"></a>

Managed policies are easy to use and are updated automatically with the required actions as the service evolves. When using managed policies with Athena, keep the following points in mind:
+ To allow or deny Amazon Athena service actions for yourself or other users using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), you attach identity-based policies to principals, such as users or groups.
+ Each identity-based policy consists of statements that define the actions that are allowed or denied. For more information and step-by-step instructions for attaching a policy to a user, see [Attaching managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-using.html#attach-managed-policy-console) in the *IAM User Guide*. For a list of actions, see the [Amazon Athena API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/).
+  *Customer-managed* and *inline* identity-based policies allow you to specify more detailed Athena actions within a policy to fine-tune access. We recommend that you use the `AmazonAthenaFullAccess` policy as a starting point and then allow or deny specific actions listed in the [Amazon Athena API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/). For more information about inline policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
+ If you also have principals that connect using JDBC, you must provide the JDBC driver credentials to your application. For more information, see [Control access through JDBC and ODBC connections](policy-actions.md).
+ If you have encrypted the AWS Glue Data Catalog, you must specify additional actions in the identity-based IAM policies for Athena. For more information, see [Configure access from Athena to encrypted metadata in the AWS Glue Data Catalog](access-encrypted-data-glue-data-catalog.md).
+ If you create and use workgroups, make sure your policies include relevant access to workgroup actions. For detailed information, see [Use IAM policies to control workgroup access](workgroups-iam-policy.md) and [Example workgroup policies](example-policies-workgroup.md).

## AWS managed policy: AmazonAthenaFullAccess
<a name="amazonathenafullaccess-managed-policy"></a>

The `AmazonAthenaFullAccess` managed policy grants full access to Athena.

To provide access, add permissions to your users, groups, or roles:
+ Users and groups in AWS IAM Identity Center:

  Create a permission set. Follow the instructions in [Create a permission set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtocreatepermissionset.html) in the *AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide*.
+ Users managed in IAM through an identity provider:

  Create a role for identity federation. Follow the instructions in [Create a role for a third-party identity provider (federation)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
+ IAM users:
  + Create a role that your user can assume. Follow the instructions in [Create a role for an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
  + (Not recommended) Attach a policy directly to a user or add a user to a user group. Follow the instructions in [Adding permissions to a user (console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html#users_change_permissions-add-console) in the *IAM User Guide*.

### Permissions groupings
<a name="amazonathenafullaccess-managed-policy-groupings"></a>

The `AmazonAthenaFullAccess` policy is grouped into the following sets of permissions.
+ **`athena`** – Allows principals access to Athena resources.
+ **`glue`** – Allows principals access to AWS Glue Catalogs, databases, tables, and partitions. This is required so that the principal can use the AWS Glue Data Catalogs with Athena.
+ **`s3`** – Allows the principal to write and read query results from Amazon S3, to read publically available Athena data examples that reside in Amazon S3, and to list buckets. This is required so that the principal can use Athena to work with Amazon S3.
+ **`sns`** – Allows principals to list Amazon SNS topics and get topic attributes. This enables principals to use Amazon SNS topics with Athena for monitoring and alert purposes.
+ **`cloudwatch`** – Allows principals to create, read, and delete CloudWatch alarms. For more information, see [Use CloudWatch and EventBridge to monitor queries and control costs](workgroups-control-limits.md).
+ **`lakeformation`** – Allows principals to request temporary credentials to access data in a data lake location that is registered with Lake Formation. For more information, see [Underlying data access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/access-control-underlying-data.html) in the *AWS Lake Formation Developer Guide*.
+ **`datazone`** – Allows principals to list Amazon DataZone projects, domains, and environments. For information about using DataZone in Athena, see [Use Amazon DataZone in Athena](datazone-using.md).
+ **`pricing`** – Provides access to AWS Billing and Cost Management. For more information, see [GetProducts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_pricing_GetProducts.html) in the *AWS Billing and Cost Management API Reference*.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonAthenaFullAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonAthenaFullAccess.html) in the AWS Managed Policy Reference.

**Note**
You must explicitly allow access to service-owned Amazon S3 buckets to store example queries and sample dataset. For more information, see [Data perimeters](data-perimeters.md).

## AWS managed policy: AWSQuicksightAthenaAccess
<a name="awsquicksightathenaaccess-managed-policy"></a>

`AWSQuicksightAthenaAccess` grants access to actions that Quick requires for integration with Athena. You can attach the `AWSQuicksightAthenaAccess` policy to your IAM identities. Attach this policy only to principals who use Quick with Athena. This policy includes some actions for Athena that are either deprecated and not included in the current public API, or that are used only with the JDBC and ODBC drivers.

### Permissions groupings
<a name="awsquicksightathenaaccess-managed-policy-groupings"></a>

The `AWSQuicksightAthenaAccess` policy is grouped into the following sets of permissions.
+ **`athena`** – Allows the principal to run queries on Athena resources.
+ **`glue`** – Allows principals access to AWS Glue Catalogs, databases, tables, and partitions. This is required so that the principal can use the AWS Glue Data Catalogs with Athena.
+ **`s3`** – Allows the principal to write and read query results from Amazon S3.
+ **`lakeformation`** – Allows principals to request temporary credentials to access data in a data lake location that is registered with Lake Formation. For more information, see [Underlying data access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/access-control-underlying-data.html) in the *AWS Lake Formation Developer Guide*.
