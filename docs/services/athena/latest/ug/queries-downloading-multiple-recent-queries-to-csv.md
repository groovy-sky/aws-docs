# Download multiple recent queries to a CSV file

You can use the **Recent queries** tab of the Athena console to export
one or more recent queries to a CSV file in order to view them in tabular format. The
downloaded file contains not the query results, but the SQL query string itself and
other information about the query. Exported fields include the execution ID, query
string contents, query start time, status, run time, amount of data scanned, query
engine version used, and encryption method. You can export a maximum of 500 recent
queries, or a filtered maximum of 500 queries using criteria that you enter in the
search box.
