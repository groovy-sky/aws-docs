# Configure cross-account access in Athena to Amazon S3 buckets

A common Amazon Athena scenario is granting access to users in an account different from the
bucket owner so that they can perform queries. In this case, use a bucket policy to grant
access.

###### Note

For information about cross-account access to AWS Glue data catalogs from Athena, see
[Configure cross-account access to AWS Glue data catalogs](security-iam-cross-account-glue-catalog-access.md).

The following example bucket policy, created and applied to bucket
`s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket` by the bucket owner, grants access to all users in
account `123456789123`, which is a different account.

JSON

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Id": "MyPolicyID",
   "Statement": [
      {
          "Sid": "MyStatementSid",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
             "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789123:root"
          },
          "Action": [
             "s3:GetBucketLocation",
             "s3:GetObject",
             "s3:ListBucket",
             "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
             "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
             "s3:AbortMultipartUpload"
          ],
          "Resource": [
             "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket",
             "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
          ]
       }
    ]
 }

```

To grant access to a particular user in an account, replace the `Principal` key
with a key that specifies the user instead of `root`. For example, for user
profile `Dave`, use `arn:aws:iam::123456789123:user/Dave`.

## Configure cross-account access to a bucket encrypted with a custom AWS KMS key

If you have an Amazon S3 bucket that is encrypted with a custom AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key, you
might need to grant access to it to users from another Amazon Web Services account.

Granting access to an AWS KMS-encrypted bucket in Account A to a user in Account B
requires the following permissions:

- The bucket policy in Account A must grant access to the role assumed by
Account B.

- The AWS KMS key policy in Account A must grant access to the role assumed by the
user in Account B.

- The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role assumed by Account B must grant access to both the
bucket and the key in Account A.

The following procedures describe how to grant each of these permissions.

###### To grant access to the bucket in account a to the user in account b

- From Account A, [review the S3\
bucket policy](../../../s3/latest/userguide/add-bucket-policy.md) and confirm that there is a statement that allows
access from the account ID of Account B.

For example, the following bucket policy allows `s3:GetObject`
access to the account ID `111122223333`:
JSON

```json

{
    "Id": "ExamplePolicy1",
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "ExampleStmt1",
        "Action": [
          "s3:GetObject"
        ],
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*",
        "Principal": {
          "AWS": [
            "111122223333"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
}

```

###### To grant access to the user in account b from the AWS KMS key policy in account a

1. In the AWS KMS key policy for Account A, grant the role assumed by Account B
    permissions to the following actions:

- `kms:Encrypt`

- `kms:Decrypt`

- `kms:ReEncrypt*`

- `kms:GenerateDataKey*`

- `kms:DescribeKey`

The following example grants key access to only one IAM role.
JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowUseOfTheKey",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/role_name"
            },
            "Action": [
                "kms:Encrypt",
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:ReEncrypt*",
                "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
                "kms:DescribeKey"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

2. From Account A, review the key policy [using the AWS Management Console policy view](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-modifying.md#key-policy-modifying-how-to-console-policy-view).

3. In the key policy, verify that the following statement lists Account B as a
    principal.

```json

"Sid": "Allow use of the key"
```

4. If the `"Sid": "Allow use of the key"` statement is not present,
    perform the following steps:
1. Switch to view the key policy [using the console default view](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-modifying.md#key-policy-modifying-how-to-console-default-view).

2. Add Account B's account ID as an external account with access to the
       key.

###### To grant access to the bucket and the key in account a from the IAM role assumed by account b

1. From Account B, open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. Open the IAM role associated with the user in Account B.

3. Review the list of permissions policies applied to IAM role.

4. Ensure that a policy is applied that grants access to the bucket.

The following example statement grants the IAM role access to the
    `s3:GetObject` and `s3:PutObject` operations on the
    bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`:
JSON

```json

{
     "Version":"2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "ExampleStmt2",
         "Action": [
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:PutObject"
         ],
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
       }
     ]
}

```

5. Ensure that a policy is applied that grants access to the key.

###### Note

If the IAM role assumed by Account B already has [administrator access](../../../iam/latest/userguide/getting-started-create-admin-group.md), then you don't need to grant access to
the key from the user's IAM policies.

The following example statement grants the IAM role access to use the key
    `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789098:key/111aa2bb-333c-4d44-5555-a111bb2c33dd`.
JSON

```json

{
     "Version":"2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "ExampleStmt3",
         "Action": [
           "kms:Decrypt",
           "kms:DescribeKey",
           "kms:Encrypt",
           "kms:GenerateDataKey",
           "kms:ReEncrypt*"
         ],
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789098:key/111aa2bb-333c-4d44-5555-a111bb2c33dd"
       }
     ]
}

```

## Configure cross-account access to bucket objects

Objects that are uploaded by an account (Account C) other than the bucket's owning
account (Account A) might require explicit object-level ACLs that grant read access to
the querying account (Account B). To avoid this requirement, Account C should assume a
role in Account A before it places objects in Account A's bucket. For more information,
see [How\
can I provide cross-account access to objects that are in Amazon S3\
buckets?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cross-account-access-s3).
