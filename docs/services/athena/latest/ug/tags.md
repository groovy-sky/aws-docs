# Tag Athena resources

A tag consists of a key and a value, both of which you define. When you tag an Athena
resource, you assign custom metadata to it. You can use tags to categorize your AWS
resources in different ways; for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. In Athena,
resources like workgroups, data catalogs, and capacity reservations are taggable resources.
For example, you can create a set of tags for workgroups in your account that helps you
track workgroup owners, or identify workgroups by their purpose. If you also enable the tags
as cost allocation tags in the Billing and Cost Management console, costs associated with running queries appear in
your Cost and Usage Report with that cost allocation tag. We recommend that you that you use
AWS [tagging best\
practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html) to create a consistent set of tags to meet your organization
requirements.

You can work with tags using the Athena console or the API operations.

## Tag basics

A tag is a label that you assign to an Athena resource. Each tag consists of a key and
an optional value, both of which you define.

Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources in different ways. For example, you
can define a set of tags for your account's workgroups that helps you track each
workgroup owner or purpose.

You can add tags when creating a new Athena workgroup or data catalog, or you can add,
edit, or remove tags from them. You can edit a tag in the console. To use API operations
to edit a tag, remove the old tag and add a new one. If you delete a resource, any tags
for the resource are also deleted.

Athena does not automatically assign tags to your resources. You can edit tag keys and
values, and you can remove tags from a resource at any time. You can set the value of a
tag to an empty string, but you can't set the value of a tag to null. Do not add
duplicate tag keys to the same resource. If you do, Athena issues an error message. If
you use the **TagResource** action to tag a resource using an existing
tag key, the new tag value overwrites the old value.

In IAM, you can control which users in your Amazon Web Services account have permission to
create, edit, remove, or list tags. For more information, see [Use tag-based IAM access control policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/tags-access-control.html).

For a complete list of Amazon Athena tag actions, see the API action names in the [Amazon Athena API Reference](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference.md).

You can use tags for billing. For more information, see [Using tags for billing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/custom-tags.html) in the
_AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide_.

For more information, see [Tag restrictions](#tag-restrictions).

## Tag restrictions

Tags have the following restrictions:

- In Athena, you can tag workgroups, data catalogs, and capacity reservations.
You cannot tag queries.

- The maximum number of tags per resource is 50. To stay within the limit,
review and delete unused tags.

- For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only
one value. Do not add duplicate tag keys at the same time to the same resource.
If you do, Athena issues an error message. If you tag a resource using an
existing tag key in a separate `TagResource` action, the new tag
value overwrites the old value.

- Tag key length is 1-128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

- Tag value length is 0-256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

Tagging operations, such as adding, editing, removing, or listing tags,
require that you specify an ARN for the workgroup resource.

- Athena allows you to use letters, numbers, spaces represented in UTF-8, and the
following characters: + - = . \_ : / @.

- Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

- The `"aws:"` prefix in tag keys is reserved for AWS use. You
can't edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not
count against your per-resource tags limit.

- The tags you assign are available only to your Amazon Web Services account.
