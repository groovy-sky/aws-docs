# Amazon Athena JDBC 3.x release notes
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes"></a>

These release notes provide details of improvements and fixes in the Amazon Athena JDBC 3.x driver.

## 3.8.1
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2026-08-28"></a>

Released 2026-08-28

### Improvements
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2026-08-28-improvements"></a>
+ **Security update** – This release upgrades the bundled Netty dependency from 4.1.133.Final to 4.1.135.Final, which includes security fixes. To help keep your connections to Athena secure, we recommend upgrading to this driver version.
+ **Proxy support for Amazon DataZone authentication** – The Amazon DataZone IAM and Amazon DataZone IAM Identity Center credential providers now route their network calls through the configured proxy. This resolves connection failures to Amazon DataZone and IAM Identity Center endpoints in environments where a proxy handles DNS resolution.
+ **Trusted identity propagation in AWS GovCloud (US)** – The IAM Identity Center context provider now derives its partition from the resolved access role ARN. This resolves authentication failures for trusted identity propagation in AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

## 3.8.0
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2026-06-03"></a>

Released 2026-06-03

### Improvements
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2026-06-03-improvements"></a>
+ **Multi-catalog browsing** – Added multi-catalog browsing support for lakehouse features. The driver can now discover and connect to all catalogs in federated catalog environments, enabling use of S3 Tables and catalog federation through Amazon Athena.
+ **Browser SSO OIDC authentication plugin** – Added a new authentication plugin for AWS Identity and Access Management Identity Center. This plugin enables seamless browser-based single sign-on authentication using the Authorization Code with PKCE flow. For more information, see [Browser SSO OIDC credentials](jdbc-v3-driver-browser-sso-oidc.md).
+ **SageMaker authentication** – Added support for connecting using `DataZoneProjectId` in the `SageMakerBrowserIdc` and `SageMakerIam` authentication plugins. You can now connect to your SageMaker projects and work with the data from your preferred third-party tool. For more information, see [SageMaker Browser IDC Credentials Provider](jdbc-v3-driver-datazone-idc.md) and [SageMaker IAM Credentials Provider](jdbc-v3-driver-datazone-iamcp.md).
+ **Browser authentication caching** – Added in-memory token caching support to the BrowserSaml and BrowserAzureAD authentication plugins. When `EnableTokenCaching` is set to `true`, the driver caches authentication tokens across connections, reducing the number of browser authentication prompts.
+ **AWS SDK version update** – We have updated the AWS SDK version used in the driver to 2.46.3 and have updated the project dependencies for release 3.8.0.

### Fixes
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2026-06-03-fixes"></a>
+ **Date and time handling** – The driver now correctly handles pre-Gregorian dates, daylight saving time transitions, time zone conversions, and nanosecond precision in date, time, and timestamp values.
+ **Prepared statements** – Prepared statements now work correctly when trailing line comments are present.
+ **Special characters in table names** – The `getTables` and `getColumns` methods now correctly handle table names containing special characters such as `+`, `$`, or `.`.
+ **ResultSet.getObject** – `ResultSet.getObject()` now throws `SQLException` instead of `NullPointerException` or `ClassCastException`, in compliance with the JDBC specification.
+ **OutputLocation compatibility** – The `s3_staging_dir` connection parameter from the 2.x driver is now correctly recognized as an alias for `OutputLocation`.
+ **Connection lifecycle** – The driver now properly shuts down internal thread pools when the connection is closed or when the network timeout is changed, preventing thread leaks.

## 3.7.0
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2025-11-21"></a>

Released 2025-11-21

### Improvements
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2025-11-21-improvements"></a>
+ **Browser OIDC Trusted identity propagation authentication plugin** – Added a new authentication plugin that enables seamless browser-based authentication with OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers. This plugin handles the complete OAuth 2.0 flow through your default browser, automatically fetches the JSON Web Token (JWT), and integrates with trusted identity propagation. Designed specifically for single-user desktop environments, it provides a more streamlined authentication experience compared to manual JWT handling. For more information about trusted identity propagation, see [What is trusted identity propagation?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/trustedidentitypropagation-overview.html).

### Fixes
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2025-11-21-fixes"></a>
+ **Enhanced timestamp precision support** – The driver now fully supports millisecond and nanosecond precision in timestamp values returned from Athena queries through the `getTimestamp()` method.
+ **Improved complex type handling** – Fixed issues with parsing nested data types (arrays, structs, and maps) in both `DatabaseMetaData#getColumns` and general metadata operations, ensuring accurate type information for complex data structures.
+ **Enhanced error logging** – Improved logging for S3 metadata fetch failures, providing clearer error messages and better diagnostic information.

## 3.6.0
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2025-09-10"></a>

Released 2025-09-10

### Improvements
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2025-09-10-improvements"></a>
+ **JWT Trusted identity propagation authentication plugin** – Added a new authentication plugin to support JWT trusted identity propagation integration with JDBC drivers. This authentication type allows you to use a JSON web token (JWT) obtained from an external identity provider as a connection parameter to authenticate with Athena. With trusted identity propagation, identity context is added to an IAM role to identify the user requesting access to AWS resources. For information on enabling and using trusted identity propagation, see [What is trusted identity propagation?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/trustedidentitypropagation-overview.html).
+ **Custom SSO OIDC and SSO admin endpoints support** – Added support for custom SSO OIDC and SSO Admin endpoints in the JDBC driver. This enhancement allows you to specify your own endpoints for SSO services when running JDBC behind VPCs.
+ **AWS SDK version update** – We have updated the AWS SDK version used in the driver to 2.32.16 and have updated the project dependencies for release 3.6.0.

## 3.5.1
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2025-07-17"></a>

Released 2025-07-17

### Improvements
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2025-07-17-improvements"></a>
+ **Logging capabilities** – Enhanced S3 fetch logging by elevating log level to `INFO` and adding metrics for row counts, offsets, and object length. Implemented connection lifecycle tracking and optimized overall logging performance.
+ **Special characters handling** – Improved handling of special characters for `LIKE` patterns in schema and catalog names.
+ **Connection state management** – Improved connection state management to prevent potential errors by preventing API calls after connection closure and adding safety checks for query operations during shutdown.

### Fixes
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2025-07-17-fixes"></a>
+ **DDL query metadata** – Fixed `NoSuchKeyFound` issue with DDL query metadata handling.

## 3.5.0
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2025-03-18"></a>

Released 2025-03-18

### Improvements
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2025-03-18-improvements"></a>
+ **Result configuration parameters** – Added support for two new connection parameters `ExpectedBucketOwner` and `AclOption`. For more information, see [Result configuration parameters](jdbc-v3-driver-advanced-connection-parameters.md#jdbc-v3-driver-result-config).
+ **AWS SDK version** – The AWS SDK version used in the driver has been updated to 2.30.22.

## 3.4.0
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2025-02-18"></a>

Released 2025-02-18

### Improvements
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2025-02-18-improvements"></a>
+ **Result Fetcher** – The driver now automatically selects the fastest method to download query results. This removes the need to manually configure the fetcher in most situations. For more information, see [Result fetching parameters](jdbc-v3-driver-advanced-connection-parameters.md#jdbc-v3-driver-result-fetching-parameters).

### Fixes
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2025-02-18-fixes"></a>
+ **ResultSet** – The driver now handles iterating over the result sets of DDL statements that don't produce result objects on S3. It also returns an empty `ResultSet` object instead of null when `GetQueryResultsStream` returns a completely empty page.
+ **ResultsStream** – The result streaming has been optimized by removing unnecessary calls to count the number of rows in internal buffers.
+ **getTables** – The `GetTables` call has been optimized by handling table types based on `ListTableMetadata` and `GetTableMetadata` responses.

## 3.3.0
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2024-10-30"></a>

Released 2024-10-30

### Improvements
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2024-10-30-improvements"></a>
+ **DataZone authentication** – Added support for the DataZone authentication plugins `DataZoneIdC` and `DataZoneIAM`. For more information, see [SageMaker Browser IDC Credentials Provider](jdbc-v3-driver-datazone-idc.md) and [SageMaker IAM Credentials Provider](jdbc-v3-driver-datazone-iamcp.md).
+ **Network timeout** – The network timeout can now be set using the `NetworkTimeoutMillis` connection parameter. Previously it could be set only on the `Connection` object itself. For more information, see [Network timeout](jdbc-v3-driver-other-configuration.md#jdbc-v3-driver-network-timeout).

### Fixes
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2024-10-30-fixes"></a>
+ **S3 empty object handling** – The driver now handles empty objects in the S3 fetcher instead of throwing an Amazon S3 Range Not Satisfiable exception.
+ **Logging** – The driver no longer logs the message Items requested for query execution [...], but subscription is cancelled after consuming query results.
+ **Empty parameter strings** – The driver now handles empty strings present in a connection parameter as if the parameter were not present. This resolves issues that occurred when some BI tools inadvertently passed empty strings that caused unintended authentication attempts.

## 3.2.2
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2024-07-29"></a>

Released 2024-07-29

### Improvements
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2024-07-29-improvements"></a>
+ **Data type mapping** – Improved the compliance with the JDBC spec by changing how the driver maps the `tinyint`, `smallint`, `row`, and `struct` data types to Java objects.
+ **AWS SDK version update** – The AWS SDK version used in the driver has been updated to 2.26.23.

### Fixes
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2024-07-29-fixes"></a>
+ **Comments** – Fixed an issue with line comments at the end of a statement.
+ **Database listing** – Fixed an issue in which listing databases could enter an infinite loop when the last page returned by the paginated `ListDatabases` API was empty.

## 3.2.1
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2024-07-03"></a>

Released 2024-07-03

### Improvements
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2024-07-03-improvements"></a>
+ **JWT credentials provider** – Added support for user-specified session durations. For more information, see [Role session duration](jdbc-v3-driver-jwt-credentials.md#jdbc-v3-driver-jwt-role-session-duration).

### Fixes
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2024-07-03-fixes"></a>
+ **Thread pool** – Created one `ThreadPoolExecutor` per connection for asynchronous tasks to avoid using the `ForkJoin` pool.
+ **Credential providers** – The proxy host is now parsed to get the scheme and host when the HTTP client is configured for external IdPs.
+ **Default credentials provider** – Ensured the default credentials provider can't be closed by client code.
+ **getColumns** – Fixed an `ORDINAL_COLUMN` column property issue in the `DatabaseMetaData#getColumns` method.
+ **ResultSet** – Added support for `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN` to `ResultSet.` Fixed a discrepancy between the column type returned from catalog operations and the result set of a completed query.

## 3.2.0
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2024-02-26"></a>

Released 2024-04-26

### Improvements
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2024-02-26-improvements"></a>
+ **Catalog operation performance** – Performance has been improved for catalog operations that do not use wildcard characters.
+ **Minimum polling interval change** – The minimum polling interval default has been modified to reduce the number of API calls the driver makes to Athena. Query completions are still detected as soon as possible.
+ **BI tool discoverability** – The driver has been made more easily discoverable for business intelligence tools.
+ **Data type mapping** – Data type mapping to the Athena `binary`, `array`, and `struct` DDL data types has been improved.
+ **AWS SDK version** – The AWS SDK version used in the driver has been updated to 2.25.34.

### Fixes
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2024-02-26-fixes"></a>
+ **Federated catalog table listings** – Fixed an issue that caused federated catalogs to return an empty list of tables.
+ **getSchemas** – Fixed an issue that caused the JDBC [DatabaseMetaData\#getSchemas](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/DatabaseMetaData.html#getSchemas--) method to fetch databases only from the default catalog instead of from all catalogs.
+ **getColumns** – Fixed an issue that caused a null catalog to be returned when the JDBC [DatabaseMetaData\#getColumns](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/DatabaseMetaData.html#getColumns-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) method was called with a null catalog name.

## 3.1.0
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2024-02-15"></a>

Released 2024-02-15

### Improvements
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2024-02-15-improvements"></a>
+ Support added for Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) Windows Integrated Authentication and form-based authentication.
+ For backwards compatibility with version 2.x, the `awsathena` JDBC sub-protocol is now accepted but produces a deprecation warning. Use the `athena` JDBC sub-protocol instead.
+ `AwsDataCatalog` is now the default for the catalog parameter, and `default` is the default for the database parameter. These changes ensure that correct values for the current catalog and database are returned instead of null.
+ In conformance with the JDBC specification, `IS_AUTOINCREMENT` and `IS_GENERATEDCOLUMN` now return an empty string instead of `NO`.
+ The Athena `int` data type now maps to the same JDBC type as Athena `integer` instead of to `other`.
+ When the column metadata from Athena does not contain the optional `precision` and `scale` fields, the driver now returns zero for the corresponding values in a `ResultSet` column.
+ The AWS SDK version has been updated to 2.21.39.

### Fixes
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2024-02-15-fixes"></a>
+ Fixed an issue with `GetQueryResultsStream` that caused an exception to occur when plain text results from Athena had a column count inconsistent with the column count in Athena result metadata.

## 3.0.0
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-release-notes-2023-11-16"></a>

Released 2023-11-16
