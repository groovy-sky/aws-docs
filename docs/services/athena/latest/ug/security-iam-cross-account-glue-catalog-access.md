# Configure cross-account access to AWS Glue data catalogs

You can use Athena's cross-account AWS Glue catalog feature to register an AWS Glue catalog from
an account other than your own. After you configure the required IAM permissions for AWS Glue
and register the catalog as an Athena [DataCatalog](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-datacatalog.md) resource, you can use Athena to run cross-account queries. For
information about using the Athena console to register a catalog from another account, see
[Register a Data Catalog from another account](data-sources-glue-cross-account.md).

For more information about cross-account access in AWS Glue, see [Granting cross-account access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/cross-account-access.html) in
the _AWS Glue Developer Guide_.

## Before you start

Because this feature uses existing Athena `DataCatalog` resource APIs and
functionality to enable cross-account access, we recommend that you read the following
resources before you start:

- [Connect to data sources](work-with-data-stores.md)
\- Contains topics on using Athena with AWS Glue, Hive, or Lambda data catalog
sources.

- [Data Catalog example policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/datacatalogs-example-policies.html) \- Shows how to write
policies that control access to data catalogs.

- [Use the AWS CLI with Hive metastores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/datastores-hive-cli.html) -
Shows how to use the AWS CLI with Hive metastores, but contains use cases
applicable to other data sources.

## Considerations and limitations

Currently, Athena cross-account AWS Glue catalog access has the following
limitations:

- The feature is available only in AWS Regions where Athena engine version 2 or later is
supported. For information about Athena engine versions, see [Athena engine versioning](engine-versions.md). To upgrade the
engine version for a workgroup, see [Change Athena engine versions](engine-versions-changing.md).

- When you register another account's AWS Glue Data Catalog in your account, you create a
regional `DataCatalog` resource that is linked to the other account's
data in that particular Region only.

- Currently, `CREATE VIEW` statements that include a cross-account
AWS Glue catalog are not supported.

- Catalogs encrypted using AWS managed keys cannot be queried across accounts.
For catalogs that you want to query across accounts, use customer managed keys
( `KMS_CMK`) instead. For information about the differences
between customer managed keys and AWS managed keys, see [Customer keys and AWS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-mgmt) in the
_AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

## Get started

In the following scenario, the "borrower" account (666666666666) wants to run a
`SELECT` query that refers to the AWS Glue catalog that belongs to the
"owner" account (999999999999), as in the following example:

```sql

SELECT * FROM ownerCatalog.tpch1000.customer
```

In the following procedure, Steps 1a and 1b show how to give the borrower account
access to the owner account's AWS Glue resources, from both the borrower and owner's side.
The example grants access to the database `tpch1000` and the table
`customer`. Change these example names to fit your requirements.

### Step 1a: Create a borrower role with a policy to access the owner's AWS Glue resources

To create borrower account role with a policy to access to the owner account's
AWS Glue resources, you can use the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) console or the [IAM\
API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html). The following procedures use the IAM console.

###### To create a borrower role and policy to access the owner account's AWS Glue resources

01. Sign in to the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam) from the borrower
     account.

02. In the navigation pane, expand **Access management**, and
     then choose **Policies**.

03. Choose **Create policy**.

04. For **Policy editor**, choose
     **JSON**.

05. In the policy editor, enter the following policy, and then modify it
     according to your requirements:
    JSON

    ```json

    {
        "Version":"2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "glue:*",
                "Resource": [
                    "arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:999999999999:catalog",
                    "arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:999999999999:database/tpch1000",
                    "arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:999999999999:table/tpch1000/customer"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

    ```

06. Choose **Next**.

07. On the **Review and create** page, for **Policy**
    **name**, enter a name for the policy (for example,
     `CrossGluePolicyForBorrowerRole`).

08. Choose **Create policy**.

09. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**.

10. Choose **Create role**.

11. On the **Select trusted entity** page, choose
     **AWS account**, and then choose
     **Next**.

12. On the **Add permissions** page, enter the name of the
     policy that you created into the search box (for example,
     `CrossGluePolicyForBorrowerRole`).

13. Select the check box next to the policy name, and then choose
     **Next**.

14. On the **Name, review, and create** page, for
     **Role name**, enter a name for the role (for example,
     `CrossGlueBorrowerRole`).

15. Choose **Create role**.

### Step 1b: Create an owner policy to grant AWS Glue access to the borrower

To grant AWS Glue access from the owner account (999999999999) to the borrower's
role, you can use the AWS Glue console or the AWS Glue [PutResourcePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/webapi/API_PutResourcePolicy.html)
API operation. The following procedure uses the AWS Glue console.

###### To grant AWS Glue access to the borrower account from the owner

1. Sign in to the AWS Glue console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue) from the owner
    account.

2. In the navigation pane, expand **Data Catalog**, and then
    choose **Catalog settings**.

3. In the **Permissions** box, enter a policy like the
    following. For `rolename`, enter the role that the
    borrower created in Step 1a (for example,
    `CrossGlueBorrowerRole`). If you want to increase
    the permission scope, you can use the wild card character `*` for
    both the database and table resource types.
JSON

```json

{
       "Version":"2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "AWS": [
                       "arn:aws:iam::666666666666:user/username",
                       "arn:aws:iam::666666666666:role/rolename"
                   ]
               },
               "Action": "glue:*",
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:999999999999:catalog",
                   "arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:999999999999:database/tpch1000",
                   "arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:999999999999:table/tpch1000/customer"
               ]
           }
       ]
}

```

After you finish, we recommend that you use the [AWS Glue API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-api.html) to make some test
cross-account calls to confirm that permissions are configured as you expect.

### Step 2: The borrower registers the AWS Glue Data Catalog that belongs to the owner account

The following procedure shows you how to use the Athena console to configure the
AWS Glue Data Catalog in the owner Amazon Web Services account as a data source. For information about
using API operations instead of the console to register the catalog, see [(Optional) Use the API to register an Athena Data Catalog that belongs to the owner account](#security-iam-cross-account-glue-catalog-access-step-2-api).

###### To register an AWS Glue Data Catalog belonging to another account

01. Open the Athena console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

02. If the console navigation pane is not visible, choose the expansion menu
     on the left.

    ![Choose the expansion menu.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/nav-pane-expansion.png)

03. Expand **Administration**, and then choose **Data**
    **sources**.

04. On the upper right, choose **Create data source**.

05. On the **Choose a data source** page, for **Data**
    **sources**, select **S3 - AWS Glue Data Catalog**, and
     then choose **Next**.

06. On the **Enter data source details** page, in the
     **AWS Glue Data Catalog** section, for **Choose an**
    **AWS Glue Data Catalog**, choose **AWS Glue Data Catalog in another**
    **account**.

07. For **Data source details**, enter the following
     information:

- **Data source name** – Enter the name that
you want to use in your SQL queries to refer to the data catalog in
the other account.

- **Description** – (Optional) Enter a
description of the data catalog in the other account.

- **Catalog ID** – Enter the 12-digit
Amazon Web Services account ID of the account to which the data catalog
belongs. The Amazon Web Services account ID is the catalog ID.

08. (Optional) Expand **Tags**, and then enter key-value
     pairs that you want to associate with the data source. For more information
     about tags, see [Tag Athena resources](tags.md).

09. Choose **Next**.

10. On the **Review and create** page, review the information
     that you provided, and then choose **Create data source**.
     The **Data source details** page lists the databases and
     tags for the data catalog that you registered.

11. Choose **Data sources and catalogs**. The data catalog that you
     registered is listed in the **Data source name**
     column.

12. To view or edit information about the data catalog, choose the catalog,
     and then choose **Actions**,
     **Edit**.

13. To delete the new data catalog, choose the catalog, and then choose
     **Actions**, **Delete**.

### Step 3: The borrower submits a query

The borrower submits a query that references the catalog using the
`catalog`. `database`. `table`
syntax, as in the following example:

```sql

SELECT * FROM ownerCatalog.tpch1000.customer
```

Instead of using the fully qualified syntax, the borrower can also specify the
catalog contextually by passing it in through the [QueryExecutionContext](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_QueryExecutionContext.html).

## (Optional) Configure additional Amazon S3 permissions

- If the borrower account uses an Athena query to write new data to a table in
the owner account, the owner will not automatically have access to this data in
Amazon S3, even though the table exists in the owner's account. This is because the
borrower is the object owner of the information in Amazon S3 unless otherwise
configured. To grant the owner access to the data, set the permissions on the
objects accordingly as an additional step.

- Certain cross-account DDL operations like [MSCK REPAIR TABLE](msck-repair-table.md) require Amazon S3 permissions. For example,
if the borrower account is performing a cross-account `MSCK REPAIR`
operation against a table in the owner account that has its data in an owner
account S3 bucket, that bucket must grant permissions to the role assumed by the
borrower for the query to succeed.

For information about granting bucket permissions, see [How do I set ACL bucket\
permissions?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/set-bucket-permissions.html) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

## (Optional) Use a catalog dynamically

In some cases you might want to quickly perform testing against a cross-account AWS Glue
catalog without the prerequisite step of registering it. You can dynamically perform
cross-account queries without creating the `DataCatalog` resource object if
the required IAM and Amazon S3 permissions are correctly configured as described earlier in
this document.

To explicitly reference a catalog without registration, use the syntax in the
following example:

```sql

SELECT * FROM "glue:arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:999999999999:catalog".tpch1000.customer
```

Use the format " `glue:<arn>`", where
`<arn>` is the [AWS Glue Data Catalog ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/glue-specifying-resource-arns.html#data-catalog-resource-arns) that you want to use. In the example, Athena uses this
syntax to dynamically point to account 999999999999's AWS Glue data catalog as if you had
separately created a `DataCatalog` object for it.

### Notes for using dynamic catalogs

When you use dynamic catalogs, remember the following points.

- Use of a dynamic catalog requires the IAM permissions that you normally
use for Athena Data Catalog API operations. The main difference is that the
Data Catalog resource name follows the `glue:*` naming
convention.

- The catalog ARN must belong to the same Region where the query is being
run.

- When using a dynamic catalog in a DML query or view, surround it with
escaped double quotation marks ( `\"`). When using a dynamic
catalog in a DDL query, surround it with backtick characters
( `` ` ``).

## (Optional) Use the API to register an Athena Data Catalog that belongs to the owner account

Instead of using the Athena console as described in Step 2, it is possible to use API
operations to register the Data Catalog that belongs to the owner account.

The creator of the Athena [DataCatalog](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-datacatalog.md) resource
must have the necessary permissions to run the Athena [CreateDataCatalog](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-createdatacatalog.md) API operation. Depending on your requirements, access to
additional API operations might be necessary. For more information, see [Data Catalog example policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/datacatalogs-example-policies.html).

The following `CreateDataCatalog` request body registers an AWS Glue catalog
for cross-account access:

```json

# Example CreateDataCatalog request to register a cross-account Glue catalog:
{
    "Description": "Cross-account Glue catalog",
    "Name": "ownerCatalog",
    "Parameters": {"catalog-id" : "999999999999"  # Owner's account ID
    },
    "Type": "GLUE"
}
```

The following sample code uses a Java client to create the `DataCatalog`
object.

```java

# Sample code to create the DataCatalog through Java client
CreateDataCatalogRequest request = new CreateDataCatalogRequest()
    .withName("ownerCatalog")
    .withType(DataCatalogType.GLUE)
    .withParameters(ImmutableMap.of("catalog-id", "999999999999"));

athenaClient.createDataCatalog(request);
```

After these steps, the borrower should see `ownerCatalog` when it calls the
[ListDataCatalogs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_ListDataCatalogs.html)
API operation.
