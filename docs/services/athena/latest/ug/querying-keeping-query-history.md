# Keep your query history longer than 45 days

If you want to keep the query history longer than 45 days, you can retrieve the query
history and save it to a data store such as Amazon S3. To automate this process, you can use
Athena and Amazon S3 API actions and CLI commands. The following procedure summarizes these
steps.

###### To retrieve and save query history programmatically

1. Use Athena [ListQueryExecutions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_ListQueryExecutions.html) API action or the [list-query-executions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/athena/list-query-executions.html) CLI command to retrieve the query IDs.

2. Use the Athena [GetQueryExecution](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-getqueryexecution.md) API action or the [get-query-execution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/athena/get-query-execution.html) CLI command to retrieve information about each
    query based on its ID.

3. Use the Amazon S3 [PutObject](../../../s3/latest/api/api-putobject.md) API
    action or the [put-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/put-object.html) CLI command to save the information in Amazon S3.
