# Configure cross-account AWS Glue access in Athena for Spark
<a name="spark-notebooks-cross-account-glue"></a>

This topic shows how consumer account {{666666666666}} and owner account {{999999999999}} can be configured for cross-account AWS Glue access. When the accounts are configured, the consumer account can run queries from Athena for Spark on the owner's AWS Glue databases and tables.

## Step 1: In AWS Glue, provide access to consumer roles
<a name="spark-notebooks-cross-account-glue-in-aws-glue-provide-access-to-the-consumer-account"></a>

In AWS Glue, the owner creates a policy that provides the consumer's roles access to the owner's AWS Glue data catalog.

**To add a AWS Glue policy that allows a consumer role access to the owner's data catalog**

1. Using the catalog owner's account, sign in to the AWS Management Console.

1. Open the AWS Glue console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/).

1. In the navigation pane, expand **Data Catalog**, and then choose **Catalog settings**.

1. On the **Data catalog settings** page, in the **Permissions** section, add a policy like the following. This policy provides roles for the consumer account {{666666666666}} access to the data catalog in the owner account {{999999999999}}.

               "Principal": {
                   "AWS": [
                       "arn:aws:iam::{{666666666666}}:role/Admin",
                       "arn:aws:iam::{{666666666666}}:role/AWSAthenaSparkExecutionRole"
                   ]
               },
               "Action": "glue:*",
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:glue:us-west-2:{{999999999999}}:catalog",
                   "arn:aws:glue:us-west-2:{{999999999999}}:database/*",
                   "arn:aws:glue:us-west-2:{{999999999999}}:table/*"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

## Step 2: Configure the consumer account for access
<a name="spark-notebooks-cross-account-glue-configure-the-consumer-account-for-access"></a>

In the consumer account, create a policy to allow access to the owner's AWS Glue Data Catalog, databases, and tables, and attach the policy to a role. The following example uses consumer account {{666666666666}}.

**To create a AWS Glue policy for access to the owner's AWS Glue Data Catalog**

1. Using the consumer account, sign into the AWS Management Console.

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).

1. In the navigation pane, expand **Access management**, and then choose **Policies**.

1. Choose **Create policy**.

1. On the **Specify permissions** page, choose **JSON**.

1. In the **Policy editor**, enter a JSON statement like the following that allows AWS Glue actions on the owner account's data catalog.

   ```
   {
       "Version":"2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "glue:*",
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:{{999999999999}}:catalog",
                   "arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:{{999999999999}}:database/*",
                   "arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:{{999999999999}}:table/*"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

------

1. Choose **Next**.

1. On the **Review and create** page, for **Policy name**, enter a name for the policy.

1. Choose **Create policy**.

Next, you use IAM console in the consumer account to attach the policy that you just created to the IAM role or roles that the consumer account will use to access the owner's data catalog.

**To attach the AWS Glue policy to the roles in the consumer account**

1. In the consumer account IAM console navigation pane, choose **Roles**.

1. On the **Roles** page, find the role that you want to attach the policy to.

1. Choose **Add permissions**, and then choose **Attach policies**.

1. Find the policy that you just created.

1. Select the check box for the policy, and then choose **Add permissions**.

1. Repeat the steps to add the policy to other roles that you want to use.

## Step 3: Configure a session and create a query
<a name="spark-notebooks-cross-account-glue-configure-a-session-and-create-a-query"></a>

In Athena Spark, in the requester account, using the role specified, create a session to test access by [creating a notebook](notebooks-spark-getting-started.md#notebooks-spark-getting-started-creating-your-own-notebook) or [editing a current session](notebooks-spark-getting-started.md#notebooks-spark-getting-started-editing-session-details). When you [configure the session properties](notebooks-spark-custom-jar-cfg.md#notebooks-spark-custom-jar-cfg-console), specify one of the following:
+ **The AWS Glue catalog separator** – With this approach, you include the owner account ID in your queries. Use this method if you are going to use the session to query data catalogs from different owners.
+ **The AWS Glue catalog ID** – With this approach, you query the database directly. This method is more convenient if you are going to use the session to query only a single owner's data catalog.

### Use the AWS Glue catalog separator
<a name="spark-notebooks-cross-account-glue-using-the-glue-catalog-separator-approach"></a>

When you edit the session properties, add the following:

```
{
    "spark.hadoop.aws.glue.catalog.separator": "/"
}
```

When you run a query in a cell, use syntax like that in the following example. Note that in the `FROM` clause, the catalog ID and separator are required before the database name.

```
df = spark.sql('SELECT requestip, uri, method, status FROM `{{999999999999}}/mydatabase`.cloudfront_logs LIMIT 5')
df.show()
```

### Use the AWS Glue catalog ID
<a name="spark-notebooks-cross-account-glue-using-the-glue-catalog-id-approach"></a>

When you edit the session properties, enter the following property. Replace {{999999999999}} with the owner account ID.

```
{
    "spark.hadoop.hive.metastore.glue.catalogid": "{{999999999999}}"
}
```

When you run a query in a cell, use syntax like the following. Note that in the `FROM` clause, the catalog ID and separator are not required before the database name.

```
df = spark.sql('SELECT * FROM mydatabase.cloudfront_logs LIMIT 10')
df.show()
```
