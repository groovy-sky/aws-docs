# Escape reserved keywords in queries

When you run queries in Athena that include reserved keywords, you must escape them by
enclosing them in special characters. Use the lists in this topic to check which keywords
are reserved in Athena.

To escape reserved keywords in DDL statements, enclose them in backticks (\`). To escape
reserved keywords in SQL `SELECT` statements and in queries on [views](views.md), enclose them in double quotes
('').

## Reserved keywords to escape in DDL statements

Athena uses the following list of reserved keywords in its DDL statements. If you use
them without escaping them, Athena issues an error. To escape them, enclose them in
backticks (\`).

You cannot use DDL reserved keywords as identifier names in DDL statements without
enclosing them in backticks (\`).

## Reserved keywords to escape in SQL SELECT statements

Athena uses the following list of reserved keywords in SQL `SELECT`
statements and in queries on views.

If you use these keywords as identifiers, you must enclose them in double quotes (")
in your query statements.

ALTER, AND, AS, BETWEEN, BY, CASE, CAST, CONSTRAINT, CREATE,
CROSS, CUBE, CURRENT_CATALOG, CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_PATH,
CURRENT_SCHEMA, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_USER,

## Examples of queries with reserved words

The query in the following example uses backticks (\`) to escape the DDL-related
reserved keywords _partition_ and _date_ that are
used for a table name and one of the column names:

```sql

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE `partition` (
`date` INT,
col2 STRING
)
PARTITIONED BY (year STRING)
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION 's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test_examples/';

```

The following example queries include a column name containing the DDL-related
reserved keywords in `ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION` and `ALTER TABLE DROP
                PARTITION` statements. The DDL reserved keywords are enclosed in backticks
(\`):

```sql

ALTER TABLE test_table
ADD PARTITION (`date` = '2018-05-14')
```

```sql

ALTER TABLE test_table
DROP PARTITION (`partition` = 'test_partition_value')
```

The following example query includes a reserved keyword (end) as an identifier in a
`SELECT` statement. The keyword is escaped in double quotes:

```sql

SELECT *
FROM TestTable
WHERE "end" != nil;
```

The following example query includes a reserved keyword (first) in a
`SELECT` statement. The keyword is escaped in double quotes:

```

SELECT "itemId"."first"
FROM testTable
LIMIT 10;

```
