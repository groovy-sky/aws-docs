# Configure SSO for ODBC using the Okta plugin and Okta Identity Provider

This page describes how to configure the Amazon Athena ODBC driver and Okta plugin to add
single sign-on (SSO) capability using the Okta identity provider.

## Prerequisites

Completing the steps in this tutorial requires the following:

- Amazon Athena ODBC driver. For download links, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with ODBC](connect-with-odbc.md).

- An IAM Role that you want to use with SAML. For more information, see [Creating a role\
for SAML 2.0 federation](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-idp-saml.md) in the _IAM User_
_Guide_.

- An Okta account. For information, visit [Okta.com](https://www.okta.com/).

## Creating an app integration in Okta

First, use the Okta dashboard to create and configure a SAML 2.0 app for single
sign-on to Athena. You can use an existing Redshift application in Okta to configure
access to Athena.

###### To create an app integration in Okta

01. Log in to the admin page for your account on [Okta.com](https://www.okta.com/).

02. In the navigation panel, choose **Applications**,
     **Applications.**

03. On the **Applications** page, choose **Browse App**
    **Catalog.**

04. On the **Browse App Integration Catalog** page, in the
     **Use Case** section, choose **All**
    **Integrations**.

05. In the search box, enter **Amazon Web Services Redshift**, and then
     choose **Amazon Web Services Redshift SAML**.

06. Choose **Add Integration**.

    ![Choose Add integration.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-okta-plugin-1.png)

07. In the **General Settings Required** section, for
     **Application label**, enter a name for the application.
     This tutorial uses the name **Athena-ODBC-Okta.**

The **DbUser Format**, **AutoCreate**, and
**Allowed DBGroups** settings aren't used by Athena. You
don't have to configure them.

12. Choose **Save**.

## Retrieve ODBC configuration information from Okta

Now that you created the Okta application, you're ready to retrieve the application's
ID and IdP host URL. You will require these later when you configure ODBC for connection
to Athena.

###### To retrieve configuration information for ODBC from Okta

1. Choose the **General** tab of your Okta application, and then
    scroll down to the **App Embed Link** section.

![The embed link URL of the Okta application.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-okta-plugin-6.png)

Your **Embed Link** URL is in the following format:

```nohighlight

https://trial-1234567.okta.com/home/amazon_aws_redshift/Abc1de2fghi3J45kL678/abc1defghij2klmNo3p4
```

2. From your **Embed Link** URL, extract and save the following
    pieces:

- The first segment after `https://`, up to and including
`okta.com` (for example,
**trial-1234567.okta.com**). This is your IdP
host.

- The last two segments of the URL, including the forward slash in the
middle. The segments are two 20-character strings with a mix of numbers
and upper and lowercase letters (for example,
**Abc1de2fghi3J45kL678/abc1defghij2klmNo3p4**).
This is your application ID.

## Add a user to the Okta application

Now you're ready to add a user to your Okta application.

###### To add a user to the Okta application

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Directory**, and then
    choose **People**.
