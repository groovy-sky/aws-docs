# Browser based with identity center integration
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-browser-oidc-tip-credentials"></a>

This authentication type allows you to fetch a new JSON web token (JWT) from an external identity provider and authenticate with Athena. You can use this plugin, to enable support for corporate identities via trusted identity propagation. For more information on how to use trusted identity propagation with drivers, see [Use Trusted identity propagation with Amazon Athena drivers](using-trusted-identity-propagation.md). You can also [configure and deploy resources using CloudFormation](using-trusted-identity-propagation-cloudformation.md).

With trusted identity propagation, identity context is added to an IAM role to identify the user requesting access to AWS resources. For information on enabling and using trusted identity propagation, see [What is trusted identity propagation?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/trustedidentitypropagation.html).

**Note**
The plugin is specifically designed for single-user desktop environments. In shared environments like Windows Server, system administrators are responsible for establishing and maintaining security boundaries between users.

## Credentials provider
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-browser-oidc-tip-credentials-provider"></a>

The credentials provider that will be used to authenticate requests to AWS. Set the value of this parameter to `BrowserOidcTip`.

| Parameter name | Alias | Parameter type | Default value | Value to use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CredentialsProvider | AWSCredentialsProviderClass (deprecated) | Required | none | BrowserOidcTip |

## Idp well known configuration URL
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-browser-oidc-tip-idp-well-known-config"></a>

The IDP Well Known Configuration URL is the endpoint that provides OpenID Connect configuration details for your identity provider. This URL typically ends with `.well-known/openid-configuration` and contains essential metadata about the authentication endpoints, supported features, and token signing keys. For example, if you're using *Okta*, the URL might look like `https://your-domain.okta.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

For troubleshooting: If you receive connection errors, verify that this URL is accessible from your network and returns valid *OpenID Connect* configuration JSON. The URL must be reachable by the client where the driver is installed and should be provided by your identity provider administrator.

| Parameter name | Alias | Parameter type | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IdpWellKnownConfigurationUrl | none | Required | none |

## Client identifier
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-browser-oidc-tip-client-id"></a>

The client identifier issued to the application by the OpenID Connect provider.

| Parameter name | Alias | Parameter type | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OidcClientId | none | Required | none |

## WorkgroupArn
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-browser-oidc-tip-workgroup-arn"></a>

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Athena workgroup that contains the trusted identity propagation configuration tags. For more information about workgroups, see [WorkGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_WorkGroup.html).

**Note**
This parameter is different from the `Workgroup` parameter that specifies where queries will run. You must set both parameters:
`WorkgroupArn` - Points to the workgroup containing the trusted identity propagation configuration tags
`Workgroup` - Specifies the workgroup where queries will execute
While these typically reference the same workgroup, both parameters must be set explicitly for proper operation.

| Parameter name | Alias | Parameter type | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WorkGroupArn | none | Required | primary |

## JWT application role ARN
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-browser-oidc-tip-application-role-arn"></a>

The ARN of the role that will be assumed in the JWT exchange. This role is used for JWT exchange, getting IAM Identity Center customer managed application ARN through workgroup tags, and getting access role ARN. For more information about assuming roles, see [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html).

| Parameter name | Alias | Parameter type | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ApplicationRoleArn | none | Required | none |

## JWT role session name
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-browser-oidc-tip-role-session-name"></a>

A name for the IAM session. It can be anything you like, but typically you pass the name or identifier that's associated with the user who is using your application. That way, the temporary security credentials that your application will use are associated with that user.

| Parameter name | Alias | Parameter type | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JwtRoleSessionName | role\_session\_name (deprecated) | Required | none |

## Client secret
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-browser-oidc-tip-client-secret"></a>

The clientSecret is a confidential key issued by your identity provider that is used to authenticate your application (client). While this parameter is optional and may not be required for all authentication flows, it provides an additional layer of security when used. If your IDP configuration requires a client secret, you must include this parameter with the value provided by your identity provider administrator.

| Parameter name | Alias | Parameter type | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OidcClientSecret | none | Optional | none |

## Scope
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-browser-oidc-tip-scope"></a>

The scope specifies what level of access your application is requesting from the identity provider. You must include `openid` in the scope to receive an ID token containing essential user identity claims. Your scope may need to include additional permissions like `email` or `profile`, depending on which user claims your identity provider (such as *Microsoft Entra ID*) is configured to include in the ID token. These claims are essential for proper *Trusted Identity Propagation* mapping. If user identity mapping fails, verify that your scope includes all necessary permissions and your identity provider is configured to include the required claims in the ID token. These claims must match your *Trusted Token Issuer* mapping configuration in IAM Identity Center.

| Parameter name | Alias | Parameter type | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | none | Optional | openid email offline\_access |

## Role session duration
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-browser-oidc-tip-role-session-duration"></a>

The duration, in seconds, of the role session. For more information, see [AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html).

| Parameter name | Alias | Parameter type | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RoleSessionDuration | Duration (deprecated) | Optional | 3600 |

## JWT access role ARN
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-browser-oidc-tip-access-role-arn"></a>

The ARN of the role that Athena assumes to make calls on the behalf of you. For more information about assuming roles, see [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) in the *AWS Security Token Service API Reference*.

| Parameter name | Alias | Parameter type | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AccessRoleArn | none | Optional | none |

## IAM Identity Center customer managed application ARN
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-browser-oidc-tip-customer-idc-application-arn"></a>

The ARN of IAM Identity Center customer managed application. For more information, see [customer managed applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/customermanagedapps.html).

| Parameter name | Alias | Parameter type | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CustomerIdcApplicationArn | none | Optional | none |

## Identity provider port number
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-browser-oidc-tip-idp-port-number"></a>

The local port number to use for the OAuth 2.0 callback server. This is used as redirect\_uri and you will need to allowlist this in your IDP application. The default generated redirect\_uri is: http://localhost:7890/athena

**Warning**
In shared environments like Windows Terminal Servers or Remote Desktop Services, the loopback port (default: 7890) is shared among all users on the same machine. System administrators can mitigate potential port hijacking risks by:
Configuring different port numbers for different user groups
Using Windows security policies to restrict port access
Implementing network isolation between user sessions
If these security controls cannot be implemented, we recommend using the [JWT trusted identity propagation](jdbc-v3-driver-jwt-tip-credentials.md) plugin instead, which doesn't require a loopback port.

| Parameter name | Alias | Parameter type | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IdpPortNumber | none | Optional | 7890 |

## Identity provider response timeout
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-browser-oidc-tip-idp-response-timeout"></a>

The timeout in seconds to wait for the OAuth 2.0 callback response.

| Parameter name | Alias | Parameter type | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IdpResponseTimeout | none | Optional | 120 |

## Enable token caching
<a name="jdbc-v3-driver-browser-oidc-tip-enable-token-caching"></a>

The EnableTokenCaching parameter determines whether the driver caches the authentication token between conections. Setting EnableTokenCaching to true reduces authentication prompts and improves user experience, but should be used cautiously. This setting is best suited for single-user desktop environments. In shared environments like Windows Server, it's recommended to keep this disabled to prevent potential token sharing between users with similar connection strings.

For enterprise deployments using tools like Tableau Server, we recommend using the [JWT trusted identity propagation](jdbc-v3-driver-jwt-tip-credentials.md) plugin instead of this authentication method.

| Parameter name | Alias | Parameter type | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EnableTokenCaching | none | Optional | FALSE |
