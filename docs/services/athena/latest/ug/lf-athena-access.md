# How Athena accesses data registered with Lake Formation

The access workflow described in this section applies when you run Athena queries on
Amazon S3 locations, data catalogs, or metadata objects that are registered with Lake Formation. For
more information, see [Registering a\
data lake](../../../lake-formation/latest/dg/register-data-lake.md) in the _AWS Lake Formation Developer Guide_. In addition to
registering data, the Lake Formation administrator applies Lake Formation permissions that grant or revoke
access to metadata in the data catalog, AWS Glue Data Catalog, or the data location in Amazon S3. For
more information, see [Security and access control to metadata and data](../../../lake-formation/latest/dg/security-data-access.md#security-data-access-permissions) in the
_AWS Lake Formation Developer Guide_.

Each time an Athena principal (user, group, or role) runs a query on data registered
using Lake Formation, Lake Formation verifies that the principal has the appropriate Lake Formation permissions to the
database, table, and data source location as appropriate for the query. If the principal
has access, Lake Formation _vends_ temporary credentials to Athena, and the
query runs.

The following diagram shows how credential vending works in Athena on a query-by-query
basis for a hypothetical `SELECT` query on a table with an Amazon S3 location or
data catalog registered in Lake Formation:

1. A principal runs a `SELECT` query in Athena.

2. Athena analyzes the query and checks Lake Formation permissions to see if the principal
    has been granted access to the table and table columns.

3. If the principal has access, Athena requests credentials from Lake Formation. If the
    principal _does not_ have access, Athena issues an access
    denied error.

4. Lake Formation issues credentials to Athena to use when reading data from Amazon S3 or
    catalog, along with the list of allowed columns.

5. Athena uses the Lake Formation temporary credentials to query the data from Amazon S3 or
    catalog. After the query completes, Athena discards the credentials.
