# OpenX JSON SerDe

Like the Hive JSON SerDe, you can use the OpenX JSON to process JSON data. The data are
also represented as single-line strings of JSON-encoded text separated by a new line. Like
the Hive JSON SerDe, the OpenX JSON SerDe does not allow duplicate keys in `map`
or `struct` key names.

## Considerations and limitations

- When using the OpenX JSON SerDe, the number of results and their values can be
non-deterministic. The results can contain more rows than expected, fewer rows
than expected, or unexpected null values when none are present in the underlying
data. To work around this issue, use the [Hive JSON SerDe](hive-json-serde.md), or rewrite the data to another file
format type.

- The SerDe expects each JSON document to be on a single line of text with no
line termination characters separating the fields in the record. If the JSON
text is in pretty print format, you may receive an error message like
**`HIVE_CURSOR_ERROR: Row is not a valid JSON Object`** or
**`HIVE_CURSOR_ERROR: JsonParseException: Unexpected end-of-input:**
**expected close marker for OBJECT`** when you attempt to query the
table after you create it.

For more information, see [JSON Data\
Files](https://github.com/rcongiu/Hive-JSON-Serde) in the OpenX SerDe documentation on GitHub.

## Optional properties

Unlike the Hive JSON SerDe, the OpenX JSON SerDe also has the following optional SerDe
properties that can be useful for addressing inconsistencies in data.

**use.null.for.invalid.data**

Optional. The default is `FALSE`. When set to
`TRUE`, the SerDe uses `NULL` for column values that
failed deserializing into the column’s type defined from table
schema.

###### Important

Setting `use.null.for.invalid.data` to `TRUE` can cause
incorrect or unexpected results because `NULL` values replace invalid
data in columns with schema mismatches. We recommend that you fix the data in your files or table
schema rather than enabling this property. When you enable this property,
queries will not fail on invalid data, which may prevent you from discovering
data quality issues.

**ignore.malformed.json**

Optional. When set to `TRUE`, lets you skip malformed JSON
syntax. The default is `FALSE`.

**dots.in.keys**

Optional. The default is `FALSE`. When set to
`TRUE`, allows the SerDe to replace the dots in key names with
underscores. For example, if the JSON dataset contains a key with the name
`"a.b"`, you can use this property to define the column name
to be `"a_b"` in Athena. By default (without this SerDe), Athena
does not allow dots in column names.

**case.insensitive**

Optional. The default is `TRUE`. When set to `TRUE`,
the SerDe converts all uppercase columns to lowercase.

To use case-sensitive key names in your data, use `WITH
                            SERDEPROPERTIES ("case.insensitive"= FALSE;)`. Then, for every key
that is not already all lowercase, provide a mapping from the column name to
the property name using the following syntax:

```sql

ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ("case.insensitive" = "FALSE", "mapping.userid" = "userId")
```

If you have two keys like `URL` and `Url` that are
the same when they are in lowercase, an error like the following can
occur:

**`HIVE_CURSOR_ERROR: Row is not a valid JSON Object -**
**JSONException: Duplicate key "url"`**

To resolve this, set the `case.insensitive` property to
`FALSE` and map the keys to different names, as in the
following example:

```sql

ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ("case.insensitive" = "FALSE", "mapping.url1" = "URL", "mapping.url2" = "Url")
```

**mapping**

Optional. Maps column names to JSON keys that aren't identical to the
column names. The `mapping` parameter is useful when the JSON
data contains keys that are [keywords](reserved-words.md).
For example, if you have a JSON key named `timestamp`, use the
following syntax to map the key to a column named `ts`:

```sql

ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ("mapping.ts" = "timestamp")
```

###### Mapping nested field names with colons to Hive-compatible names

If you have a field name with colons inside a `struct`, you
can use the `mapping` property to map the field to a
Hive-compatible name. For example, if your column type definitions
contain `my:struct:field:string`, you can map the definition
to `my_struct_field:string` by including the following entry
in `WITH SERDEPROPERTIES`:

```sql

("mapping.my_struct_field" = "my:struct:field")
```

The following example shows the corresponding `CREATE TABLE`
statement.

```sql

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE colon_nested_field (
item struct<my_struct_field:string>)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ("mapping.my_struct_field" = "my:struct:field")
```

## Example: advertising data

The following example DDL statement uses the OpenX JSON SerDe to create a table based
on the same sample online advertising data used in the example for the Hive JSON SerDe.
In the `LOCATION` clause, replace `myregion` with
the region identifier where you run Athena.

```sql

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE impressions (
    requestbegintime string,
    adid string,
    impressionId string,
    referrer string,
    useragent string,
    usercookie string,
    ip string,
    number string,
    processid string,
    browsercokie string,
    requestendtime string,
    timers struct<
       modellookup:string,
       requesttime:string>,
    threadid string,
    hostname string,
    sessionid string
)   PARTITIONED BY (dt string)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
LOCATION 's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.elasticmapreduce/samples/hive-ads/tables/impressions';
```

## Example: deserializing nested JSON

You can use the JSON SerDes to parse more complex JSON-encoded data. This requires
using `CREATE TABLE` statements that use `struct` and
`array` elements to represent nested structures.

The following example creates an Athena table from JSON data that has nested
structures. The example has the following structure:

```json

{
"DocId": "AWS",
"User": {
        "Id": 1234,
        "Username": "carlos_salazar",
        "Name": "Carlos",
"ShippingAddress": {
"Address1": "123 Main St.",
"Address2": null,
"City": "Anytown",
"State": "CA"
   },
"Orders": [
   {
     "ItemId": 6789,
     "OrderDate": "11/11/2022"
   },
   {
     "ItemId": 4352,
     "OrderDate": "12/12/2022"
   }
  ]
 }
}

```

Remember that the OpenX SerDe expects each JSON record to be on a single line of text.
When stored in Amazon S3, all of the data in the preceding example should be on a single
line, like this:

```nohighlight

{"DocId":"AWS","User":{"Id":1234,"Username":"carlos_salazar","Name":"Carlos","ShippingAddress" ...
```

The following `CREATE TABLE` statement uses the [Openx-JsonSerDe](https://github.com/rcongiu/Hive-JSON-Serde) with the
`struct` and `array` collection data types to establish groups
of objects for the example data.

```sql

CREATE external TABLE complex_json (
   docid string,
   `user` struct<
               id:INT,
               username:string,
               name:string,
               shippingaddress:struct<
                                      address1:string,
                                      address2:string,
                                      city:string,
                                      state:string
                                      >,
               orders:array<
                            struct<
                                 itemid:INT,
                                  orderdate:string
                                  >
                              >
               >
   )
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
LOCATION 's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/myjsondata/';
```

To query the table, use a `SELECT` statement like the following.

```sql

SELECT
 user.name as Name,
 user.shippingaddress.address1 as Address,
 user.shippingaddress.city as City,
 o.itemid as Item_ID, o.orderdate as Order_date
FROM complex_json, UNNEST(user.orders) as temp_table (o)
```

To access the data fields inside structs, the sample query uses dot notation (for
example, `user.name`). To access data inside an array of structs (as with the
`orders` field), you can use the `UNNEST` function. The
`UNNEST` function flattens the array into a temporary table (in this case
called `o`). This lets you use the dot notation as you do with structs to
access the unnested array elements (for example, `o.itemid`). The name
`temp_table`, used in the example for illustrative purposes, is often
abbreviated as `t`.

The following table shows the query results.

#NameAddressCityItem\_IDOrder\_date1Carlos123 Main St.Anytown678911/11/20222Carlos123 Main St.Anytown435212/12/2022
