# SQL syntax for prepared statements

You can use the `PREPARE`, `EXECUTE` and `DEALLOCATE
                    PREPARE` SQL statements to run parameterized queries in the Athena console
query editor.

- To specify parameters where you would normally use literal values, use
question marks in the `PREPARE` statement.

- To replace the parameters with values when you run the query, use the
`USING` clause in the `EXECUTE` statement.

- To remove a prepared statement from the prepared statements in a
workgroup, use the `DEALLOCATE PREPARE` statement.

The following sections provide additional detail about each of these
statements.
