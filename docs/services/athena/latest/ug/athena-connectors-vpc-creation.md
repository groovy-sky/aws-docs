# Create a VPC for a data source connector or AWS Glue connection

Some Athena data source connectors and AWS Glue connections require a VPC and a security
group. This topic shows you how to create a VPC with a subnet and a security group for the
VPC. As part of this process, you retrieve the IDs for the VPC, subnet, and security group
that you create. These IDs are required when you configure your AWS Glue connection or data
source connector for use with Athena.

###### To create a VPC for an Athena data source connector

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. Choose **Create VPC**.

3. On the **Create VPC** page, under **VPC**
**Settings**, for **Resources to create**, choose
    **VPC and more**.

4. Under **Name tag auto-generation**, for
    **Auto-generate**, enter a value that will be used to generate
    name tags for all resources in your VPC.

5. Choose **Create VPC**.

6. When the process completes, choose **View VPC**.

7. In the **Details** section, for **VPC ID**, copy
    your VPC ID for later reference.

Now you are ready to retrieve the subnet ID for the VPC that you just created.

###### To retrieve your VPC subnet ID

1. In the VPC console navigation pane, choose **Subnets**.

2. Select the name of a subnet whose **VPC** column has the VPC ID
    that you noted.

3. In the **Details** section, for **Subnet ID**,
    copy your subnet ID for later reference.

Next, you create a security group for your VPC.

###### To create a security group for your VPC

1. In the VPC console navigation pane, choose **Security**,
    **Security Groups**.

2. Choose **Create security group**.

3. On the **Create security group** page, enter the following
    information:

- For **Security group name**, enter a name for your
security group.

- For **Description**, enter a description for the security
group. A description is required.

- For **VPC**, choose the VPC ID of the VPC that you
created for your data source connector.

- For **Inbound rules** and **Outbound**
**rules**, add any inbound and outbound rules that you
require.

4. Choose **Create security group**.

5. On the **Details** page for the security group, copy the
    **Security group ID** for later reference.

## Important considerations for using VPC with Athena connectors

The following instructions apply to all Athena connectors, as all connectors can utilize VPC.

###### Note

When using a VPC with AWS Glue connections, you will need to set up the following PrivateLink endpoints:

- Amazon S3

- AWS Glue

- AWS Secrets Manager

Alternatively, you can use public internet access, though this is not recommended for security reasons.

###### Warning

Using public internet access may expose your resources to additional security risks. It is strongly recommended to use PrivateLink endpoints for enhanced security in your VPC configuration.
