# Create CTAS queries in the Athena console

In the Athena console, you can create a CTAS query from another query.

###### To create a CTAS query from another query

1. Run the query in the Athena console query editor.

2. At the bottom of the query editor, choose the **Create** option,
    and then choose **Table from query**.

3. In the **Create table as select** form, complete the fields as
    follows:
1. For **Table name**, enter the name for your new table.
       Use only lowercase and underscores, such as
       `my_select_query_parquet`.

2. For **Database configuration**, use the options to choose
       an existing database or create a database.

3. (Optional) In **Result configuration**, for
       **Location of CTAS query results**, if your workgroup
       query results location setting does not override this option, do one of the
       following:

- Enter the path to an existing S3 location in the search box, or
choose **Browse S3** to choose a location from a
list.

- Choose **View** to open the
**Buckets** page of the Amazon S3 console where you
can view more information about your existing buckets and choose or
create a bucket with your own settings.

You should specify an empty location in Amazon S3 where the data will be
output. If data already exists in the location that you specify, the query
fails with an error.

If your workgroup query results location setting overrides this location
setting, Athena creates your table in the location
`s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/tables/query_id/`

4. For **Data format**, specify the format that your data is
       in.

- Table type – The default
table type in Athena is Apache Hive.

- File format – Choose among
options like CSV, TSV, JSON, Parquet, or ORC. For information about
the Parquet and ORC formats, see [Use columnar storage formats](columnar-storage.md).

- Write compression –
(Optional) Choose a compression format. Athena supports a variety of
compression formats for reading and writing data, including reading
from a table that uses multiple compression formats. For example,
Athena can successfully read the data in a table that uses Parquet
file format when some Parquet files are compressed with Snappy and
other Parquet files are compressed with GZIP. The same principle
applies for ORC, text file, and JSON storage formats. For more
information, see [Use compression in Athena](compression-formats.md).

- Partitions – (Optional)
Select the columns that you want to partition. Partitioning your
data restricts the amount of data scanned by each query, thus
improving performance and reducing cost. You can partition your data
by any key. For more information, see [Partition your data](partitions.md).

- Buckets – (Optional) Select
the columns that you want to bucket. Bucketing is a technique that
groups data based on specific columns together within a single
partition. These columns are known as _bucket_
_keys_. By grouping related data into a single bucket
(a file within a partition), you significantly reduce the amount of
data scanned by Athena, thus improving query performance and reducing
cost. For more information, see [Use partitioning and bucketing](ctas-partitioning-and-bucketing.md).

5. For **Preview table query**, review your query. For query
       syntax, see [CREATE TABLE AS](create-table-as.md).

6. Choose **Create table**.

The Athena console has a SQL template that you can also use to create a CTAS query.

###### To create a CTAS query using a SQL template

Use the `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` template to create a CTAS query in the
query editor.

1. In the Athena console, next to **Tables and views**, choose
    **Create table**, and then choose **CREATE TABLE AS**
**SELECT**. This populates the query editor with a CTAS query with
    placeholder values.

2. In the query editor, edit the query as needed. For query syntax, see [CREATE TABLE AS](create-table-as.md).

3. Choose **Run**.

For examples, see [Examples of CTAS queries](ctas-examples.md).
