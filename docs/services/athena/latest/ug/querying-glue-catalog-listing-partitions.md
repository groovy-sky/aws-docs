<a name="querying-glue-catalog-listing-partitions"></a>

You can use `SHOW PARTITIONS {{table_name}}` to list the partitions for a specified table, as in the following example.

```
SHOW PARTITIONS cloudtrail_logs_test2
```

You can also use a `$partitions` metadata query to list the partition numbers and partition values for a specific table.

**Example – Querying the partitions for a table using the $partitions syntax**
The following example query lists the partitions for the table `cloudtrail_logs_test2` using the `$partitions` syntax.

```
SELECT * FROM default."cloudtrail_logs_test2$partitions" ORDER BY partition_number
```
The following table shows sample results.

|  | table\_catalog | table\_schema | table\_name | Year | Month | Day |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | awsdatacatalog | default | cloudtrail\_logs\_test2 | 2020 | 08 | 10 |
