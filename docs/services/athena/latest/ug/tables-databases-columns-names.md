# Name databases, tables, and columns

Use these guidelines for naming databases, tables, and columns in Athena.

## Database, table, and column name requirements

- Acceptable characters for database names, table names, and column names in
AWS Glue must be a UTF-8 string and should be in lower case. Note that Athena
automatically lowers any upper case names in DDL queries when it creates
databases, tables, or columns. The string must not be less than 1 or more than
255 bytes long.

- Currently, it is possible to have leading spaces at the start of names.
Because these leading spaces can be hard to detect and can cause usability
issues after creation, avoid inadvertently creating object names that have
leading spaces.

- If you use an [AWS::Glue::Database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-glue-database.html) CloudFormation template to create an AWS Glue database and
do not specify a database name, AWS Glue automatically generates a database name in
the format `resource_name–random_string` that is
not compatible with Athena.

- You can use the AWS Glue Catalog Manager to rename columns, but not table names
or database names. To work around this limitation, you must use a definition of
the old database to create a database with the new name. Then you use
definitions of the tables from the old database to re-create the tables in the
new database. To do this, you can use the AWS CLI or AWS Glue SDK. For steps, see
[Use the AWS CLI to recreate an AWS Glue database and its tables](glue-recreate-db-and-tables-cli.md).

## Use lower case for table names and table column names in Athena

Athena accepts mixed case in DDL and DML queries, but lower cases the names when it
executes the query. For this reason, avoid using mixed case for table or column names,
and do not rely on casing alone in Athena to distinguish such names. For example, if you
use a DDL statement to create a column named `Castle`, the column created
will be lowercased to `castle`. If you then specify the column name in a DML
query as `Castle` or `CASTLE`, Athena will lowercase the name for
you to run the query, but display the column heading using the casing that you chose in
the query.

Database, table, and column names must be less than or equal to 255 characters
long.

## Names that begin with an underscore

When creating tables, use backticks to enclose table, view, or column names that begin
with an underscore. For example:

```sql

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `_myunderscoretable`(
  `_id` string, `_index` string)
LOCATION 's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/'
```

## Table, view, or column names that begin with numbers

When running `SELECT`, `CTAS`, or `VIEW` queries, put
quotation marks around identifiers like table, view, or column names that start with a
digit. For example:

```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW "123view" AS
SELECT "123columnone", "123columntwo"
FROM "234table"
```

## Column names and complex types

For complex types, only alphanumeric characters, underscore ( `_`), and
period ( `.`) are allowed in column names. To create a table and mappings for
keys that have restricted characters, you can use a custom DDL statement. For more
information, see the article [Create tables in Amazon Athena from nested JSON and mappings using JSONSerDe](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/create-tables-in-amazon-athena-from-nested-json-and-mappings-using-jsonserde) in
the _AWS Big Data Blog_.

## Reserved words

Certain reserved words in Athena must be escaped. To escape reserved keywords in DDL
statements, enclose them in backticks (\`). To escape reserved keywords in SQL
`SELECT` statements and in queries on [views](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/views.html), enclose them in double quotes ('').

For more information, see [Escape reserved keywords in queries](reserved-words.md).
