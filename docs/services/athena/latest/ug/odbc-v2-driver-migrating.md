# Migrate to the ODBC 2.x driver

Because most Athena ODBC 2.x connection parameters are backwardly compatible with the ODBC
1.x driver, you can reuse most of your existing connection string with the Athena ODBC 2.x
driver. However, the following connection parameters require modifications.

## Log level

While the current ODBC driver provides a range of available logging options, starting
from `LOG_OFF (0)` to `LOG_TRACE (6)`, the Amazon Athena ODBC 2.x driver
initially had only two values: 0 (disabled) and 1 (enabled). Starting with version 2.0.6.0,
the driver now supports more granular logging levels with enhanced logging capabilities:

- `OFF` \- Logging is disabled

- `ERROR` \- Only error messages are logged

- `WARN` \- Warning messages and errors are logged

- `INFO` \- Informational messages, warnings, and errors are logged

- `DEBUG` \- Detailed debug information plus all lower level messages are logged

- `TRACE` \- Most detailed level of logging, includes all messages

For more information about logging the ODBC 2.x driver, see [Logging options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/odbc-v2-driver-logging-options.html).

For versions before 2.0.6.0: `0,1`

For version 2.0.6.0 and later: `OFF`, `ERROR`, `WARN`,
`INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE`

**Connection string example**`LogLevel=6;``LogLevel=INFO;`

###### Note

In version 2.0.6.0 and later, the logging framework has been optimized to reduce
operational delays and excessive log file generation, while providing more detailed
diagnostic information through these granular log levels. Each level includes all messages
from the levels below it.

## MetadataRetrievalMethod

The current ODBC driver provides several options for retrieving the metadata from
Athena. The Amazon Athena ODBC driver deprecates the `MetadataRetrievalMethod` and
always uses the Amazon Athena API to extract metadata.

Athena introduces the flag `QueryExternalCatalogs` for querying external
catalogs. To query external catalogs with the current ODBC driver, set
`MetadataRetrievalMethod` to `ProxyAPI`. To query external
catalogs with the Athena ODBC driver, set `QueryExternalCatalogs` to
`1`.

`Query``0`, `1`**Connection string example**`MetadataRetrievalMethod=ProxyAPI;``QueryExternalCatalogs=1;`

## Connection test

When you test an ODBC 1.x driver connection, the driver runs a `SELECT 1`
query that generates two files in your Amazon S3 bucket: one for the result set, and one for
the metadata. The test connection is charged according to the [Amazon Athena Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/pricing) policy.

When you test an ODBC 2.x driver connection, the driver calls the [GetWorkGroup](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-getworkgroup.md) Athena API action. The
call uses the authentication type and corresponding credentials provider that you
specified to retrieve the credentials. There is no charge for the connection test when
you use the ODBC 2.x driver, and the test does not generate query results in your Amazon S3
bucket.
