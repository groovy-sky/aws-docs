# Enable federated access to the Athena API

This section discusses federated access that allows a user or client application in your
organization to call Amazon Athena API operations. In this case, your organization's users don't
have direct access to Athena. Instead, you manage user credentials outside of AWS in
Microsoft Active Directory. Active Directory supports [SAML 2.0](https://wiki.oasis-open.org/security) (Security Assertion Markup
Language 2.0).

To authenticate users in this scenario, use the JDBC or ODBC driver with SAML.2.0 support
to access Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) 3.0 and enable a client application to
call Athena API operations.

For more information about SAML 2.0 support on AWS, see [About SAML 2.0 federation](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-providers-saml.md) in
the _IAM User Guide_.

###### Note

Federated access to the Athena API is supported for a particular type of identity
provider (IdP), the Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS 3.0), which is part of
Windows Server. Federated access is not compatible with the IAM Identity Center trusted identity
propagation feature. Access is established through the versions of JDBC or ODBC drivers
that support SAML 2.0. For information, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with JDBC](connect-with-jdbc.md) and [Connect to Amazon Athena with ODBC](connect-with-odbc.md).

## Before you begin

Before you begin, complete the following prerequisites:

- Inside your organization, install and configure the ADFS 3.0 as your
IdP.

- Install and configure the latest available versions of JDBC or ODBC drivers on
clients that are used to access Athena. The driver must include support for
federated access compatible with SAML 2.0. For information, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with JDBC](connect-with-jdbc.md) and [Connect to Amazon Athena with ODBC](connect-with-odbc.md).

## Understand the authentication process

The following diagram illustrates the authentication process of federated access to
the Athena API.

![Diagram of federated access to the Athena API.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/athena-saml-based-federation.png)

1. A user in your organization uses a client application with the JDBC or ODBC
    driver to request authentication from your organization's IdP. The IdP is ADFS
    3.0.

2. The IdP authenticates the user against Active Directory, which is your
    organization's Identity Store.

3. The IdP constructs a SAML assertion with information about the user and sends
    the assertion to the client application via the JDBC or ODBC driver.

4. The JDBC or ODBC driver calls the AWS Security Token Service [AssumeRoleWithSAML](../../../../reference/sts/latest/apireference/api-assumerolewithsaml.md)
    API operation, passing it the following parameters:

- The ARN of the SAML provider

- The ARN of the role to assume

- The SAML assertion from the IdP

For more information, see [AssumeRoleWithSAML](../../../../reference/sts/latest/apireference/api-assumerolewithsaml.md),
in the _AWS Security Token Service API Reference_.

5. The API response to the client application via the JDBC or ODBC driver
    includes temporary security credentials.

6. The client application uses the temporary security credentials to call Athena
    API operations, allowing your users to access Athena API operations.

## Procedure: Enable SAML-based federated access to the Athena API

This procedure establishes trust between your organization's IdP and your AWS account to
enable SAML-based federated access to the Amazon Athena API operation.

###### To enable federated access to the Athena API:

1. In your organization, register AWS as a service provider (SP) in your IdP. This
    process is known as _relying party trust_. For more information,
    see [Configuring your SAML 2.0 IdP with relying party trust](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-providers-create-saml-relying-party.md) in the
    _IAM User Guide_. As part of this task, perform these
    steps:
1. Obtain the sample SAML metadata document from this URL: [https://signin.aws.amazon.com/static/saml-metadata.xml](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/static/saml-metadata.xml).

2. In your organization's IdP (ADFS), generate an equivalent metadata XML
       file that describes your IdP as an identity provider to AWS. Your metadata
       file must include the issuer name, creation date, expiration date, and keys
       that AWS uses to validate authentication responses (assertions) from your
       organization.
2. In the IAM console, create a SAML identity provider entity. For more
    information, see [Creating SAML identity providers](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-providers-create-saml.md) in the
    _IAM User Guide_. As part of this step, do the following:
1. Open the IAM console at
       [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. Upload the SAML metadata document produced by the IdP (ADFS) in Step 1 in
       this procedure.
3. In the IAM console, create one or more IAM roles for your IdP. For more
    information, see [Creating a\
    role for a third-party Identity Provider (federation)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-idp.md) in the
    _IAM User Guide_. As part of this step, do the following:

- In the role's permission policy, list actions that users from your
organization are allowed to do in AWS.

- In the role's trust policy, set the SAML provider entity that you created
in Step 2 of this procedure as the principal.

This establishes a trust relationship between your organization and AWS.

4. In your organization's IdP (ADFS), define assertions that map users or groups in
    your organization to the IAM roles. The mapping of users and groups to the IAM
    roles is also known as a _claim rule_. Note that different users
    and groups in your organization might map to different IAM roles.

For information about configuring the mapping in ADFS, see the blog post: [Enabling federation to AWS using Windows Active Directory, ADFS, and SAML\
    2.0](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/enabling-federation-to-aws-using-windows-active-directory-adfs-and-saml-2-0).

5. Install and configure the JDBC or ODBC driver with SAML 2.0 support. For
    information, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with JDBC](connect-with-jdbc.md) and [Connect to Amazon Athena with ODBC](connect-with-odbc.md).

6. Specify the connection string from your application to the JDBC or ODBC driver.
    For information about the connection string that your application should use, see
    the topic _"Using the Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)_
_Credentials Provider"_ in the _JDBC Driver Installation and_
_Configuration Guide_, or a similar topic in the _ODBC Driver_
_Installation and Configuration Guide_ available as PDF downloads from
    the [Connect to Amazon Athena with JDBC](connect-with-jdbc.md) and [Connect to Amazon Athena with ODBC](connect-with-odbc.md) topics.

Following is a high-level summary of configuring the connection string to the
    drivers:

1. In the `AwsCredentialsProviderClass configuration`, set the
    `com.simba.athena.iamsupport.plugin.AdfsCredentialsProvider`
    to indicate that you want to use SAML 2.0 based authentication via ADFS IdP.

2. For `idp_host`, provide the host name of the ADFS IdP
    server.

3. For `idp_port`, provide the port number that the ADFS IdP
    listens on for the SAML assertion request.

4. For `UID` and `PWD`, provide the AD domain user
    credentials. When using the driver on Windows, if `UID` and
    `PWD` are not provided, the driver attempts to obtain the
    user credentials of the user logged in to the Windows machine.

5. Optionally, set `ssl_insecure` to `true`. In this
    case, the driver does not check the authenticity of the SSL certificate for
    the ADFS IdP server. Setting to `true` is needed if the ADFS
    IdP's SSL certificate has not been configured to be trusted by the
    driver.

6. To enable mapping of an Active Directory domain user or group to one or
    more IAM roles (as mentioned in step 4 of this procedure), in the
    `preferred_role` for the JDBC or ODBC connection, specify the
    IAM role (ARN) to assume for the driver connection. Specifying the
    `preferred_role` is optional, and is useful if the role is
    not the first role listed in the claim rule.

As a result of this procedure, the following actions occur:

1. The JDBC or ODBC driver calls the AWS STS [AssumeRoleWithSAML](../../../../reference/sts/latest/apireference/api-assumerolewithsaml.md) API, and passes it the assertions, as shown
    in step 4 of the [architecture\
    diagram](#access-federation-diagram).

2. AWS makes sure that the request to assume the role comes from the IdP
    referenced in the SAML provider entity.

3. If the request is successful, the AWS STS [AssumeRoleWithSAML](../../../../reference/sts/latest/apireference/api-assumerolewithsaml.md) API operation returns a set of temporary
    security credentials, which your client application uses to make signed
    requests to Athena.

Your application now has information about the current user and can access
    Athena programmatically.
