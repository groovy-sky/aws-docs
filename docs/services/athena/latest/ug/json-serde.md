# JSON SerDe libraries

In Athena, you can use SerDe libraries to deserialize JSON data. Deserialization converts
the JSON data so that it can be serialized (written out) into a different format like
Parquet or ORC.

- [Hive JSON SerDe](hive-json-serde.md)

- [OpenX JSON SerDe](openx-json-serde.md)

- [Amazon Ion Hive SerDe](ion-serde.md)

###### Note

The Hive and OpenX libraries expect JSON data to be on a single line (not formatted),
with records separated by a new line character.

Because Amazon Ion is a superset of JSON, you can use the Amazon Ion Hive SerDe to query
non-Amazon Ion JSON datasets. Unlike the Hive and OpenX JSON SerDe libraries, the Amazon Ion
SerDe does not expect each row of data to be on a single line. This feature is useful if you
want to query JSON datasets that are in "pretty print" format or otherwise break up the
fields in a row with newline characters.

## Library names

generates `CREATE TABLE` statements from example JSON documents. The
`CREATE TABLE` statements that are generated use the OpenX JSON
Serde.
