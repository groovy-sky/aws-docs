# Saving a previous feature flag version to a new version

When you update a feature flag, AWS AppConfig automatically saves your changes to a new
version. If you want to use a previous feature flag version, you must copy it to a draft
version and then save it. You can't edit and save changes to a previous flag version
without saving it to a new version.

###### To edit a previous feature flag version and save it to a new version

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/appconfig/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/appconfig).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Applications**, and then choose
    the application with the feature flag you want to edit and save to a new
    version.

3. On the **Configuration profiles and feature flags** tab, choose
    the configuration profile with the feature flag you want to edit and save to a new
    version.

4. On the **Feature flags** tab, use the
    **Version** list to choose the version you want to edit and save to
    a new version.

5. Choose **Copy to draft version**.

6. In the **Version label** field, enter a new label (optional, but
    recommended).

7. In the **Version description** field, enter a new description
    (optional, but recommended).

8. Choose **Save version**.

9. Choose **Start deployment** to deploy the new version.
