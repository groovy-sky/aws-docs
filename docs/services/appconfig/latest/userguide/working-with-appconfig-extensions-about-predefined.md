# Working with AWS authored extensions

AWS AppConfig includes the following AWS authored extensions. These extensions can help you
integrate the AWS AppConfig workflow with other services. You can use these extensions in the
AWS Management Console or by calling extension [API actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/2019-10-09/APIReference/API_Operations.html) directly
from the AWS CLI, AWS Tools for PowerShell, or the SDK.
