# Monitoring deployments for automatic rollback

During a deployment, you can mitigate situations where malformed or incorrect
configuration data causes errors in your application by using a combination of AWS AppConfig [deployment\
strategies](appconfig-creating-deployment-strategy.md) and automatic rollbacks based on Amazon CloudWatch alarms. Once configured, if one
or more CloudWatch alarms go into the `ALARM` or `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state
during a deployment, AWS AppConfig automatically rolls back your configuration data to the previous
version, thereby preventing application outages or errors.

###### Note

A deployment doesn't automatically roll back if actions have been disabled in an
associated CloudWatch alarm.

You can disable and enable alarms by using the [DisableAlarmActions](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatch/latest/apireference/api-disablealarmactions.md) and [EnableAlarmActions](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatch/latest/apireference/api-enablealarmactions.md) API actions, or
the [disable-alarm-actions](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/disable-alarm-actions.md) and [enable-alarm-actions](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/enable-alarm-actions.md)
commands in the AWS CLI.

You can also roll back a configuration by calling the [StopDeployment](../../../../reference/appconfig/2019-10-09/apireference/api-stopdeployment.md) API
operation while a deployment is still in progress.

###### Important

For deployments that successfully complete, AWS AppConfig also supports reverting configuration
data to a previous version by using the `AllowRevert` parameter with the [StopDeployment](../../../../reference/appconfig/2019-10-09/apireference/api-stopdeployment.md) API operation. For some customers, reverting to a previous
configuration after a successful deployment guarantees the data will be the same as it was
before the deployment. Reverting also ignores alarm monitors, which may prevent a roll
forward from progressing during an application emergency. For more information, see [Reverting a configuration](appconfig-deploying-reverting.md).

To configure automatic rollbacks, you specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of one or
more CloudWatch metrics in the **CloudWatch alarms** field when you create (or edit) an
AWS AppConfig environment. For more information, see [Creating environments for your application in AWS AppConfig](appconfig-creating-environment.md).

###### Note

If you use a third-party monitoring solution (for example, Datadog), you can create an
AWS AppConfig extension that checks for alarms at the `AT_DEPLOYMENT_TICK` action point
and, as a safety guardrail, rolls back the deployment if it triggered an alarm. For more
information about AWS AppConfig extensions, see [Extending AWS AppConfig workflows using extensions](working-with-appconfig-extensions.md). For more information about custom
extensions, see [Walkthrough: Creating custom AWS AppConfig extensions](working-with-appconfig-extensions-creating-custom.md). To view a code sample
of an AWS AppConfig extension that uses the `AT_DEPLOYMENT_TICK` action point to
integrate with Datadog, see [aws-samples /\
aws-appconfig-tick-extn-for-datadog](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-appconfig-tick-extn-for-datadog) on GitHub.

## Recommended metrics to monitor for automatic rollback

The metrics you choose to monitor will depend on the hardware and software used by your
applications. AWS AppConfig customers often monitor the following metrics. For a complete list of
recommended metrics grouped by AWS service, see [Recommended alarms](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

After you determine the metrics you want to monitor, use CloudWatch to configure alarms. For
more information, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch\
alarms](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/alarmthatsendsemail.md).

ServiceMetricDetails

[Amazon API Gateway](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md#ApiGateway)

4XXError

This alarm detects a high rate of client-side errors. This can indicate an
issue in the authorization or client request parameters. It could also mean that a
resource was removed or a client is requesting one that doesn't exist. Consider
enabling Amazon CloudWatch Logs and checking for any errors that may be causing the 4XX errors.
Moreover, consider enabling detailed CloudWatch metrics to view this metric per resource
and method and narrow down the source of the errors. Errors could also be caused
by exceeding the configured throttling limit.

[Amazon API Gateway](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md#ApiGateway)

5XXError

This alarm helps to detect a high rate of server-side errors. This can
indicate that there is something wrong on the API backend, the network, or the
integration between the API gateway and the backend API.

[Amazon API Gateway](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md#ApiGateway)

Latency

This alarm detects high latency in a stage. Find the
`IntegrationLatency` metric value to check the API backend latency.
If the two metrics are mostly aligned, the API backend is the source of higher
latency and you should investigate there for issues. Consider also enabling CloudWatch Logs
and checking for errors that might be causing the high latency.

[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md#AutoScaling)

GroupInServiceCapacity

This alarm helps to detect when the capacity in the group is below the desired
capacity required for your workload. To troubleshoot, check your scaling
activities for launch failures and confirm that your desired capacity
configuration is correct.

[Amazon EC2](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md#EC2)

CPUUtilization

This alarm helps to monitor the CPU utilization of an EC2 instance. Depending
on the application, consistently high utilization levels might be normal. But if
performance is degraded, and the application is not constrained by disk I/O,
memory, or network resources, then a maxed-out CPU might indicate a resource
bottleneck or application performance problems.

[Amazon ECS](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md#ECS)

CPUReservation

This alarm helps you detect a high CPU reservation of the ECS cluster. High
CPU reservation might indicate that the cluster is running out of registered CPUs
for the task.

[Amazon ECS](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md#ECS)

HTTPCode\_Target\_5XX\_Count

This alarm helps you detect a high server-side error count for the ECS
service. This can indicate that there are errors that cause the server to be
unable to serve requests.

[Amazon EKS with Container insights](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md#EKS-ContainerInsights)

node\_cpu\_utilization

This alarm helps to detect high CPU utilization in worker nodes of the Amazon EKS
cluster. If the utilization is consistently high, it might indicate a need for
replacing your worker nodes with instances that have greater CPU or a need to
scale the system horizontally.

[Amazon EKS with Container insights](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md#EKS-ContainerInsights)

node\_memory\_utilization

This alarm helps in detecting high memory utilization in worker nodes of the
Amazon EKS cluster. If the utilization is consistently high, it might indicate a need
to scale the number of pod replicas, or optimize your application.

[Amazon EKS with Container insights](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md#EKS-ContainerInsights)

pod\_cpu\_utilization\_over\_pod\_limit

This alarm helps in detecting high CPU utilization in pods of the Amazon EKS
cluster. If the utilization is consistently high, it might indicate a need to
increase the CPU limit for the affected pod.

[Amazon EKS with Container insights](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md#EKS-ContainerInsights)

pod\_memory\_utilization\_over\_pod\_limit

This alarm helps in detecting high CPU utilization in pods of the Amazon EKS
cluster. If the utilization is consistently high, it might indicate a need to
increase the CPU limit for the affected pod.

[AWS Lambda](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md#Lambda)

Errors

This alarm detects high error counts. Errors includes the exceptions thrown by
the code as well as exceptions thrown by the Lambda runtime.

[AWS Lambda](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md#Lambda)

Throttles

This alarm detects a high number of throttled invocation requests. Throttling
occurs when there is no concurrency is available for scale up.

[Lambda Insights](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md#LambdaInsights)

memory\_utilization

This alarm is used to detect if the memory utilization of a lambda function is
approaching the configured limit.

[Amazon S3](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md#S3)

4xxErrors

This alarm helps us report the total number of 4xx error status codes that are
made in response to client requests. 403 error codes might indicate an incorrect
IAM policy, and 404 error codes might indicate mis-behaving client application,
for example.

[Amazon S3](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/best-practice-recommended-alarms-aws-services.md#S3)

5xxErrors

This alarm helps you detect a high number of server-side errors. These errors
indicate that a client made a request that the server couldn’t complete. This can
help you correlate the issue your application is facing because of S3.
