# Using a manifest to enable additional retrieval features

AWS AppConfig Agent offers the following additional features to help you retrieve
configurations for your applications.

- [Configuring AWS AppConfig Agent to retrieve configurations from multiple accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-agent-how-to-use-additional-features-multi-account.html): Use
AWS AppConfig Agent from a primary or _retrieval_ AWS account to retrieve
configuration data from multiple vendor accounts.

- [Configuring AWS AppConfig Agent to write configuration copies to disk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-agent-how-to-use-additional-features-write-to-disk.html): Use
AWS AppConfig Agent to write configuration data to disk. This feature enables customers with
applications that read configuration data from disk to integrate with AWS AppConfig.

## Understanding agent manifests

To enable these AWS AppConfig Agent features, you create a manifest. A manifest is a set of
configuration data that you provide to control actions the agent can perform. A manifest
is written in JSON. It contains a set of top-level keys that correspond to different
configurations you’ve deployed using AWS AppConfig.

A manifest can include multiple configurations. Furthermore, each configuration in the
manifest can identify one or more agent features to use for the specified configuration.
The content of the manifest uses the following format:

```nohighlight

{
    "application_name:environment_name:configuration_name": {
        "agent_feature_to_enable_1": {
            "feature-setting-key": "feature-setting-value"
        },
        "agent_feature_to_enable_2": {
            "feature-setting-key": "feature-setting-value"
        }
    }
}
```

Here is example JSON for a manifest with two configurations. The first configuration
( `MyApp`) doesn't use any AWS AppConfig Agent features. The second
configuration ( `My2ndApp`) uses the _write configuration_
_copy to disk_ and the _multi-account retrieval_
features:

```

{
        "MyApp:Test:MyAllowListConfiguration": {},

        "My2ndApp:Beta:MyEnableMobilePaymentsFeatureFlagConfiguration": {
            "credentials": {
                "roleArn": "arn:aws:us-west-1:iam::123456789012:role/MyTestRole",
                "roleExternalId": "00b148e2-4ea4-46a1-ab0f-c422b54d0aac",
                "roleSessionName": "AwsAppConfigAgent",
                "credentialsDuration": "2h"
            },
            "writeTo": {
                "path": "/tmp/aws-appconfig/my-2nd-app/beta/my-enable-payments-feature-flag-configuration.json"
            }
        }
    }
```

###### How to supply an agent manifest

You can store the manifest as a file in a location where AWS AppConfig Agent can read it.
Or, you can store the manifest as an AWS AppConfig configuration and point the agent to it. To
supply an agent manifest, you must set a `MANIFEST` environment variable with
one of the following values:

Manifest locationEnvironment variable valueUse case

File

file:/path/to/agent-manifest.json

Use this method if your manifest won't change often.

AWS AppConfig configuration

`application-name`: `environment-name`: `configuration-name`

Use this method for dynamic updates. You can update and deploy a manifest
stored in AWS AppConfig as a configuration in the same ways you store other AWS AppConfig
configurations.

Environment variable

Manifest content (JSON)

Use this method if your manifest won't change often. This method is useful
in container environments where it's easier to set an environment variable than
it is to expose a file.
