# Understanding the AWS AppConfig hosted configuration store

AWS AppConfig includes an internal or hosted configuration store. Configurations must be 2 MB
or smaller. The AWS AppConfig hosted configuration store provides the following benefits over
other configuration store options.

- You don't need to set up and configure other services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or
Parameter Store.

- You don't need to configure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions to use the configuration
store.

- You can store configurations in YAML, JSON, or as text documents.

- There is no cost to use the store.

- You can create a configuration and add it to the store when you create a
configuration profile.
