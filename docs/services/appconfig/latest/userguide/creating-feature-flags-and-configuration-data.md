# Creating feature flags and free form configuration data in AWS AppConfig

The topics in this section help you complete the following tasks in AWS AppConfig. These tasks
create important artifacts for deploying configuration data.

**1\. [Create an application\**
**namespace](appconfig-creating-namespace.md)**

To create an application namespace, you create an AWS AppConfig artifact called an
application. An application is simply an organizational construct like a folder.

**2\. [Create\**
**environments](appconfig-creating-environment.md)**

For each AWS AppConfig application, you define one or more environments. An environment is a
logical deployment group of AWS AppConfig targets, such as applications in a `Beta` or
`Production` environment. You can also define environments for application
subcomponents, such as `AWS Lambda functions`, `Containers`,
`Web`, `Mobile`, and `Back-end`.

You can configure Amazon CloudWatch alarms for each environment to automatically rollback
problematic configuration changes. The system monitors alarms during a configuration
deployment. If an alarm is triggered, the system rolls back the configuration.

**3\. [Create a\**
**configuration profile](appconfig-creating-configuration-profile.md)**

_Configuration data_ is a collection of settings that influence the
behavior of your application. A _configuration profile_ includes, among
other things, a URI that enables AWS AppConfig to locate your configuration data in its stored
location and a configure type. AWS AppConfig supports the following types of configuration
profiles:

- **Feature flags**: You can use feature flags to enable or
disable features within your applications or to configure different characteristics of
your application features using flag attributes. AWS AppConfig stores feature flag configurations
in the AWS AppConfig hosted configuration store in a feature flag format that contains data and
metadata about your flags and the flag attributes. The URI for feature flag configurations
is simply `hosted`.

- **Freeform configurations**: A freeform configuration can
store data in any of the following AWS services and Systems Manager tools:

- AWS AppConfig hosted configuration store

- Amazon Simple Storage Service

- AWS CodePipeline

- AWS Secrets Manager

- AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store

- SSM Document Store

###### Note

If possible, we recommend hosting your configuration data in the AWS AppConfig hosted
configuration store as it offers the most features and enhancements.

**4\. (Optional, but recommended) [Create multi-variant feature flags](appconfig-creating-multi-variant-feature-flags.md)**

AWS AppConfig offers basic feature flags, which (if enabled) return a specific set of
configuration data per request. To better support user segmentation and traffic splitting
use cases, AWS AppConfig also offers multi-variant feature flags, which enable you to define a
set of possible flag values to return for a request. You can also configure different
statuses (enabled or disabled) for multi-variant flags. When requesting a flag configured
with variants, your application provides context that AWS AppConfig evaluates against a set of
user-defined rules. Depending on the context specified in the request and the rules
defined for the variant, AWS AppConfig returns different flag values to the application.
