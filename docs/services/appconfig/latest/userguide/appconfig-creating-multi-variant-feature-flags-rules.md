# Understanding multi-variant feature flag rules

When you create a feature flag variant, you specify a rule for it. Rules are
expressions that take context values as input and produce a boolean result as output.
For example, you could define a rule to select a flag variant for beta users, identified
by their account ID, testing a user interface refresh. For this scenario, you do the
following:

1. Create a new feature flag configuration profile called _UI_
_Refresh_.

2. Create a new feature flag called _ui\_refresh_.

3. Edit the feature flag after you create it to add variants.

4. Create and enable a new variant called _BetaUsers_.

5. Define a rule for _BetaUsers_ that selects the variant if the
    account ID from the request context is in a list of account IDs approved to view the
    new beta experience.

6. Confirm that the default variant’s status is set to
    **Disabled**.

###### Note

Variants are evaluated as an ordered list based on the order they are defined in
the console. The variant at the top of the list is evaluated first. If no rules match
the supplied context, AWS AppConfig returns the Default variant.

When AWS AppConfig processes the feature flag request, it compares the supplied context,
which includes the AccountID (for this example) to the BetaUsers variant first. If the
context matches the rule for BetaUsers, AWS AppConfig returns the configuration data for the
beta experience. If the context doesn’t include an account ID or if the account ID ends
in anything other than 123, AWS AppConfig returns configuration data for the Default rule,
which means the user views the current experience in production.

## Understanding the split operator

The following section describes how the `split` operator behaves when
used in different scenarios. As a reminder, `split` evaluates to
`true` for a given percentage of traffic based on a consistent hash of
the provided context value. To understand this better, consider the following baseline
scenario that uses split with two variants:

```nohighlight

A: (split by::$uniqueId pct::20)
C: <no rule>
```

As expected, providing a random set of `uniqueId` values produces a
distribution that's approximately:

```nohighlight

A: 20%
C: 80%
```

If you add a third variant, but use the same split percentage like so:

```nohighlight

A: (split by::$uniqueId pct::20)
B: (split by::$uniqueId pct::20)
C: <default>
```

You end up with the following distribution:

```nohighlight

A: 20%
B: 0%
C: 80%
```

This potentially unexpected distribution happens because each variant rule is
evaluated in order and the first match determines the returned variant. When rule A is
evaluated, 20% of `uniqueId` values match it, so the first variant is
returned. Next, rule B is evaluated. However, all of the `uniqueId` values
that would have matched the second split statement were already matched by variant
rule A, so no values match B. The default variant is returned instead.

Now consider a third example.

```nohighlight

A: (split by::$uniqueId pct::20)
B: (split by::$uniqueId pct::25)
C: <default>
```

As with the previous example, the first 20% of `uniqueId` values match
rule A. For variant rule B, 25% of all `uniqueId` values would match, but
most of those previously matched rule A. That leaves 5% of the total for variant B,
with the remainder receiving variant C. The distribution would look like the
following:

```nohighlight

A: 20%
B: 5%
C: 75%
```

###### Using the `seed` property

You can use the `seed` property to ensure traffic is split
consistently for a given context value irrespective of where the split operator is
used. If you don't specify `seed`, the hash is
_locally_ consistent, meaning traffic will be split
consistently for that flag, but other flags receiving the same context value may
split traffic differently. If `seed` is provided, each unique value is
guaranteed to split traffic consistently across feature flags, configuration
profiles, and AWS accounts.

Typically, customers use the same `seed` value across variants within a
flag when splitting traffic on the same context property. However, it may occasionally
make sense to use a different seed value. Here is an example that uses different seeds
for rules A and B:

```nohighlight

A: (split by::$uniqueId pct::20 seed::"seed_one")
B: (split by::$uniqueId pct::25 seed::"seed_two")
C: <default>
```

As before, 20% of the matching `uniqueId` values match rule A. That
means 80% of values fall through and are tested against variant rule B. Because the
seed is different, there is no correlation between the values that matched A and the
values that match B. There are, however, only 80% as many `uniqueId` values
to split with 25% of that number matching rule B and 75% not. That works out to the
following distribution:

```nohighlight

A: 20%
B: 20% (25% of what falls through from A, or 25% of 80%)
C: 60%
```
