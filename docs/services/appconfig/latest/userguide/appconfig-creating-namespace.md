# Creating a namespace for your application in AWS AppConfig

The procedures in this section help you create an AWS AppConfig artifact called an application.
An application is simply an organizational construct like a folder that identifies the
namespace of your application. This organizational construct has a relationship with some unit
of executable code. For example, you could create an application called MyMobileApp to
organize and manage configuration data for a mobile application installed by your users. You
must create these artifacts before you can use AWS AppConfig to deploy and retrieve feature flags or
free form configuration data.

The following procedure gives you the option to associate an extension with a feature flag
configuration profile. An _extension_ augments your ability to inject logic
or behavior at different points during the AWS AppConfig workflow of creating or deploying a
configuration. For more information, see [Understanding AWS AppConfig extensions](working-with-appconfig-extensions-about.md).

###### Note

You can use AWS CloudFormation to create AWS AppConfig artifacts, including applications, environments,
configuration profiles, deployments, deployment strategies, and hosted configuration
versions. For more information, see [AWS AppConfig resource type\
reference](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/aws-appconfig.md) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

## Creating an AWS AppConfig application (console)

Use the following procedure to create an AWS AppConfig application by using the AWS Systems Manager
console.

###### To create an application

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/appconfig/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/appconfig).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Applications**, and then choose
    **Create application**.

3. For **Name**, enter a name for the application.

4. For **Description**, enter information about the
    application.

5. (Optional) In the **Extensions** section, choose an extension from
    the list. For more information, see [Understanding AWS AppConfig extensions](working-with-appconfig-extensions-about.md).

6. (Optional) In the **Tags** section, enter a key and an optional
    value. You can specify a maximum of 50 tags for a resource.

7. Choose **Create application**.

AWS AppConfig creates the application and then displays the **Environments**
tab. Proceed to [Creating environments for your application in AWS AppConfig](appconfig-creating-environment.md).

## Creating an AWS AppConfig application (command line)

The following procedure describes how to use the AWS CLI (on Linux or Windows) or
AWS Tools for PowerShell to create an AWS AppConfig application.

###### To create an application step by step

1. Open the AWS CLI.

2. Run the following command to create an application.
Linux

```nohighlight

aws appconfig create-application \
     --name A_name_for_the_application \
     --description A_description_of_the_application \
     --tags User_defined_key_value_pair_metadata_for_the_application
```

Windows

```nohighlight

aws appconfig create-application ^
     --name A_name_for_the_application ^
     --description A_description_of_the_application ^
     --tags User_defined_key_value_pair_metadata_for_the_application
```

PowerShell

```powershell

New-APPCApplication `
     -Name Name_for_the_application `
     -Description Description_of_the_application `
     -Tag Hashtable_type_user_defined_key_value_pair_metadata_for_the_application
```

The system returns information like the following.
Linux

```
{
      "Id": "Application ID",
      "Name": "Application name",
      "Description": "Description of the application"
}
```

Windows

```
{
      "Id": "Application ID",
      "Name": "Application name",
      "Description": "Description of the application"
}
```

PowerShell

```
ContentLength    : Runtime of the command
Description      : Description of the application
HttpStatusCode   : HTTP Status of the runtime
Id               : Application ID
Name             : Application name
ResponseMetadata : Runtime Metadata
```
