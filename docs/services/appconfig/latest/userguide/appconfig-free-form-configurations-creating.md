# Creating a free form configuration profile in AWS AppConfig
<a name="appconfig-free-form-configurations-creating"></a>

*Configuration data* is a collection of settings that influence the behavior of your application. A *configuration profile* includes, among other things, a URI that enables AWS AppConfig to locate your configuration data in its stored location and a configure type. With freeform configuration profiles, you can store your data in the AWS AppConfig hosted configuration store or any of the following AWS services and Systems Manager tools:

| Location | Supported file types |
| --- | --- |
| AWS AppConfig hosted configuration store | YAML, JSON, and text if added using the AWS Management Console. Any file type if added using the AWS AppConfig [CreateHostedConfigurationVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/2019-10-09/APIReference/API_CreateHostedConfigurationVersion.html) API action. |
| [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) | Any |
| [AWS CodePipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html) | Pipeline (as defined by the service) |
| [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html) | Secret (as defined by the service) |
| [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) | Standard and secure string parameters (as defined by Parameter Store) |
| [AWS Systems Manager document store (SSM documents)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/documents.html) | YAML, JSON, text |

A configuration profile can also include optional validators to ensure your configuration data is syntactically and semantically correct. AWS AppConfig performs a check using the validators when you start a deployment. If any errors are detected, the deployment stops before making any changes to the targets of the configuration.

**Note**
If possible, we recommend hosting your configuration data in the AWS AppConfig hosted configuration store as it offers the most features and enhancements.

For freeform configurations stored in the AWS AppConfig hosted configuration store or SSM documents, you can create the freeform configuration by using the Systems Manager console at the time you create a configuration profile. The process is described later in this topic.

For freeform configurations stored in Parameter Store, Secrets Manager, or Amazon S3, you must create the parameter, secret, or object first and store it in the relevant configuration store. After you store the configuration data, use the procedure in this topic to create the configuration profile.
