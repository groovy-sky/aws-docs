# Understanding configurations stored in Amazon S3

You can store configurations in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. When you create the
configuration profile, you specify the URI to a single S3 object in a bucket. You also
specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that gives AWS AppConfig
permission to get the object. Before you create a configuration profile for an Amazon S3
object, be aware of the following restrictions.

RestrictionDetails

Size

Configurations stored as S3 objects can be a maximum of 1 MB in size.

Object encryption

A configuration profile can target SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS encrypted
objects.

Storage classes

AWS AppConfig supports the following S3 storage classes: `STANDARD`,
`INTELLIGENT_TIERING`, `REDUCED_REDUNDANCY`,
`STANDARD_IA`, and `ONEZONE_IA`. The following classes
are not supported: All S3 Glacier classes ( `GLACIER` and
`DEEP_ARCHIVE`).

Versioning

AWS AppConfig requires that the S3 object use versioning.

## Configuring permissions for a configuration stored as an Amazon S3 object

When you create a configuration profile for a configuration stored as an S3 object,
you must specify an ARN for an IAM role that gives AWS AppConfig permission to get the
object. The role must include the following permissions.

Permissions to access the S3 object

- s3:GetObject

- s3:GetObjectVersion

Permissions to list S3 buckets

s3:ListAllMyBuckets

Permissions to access the S3 bucket where the object is stored

- s3:GetBucketLocation

- s3:GetBucketVersioning

- s3:ListBucket

- s3:ListBucketVersions

Complete the following procedure to create a role that enables AWS AppConfig to get a
configuration stored in an S3 object.

###### Creating the IAM Policy for Accessing an S3 Object

Use the following procedure to create an IAM policy that enables AWS AppConfig to get a
configuration stored in an S3 object.

###### To create an IAM policy for accessing an S3 object

1. Open the IAM console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Policies**, and then choose
    **Create policy**.

3. On the **Create policy** page, choose the
    **JSON** tab.

4. Update the following sample policy with information about your S3 bucket and
    configuration object. Then paste the policy into the text field on the
    **JSON** tab. Replace the `placeholder
                     values` with your own information.
JSON

```json

{
     "Version":"2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:GetObjectVersion"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/my-configurations/my-configuration.json"
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "s3:GetBucketLocation",
           "s3:GetBucketVersioning",
           "s3:ListBucketVersions",
           "s3:ListBucket"
         ],
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket"
         ]
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
}

```

5. Choose **Review policy**.

6. On the **Review policy** page, type a name in the
    **Name** box, and then type a description.

7. Choose **Create policy**. The system returns you to the
    **Roles** page.

###### Creating the IAM Role for Accessing an S3 Object

Use the following procedure to create an IAM role that enables AWS AppConfig to get a
configuration stored in an S3 object.

###### To create an IAM role for accessing an Amazon S3 object

01. Open the IAM console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**, and then choose
     **Create role**.

03. On the **Select type of trusted entity** section, choose
     **AWS service**.

04. In the **Choose a use case** section, under **Common**
    **use cases**, choose **EC2**, and then choose
     **Next: Permissions**.

05. On the **Attach permissions policy** page, in the search box,
     enter the name of the policy you created in the previous procedure.

06. Choose the policy and then choose **Next: Tags**.

07. On the **Add tags (optional)** page, enter a key and an
     optional value, and then choose **Next: Review**.

08. On the **Review** page, type a name in the **Role**
    **name** field, and then type a description.

09. Choose **Create role**. The system returns you to the
     **Roles** page.

10. On the **Roles** page, choose the role you just created to open
     the **Summary** page. Note the **Role Name** and
     **Role ARN**. You will specify the role ARN when you create the
     configuration profile later in this topic.

###### Creating a Trust Relationship

Use the following procedure to configure the role you just created to trust
AWS AppConfig.

###### To add a trust relationship

1. In the **Summary** page for the role you just created, choose
    the **Trust Relationships** tab, and then choose **Edit**
**Trust Relationship**.

2. Delete `"ec2.amazonaws.com"` and add
    `"appconfig.amazonaws.com"`, as shown in the following example.
JSON

```json

{
     "Version":"2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "Service": "appconfig.amazonaws.com"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
       }
     ]
}

```

3. Choose **Update Trust Policy**.
