# Using Select to Create Amazon SimpleDB Queries

This section describes `Select`, a function that takes query
expressions similar to the standard SQL `SELECT` statement.

Use the following format for the `Select` function.

```nohighlight

select output_list
from domain_name
[where expression]
[sort_instructions]
[limit limit]
```

The `output_list` can be any of the following:

- \\* (all attributes)

- itemName() (the item name only)

- count(\*)

- An explicit list of attributes (attribute1,..., attributeN)

Name  Description `domain_name`

The domain to search.

`expression`

The match expression. This rest of this section provides
examples of how to form select expressions.

`sort_instructions`

Sorts the results on a single attribute, in ascending or
descending order. For information on sorting results, see [Sort](sortingdataselect.md).

`limit`

The `limit` is the maximum number of results per page to
return (default: 100, max. 2500).

###### Note

The total size of the response cannot exceed 1 MB.
Amazon SimpleDB automatically adjusts the number of items returned per
page to enforce this limit. For example, even if you ask to
retrieve 2500 items, but each individual item is 10 KB in
size, the system returns 100 items and an appropriate next
token so you can get the next page of results.

The `expression` can be any of the following:

- <select expression> intersection <select expression>

- NOT <select expression>

- (<select expression>)

- <select expression> or <select expression>

- <select expression> and <select expression>

- <simple comparison>

###### Note

For information on how to use quotes with Amazon SimpleDB, see [Select Quoting Rules](quotingrulesselect.md).
