Amazon SimpleDB does not offer its own resource-based permissions system. However, the
service now integrates with IAM (AWS Identity and Access Management) so that you can give other
Users in your AWS Account access to Amazon SimpleDB domains within the AWS Account. For
example, Joe can create an Amazon SimpleDB domain, and then write an IAM policy specifying
which Users in his AWS Account can access that domain. Joe can't give another AWS Account
(or Users in another AWS Account) access to his AWS Account's SimpleDB domains.

###### Important

Aside from the integration with IAM, Amazon
SimpleDB hasn't changed. Its API is not affected by the introduction
of IAM, and includes no new actions related to
Users and access control.

For examples of policies that cover Amazon SimpleDB actions and
resources, see [Example Policies for Amazon SimpleDB](#ExamplePolicies_SDB).

## Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for Amazon SimpleDB

For Amazon SimpleDB, domains are the only resource type you can
specify in a policy. The ARN format for domains follows this format:

```nohighlight

arn:aws:sdb:<region>:<account_ID>:domain/<domain_name>
```

The _<region>_ is required and can be
any of the individual Regions Amazon SimpleDB supports (e.g.,
us-east-1), or \* to represent all Regions. The
_<region>_ must not be blank.

###### Example

Following is an ARN for a domain named Domain1 in the
us-east-1 region, belonging to AWS Account
111122223333.

```

arn:aws:sdb:us-east-1:111122223333:domain/Domain1
```

###### Example

Following is an ARN for a domain named Domain1 in all Regions
that Amazon SimpleDB supports.

```

arn:aws:sdb:*:111122223333:domain/Domain1
```

You can use \* and ? wildcards in the domain name. The \* represents
zero or multiple characters, and ? represents one character. For
example, the following could refer to all the domains prefixed with
`don_`.

```

arn:aws:sdb:*:111122223333:domain/don_*
```

For more information about ARNs, see [ARNs](../../../iam/latest/userguide/using-identifiers.md#Identifiers_ARNs).

## Amazon SimpleDB Actions

In an IAM policy, you can specify any and all
actions that Amazon SimpleDB offers. You must prefix each action
name with the lowercase string `sdb:`. For example:
`sdb:GetAttributes`, `sdb:Select`,
`sdb:*` (for all Amazon SimpleDB actions). For a list
of the actions, see [Operations](sdb-api-operations.md).

## Amazon SimpleDB Keys

Amazon SimpleDB implements the following policy keys, but no
product-specific ones. For more information about policy keys, see
[Condition](../../../iam/latest/userguide/accesspolicylanguage-elementdescriptions.md#Condition).

For a list of condition keys supported by each AWS service, see
[Actions, resources, and condition keys for AWS services](../../../service-authorization/latest/reference/reference-policies-actions-resources-contextkeys.md)
in the _IAM User Guide_. For a list of condition keys that can be used in multiple AWS services, see
[AWS global condition context keys](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-condition-keys.md)
in the _IAM User Guide_.

## Example Policies for Amazon SimpleDB

This section shows several simple policies for controlling User
access to Amazon SimpleDB domains.

###### Note

In the future, Amazon SimpleDB might add new actions that should logically be included
in one of the following policies, based on the policy’s stated goals.

###### Example 1: Allow a group to use any Amazon SimpleDB actions on specific domains

In this example, we create a policy that lets the group use
any of the AWS Account's domains that start with the literal string
`test`.

JSON

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[{
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action":"sdb:*",
      "Resource":"arn:aws:sdb:*:111122223333:domain/test*"
      }
   ]
}

```

###### Example 2: Allow a group to read data from the AWS Account's domains

In this example, we create a policy that lets the group use
the `GetAttributes` and
`Select` actions with any of the
AWS Account's domains.

JSON

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[{
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action":["sdb:GetAttributes","sdb:Select"],
      "Resource":"*"
      }
   ]
}

```

###### Example 3: Allow a group to list domains and get their metadata

In this example, we create a policy that lets the group use
the `ListDomains` and
`DomainMetadata` actions with any of the
AWS Account's domains.

###### Example 4: Allow a partner to only read data from a particular domain

There's no way to share a domain with a different AWS Account,
so the partner must work with your domain as a User within your
own AWS Account.

In this example, we create a user for
the partner, and create a policy for the user that gives access
to the `GetAttributes` and
`Select` actions only on the domain named
_mySDBDomain_.

(Instead of attaching the policy to the User, you could
create a group for the partner, put the User in the group,
and assign the policy to the group.)

You might also want to prevent the partner from doing anything
else with mySDBDomain, so we add a statement that denies
permission to any Amazon SimpleDB actions besides
`GetAttributes` and
`Select`. This is only necessary if
there's also a broad policy that gives the AWS Account's Users wide
access to Amazon SimpleDB and all the AWS Account's domains.

JSON

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[{
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":["sdb:GetAttributes","sdb:Select"],
         "Resource":"arn:aws:sdb:*:111122223333:domain/mySDBDomain"
      },
      {
         "Effect":"Deny",
         "Action":["sdb:GetAttributes","sdb:Select"],
         "Resource":"*"
      }
   ]
}

```
