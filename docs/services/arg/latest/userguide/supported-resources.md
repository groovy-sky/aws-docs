# Resource types you can use with AWS Resource Groups and Tag Editor
<a name="supported-resources"></a>

You can use the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI to create resource groups and then interact with the member resources through those groups. You can add tags to many AWS resources and then use those tags to manage group membership. This topic describes the AWS resource types that you can include in resource groups by using AWS Resource Groups, and the resource types that you can tag by using Tag Editor.

**Important**
A resource group based on a query for **All supported resource types** can add members automatically over time, as new resources are supported by Resource Groups. When you run automations or other bulk tasks on an existing resource group based on **All supported resource types**, be aware that the actions might run on many more resources than were in the group when you first created the group. This might also mean that automations or tasks that you created for other resources are applied to possibly unintended resources, or resources on which the tasks cannot be successfully completed. In those cases, you can add a resource type filter to specify that only resources of the specified types can be part of the group.

![Query based on All supported resource types.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/images/rg-allsupported-resources.png)

The following tables list which resource types are supported for tagging in Tag Editor, for membership in tag query-based groups, and for membership in CloudFormation stack-based groups.

**Column definitions**
+ **Tag Editor Tagging** – You can tag resources of this type by using the [Tag Editor console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/resource-groups/tag-editor/). Otherwise, you must use either the [AWS Resource Groups Tagging API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/overview.html) or the tagging services supported natively by that resource’s owning service.
+ **Tag-based Groups** – You can include resources of this type in [resource groups whose membership is determined by the tags attached to the resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-query.html#gettingstarted-query-tag-based). The group specifies tag key names and values, and any resources with tags that match are automatically part of the group
+ **CloudFormation Stack-based Groups** – You can include resources of this type in [resource groups whose membership consists of the resources created as part of a CloudFormation stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-query.html#gettingstarted-query-stack-based). The group specifies the stack’s ARN, and all of its resources are automatically members of the group. Adding tags to a CloudFormation stack causes an update of the stack.

For a list of resource types that are deprecated and no longer supported by Resource Groups, see the section [Deprecated resource types](#deprecated-types) at the end of this topic.

**Note**
Resource Groups and Tag Editor support the resource types in the following table, but some resource types may not be available in your AWS Region.

¹ This is a resource for a global service that is hosted in the **US East (N. Virginia)** Region. To use Tag Editor to create or modify tags for this resource type, you must include `us-east-1` from the **Select regions** list under **Find resources to tag** in the Tag Editor console.

² This is a resource for a global service that is hosted in the **US East (N. Virginia)** Region. Because Resource Groups are maintained separately for each region, you must switch your AWS Management Console to the AWS Region that contains the resources you want to include in the group. To create a resource group that contains a global resource, you must configure your AWS Management Console to **US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1** using the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the AWS Management Console.

¹ This is a resource for a global service that is hosted in the **US East (N. Virginia)** Region. To use Tag Editor to create or modify tags for this resource type, you must include `us-east-1` from the **Select regions** list under **Find resources to tag** in the Tag Editor console.

² This is a resource for a global service that is hosted in the **US East (N. Virginia)** Region. Because Resource Groups are maintained separately for each region, you must switch your AWS Management Console to the AWS Region that contains the resources you want to include in the group. To create a resource group that contains a global resource, you must configure your AWS Management Console to **US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1** using the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the AWS Management Console.
