# AWS services that work with AWS Resource Groups

You can use the following AWS services with AWS Resource Groups.

AWS serviceUsing with Resource Groups

[AWS CloudFormation](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide.md)
– Create resource groups in CloudFormation by using a stack
template.

Provision and organize AWS resources at the same time. Organize
resources by tags. Organize resources from another stack. Gather
insights on your AWS resources in resource groups using Amazon CloudWatch or
take operational actions using AWS Systems Manager.

For more information, see [ResourceGroups\
resource type reference](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/aws-resourcegroups.md) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

[CloudTrail](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide.md)
– Capture all resource group actions using AWS CloudTrail.

Capture information about actions performed on your resource groups
including details like who performed the action (IAM principal, such
as a role, user, or an AWS service), when the action was performed,
where the action occurred (the source IP address) and more. These
records can then be used for analysis or to trigger follow-up
actions.

For more information, see [Viewing events with\
CloudTrail Event history](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.md).

[Amazon CloudWatch](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/whatiscloudwatch.md) – Enable real-time monitoring of your AWS
resources and the applications you run on AWS.

Focus your view to display metrics and alarms from a single resource
group.

For more information, see [Focus on metrics and alarms in a resource group](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-automatic-dashboards-resource-group.md) in the
_Amazon CloudWatch User Guide._

[Amazon CloudWatch application\
insights](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/appinsights-what-is.md) – Detect common problems with your .NET and
SQL Server-based applications.

Monitor your .NET and SQL Server application resources that belong to
a resource group.

For more information, see [Supported application components](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/appinsights-what-is.md#appinsights-components) in the
_Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

[Amazon DynamoDB table groups](../../../dynamodb/latest/developerguide/introduction.md) – Organize your DynamoDB tables
into logical groupings so you can more easily manage your resources.

Create, edit, and delete groups of DynamoDB tables from the DynamoDB
**Action** menu.

For more information, see the [_Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide._](../../../dynamodb/latest/developerguide/introduction.md)

[Amazon EC2 dedicated\
hosts](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/dedicated-hosts-overview.md) – Use your existing per-socket, per-core, or
per-VM software licenses, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL
Server, SUSE, and Linux Enterprise Server.

Launch Amazon EC2 instances into host resource groups to help maximize your
utilization of Dedicated Hosts.

For more information, see [Working with\
dedicated hosts](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/how-dedicated-hosts-work.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide._

[Amazon EC2 capacity\
reservations](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-capacity-reservations.md) – Reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances
to be used when you need it. You can specify attributes for the capacity
reservation so that it only works with Amazon EC2 instances that launch with
matching attributes.

Launch your Amazon EC2 instances into resource groups that contain one or
more capacity reservations. If the group doesn't have a capacity
reservation with matching attributes and available capacity for a
requested instance, the instance runs as an on-demand instance. If you
later add a matching capacity reservation to the targeted group, the
instance is automatically matched with and moved into the reserved
capacity.

For more information, see [Work with Capacity Reservation groups](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/capacity-reservations-using.md#create-cr-group) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide._

[AWS License Manager](../../../license-manager/latest/userguide/license-manager.md) – Streamline the process of bringing
software vendor licenses to the cloud.

Configure a host resource group to enable License Manager to manage your
Dedicated Hosts.

For more information, see [Host Resource Groups\
in License Manager](../../../license-manager/latest/userguide/host-resource-groups.md) in the
_License Manager User Guide._

[AWS Resilience Hub](../../../resilience-hub/latest/userguide.md) – Prepare and protect your applications
from disruptions.

Discover your applications that are defined using Resource
Groups.

For more information, see [Measure and Improve Your Application Resilience with\
AWS Resilience Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/monitor-and-improve-your-application-resiliency-with-resilience-hub) in the _AWS News Blog_.

[AWS Resource Access Manager](../../../ram/latest/userguide.md)
– Share specified AWS resources that you own with other
accounts.

Share host resource groups using AWS RAM.

For more information, see [Shareable\
resources](../../../ram/latest/userguide/shareable.md#shareable-arg) in the _AWS RAM User Guide._

[AWS Service Catalog AppRegistry](../../../servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/appregistry.md) – Define and manage your applications and
their metadata.

When you create an application in AppRegistry, that service automatically
creates an resource group for that application. The application resource
group is a collection of all of the resources in your application. The
service also creates a CloudFormation stack-based resource group for every stack
associated with the application.

For more information, see [Using\
AppRegistry](../../../servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/appregistry.md) in the _AWS Service Catalog_
_Administrator Guide_.

[AWS Systems Manager](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.md)
– Enable visibility and control of your AWS resources.

Gather operational insights and take bulk actions on your applications
that are based on resource groups. In the AWS Systems Manager console, the
Application Manager **Custom applications** page
automatically imports and displays operations data for applications that
are based on resource groups. You can use the information in Application
Manager to help you determine which resources in an application are
compliant and working correctly and which resources require
action.

For more information, see [Working with applications in Application Manager](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/application-manager-working-applications.md) in the
_AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

[Amazon VPC Network Access Analyzer](../../../vpc/latest/network-access-analyzer.md) – Identify unwanted
network access to your resources on AWS.

You can specify the sources and destinations for your network access
requirements by using AWS Resource Groups. This lets you govern network access
across your AWS environment, independent of how you configure your
network.

For more information, see [Use\
Resource Groups with Network Access Scopes](../../../vpc/latest/network-access-analyzer/working-with-network-access-scopes.md) in the
_Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.
