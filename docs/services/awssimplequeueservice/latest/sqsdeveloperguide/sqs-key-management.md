# Amazon SQS Key management

Amazon SQS integrates with the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage [KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys) for server-side
encryption (SSE). See [Encryption at rest in Amazon SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html) for SSE information and key
management definitions. Amazon SQS uses KMS keys to validate and secure the data keys
that encrypt and decrypt the messages. The following sections provide information
about working with KMS keys and data keys in the Amazon SQS service.

## Configuring AWS KMS permissions

Every KMS key must have a key policy. Note that you cannot modify the key
policy of an AWS managed KMS key for Amazon SQS. The policy for this KMS key
includes permissions for all principals in the account (that are authorized to
use Amazon SQS) to use encrypted queues.

Amazon SQS distinguishes between callers based on their AWS credentials,
whether they are using different AWS accounts, IAM users, or IAM roles.
Additionally, the same IAM role with different scoping policies will be treated as
distinct requesters. However, when using IAM role sessions,
varying only the `RoleSessionName` while keeping the same IAM role
and scoping policies will not create distinct requesters.
Therefore, when specifying AWS KMS key policy principals,
avoid relying on `RoleSessionName` differences alone,
as these sessions will be treated as the same requester.

Alternatively, you can specify the required permissions in an IAM policy
assigned to the principals that produce and consume encrypted messages. For more
information, see [Using IAM\
Policies with AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/iam-policies.html) in the
_AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

###### Note

While you can configure global permissions to send to and receive from
Amazon SQS, AWS KMS requires explicitly naming the full ARN of KMS keys in
specific regions in the `Resource` section of an IAM
policy.

### Configure KMS permissions for AWS services

Several AWS services act as event sources that can send events to Amazon SQS
queues. To allow these event sources to work with encrypted queues, you must
create a customer managed KMS key and add permissions in the key policy
for the service to use the required AWS KMS API methods. Perform the following
steps to configure the permissions.

###### Warning

When changing the KMS key for encrypting your Amazon SQS messages, be aware
that existing messages encrypted with the old KMS key will remain
encrypted with that key. To decrypt these messages, you must retain the
old KMS key and ensure that its key policy grants Amazon SQS the permissions
for `kms:Decrypt` and
`kms:GenerateDataKey`. After updating
to a new KMS key for encrypting new messages, ensure all existing
messages encrypted with the old KMS key are processed and removed from
the queue before deleting or disabling the old KMS key.

1. Create a customer managed KMS key. For more information, see
    [Creating Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html)
    in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

2. To allow the AWS service event source to use the
    `kms:Decrypt` and
    `kms:GenerateDataKey` API methods, add the following
    statement to the KMS key policy.
JSON

```json

{
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
               "Service": "service.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": [
               "kms:Decrypt",
               "kms:GenerateDataKey"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
          }]
}

```

Replace "service" in the above example with the _Service_
_name_ of the event source. Event sources include the
    following services.

Event sourceService name[Amazon CloudWatch Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/Create-CloudWatch-Events-Rule.html)`events.amazonaws.com`[Amazon S3 event notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/NotificationHowTo.html)`s3.amazonaws.com`[Amazon SNS topic subscriptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-tutorial-create-subscribe-endpoint-to-topic.html)`sns.amazonaws.com`

3. [Configure an\
    existing SSE queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-configure-sse-existing-queue.html) using the ARN of your
    KMS key.

4. Provide the ARN of the encrypted queue to the event source.

### Configure AWS KMS permissions for producers

When the [data\
key reuse period](#sqs-how-does-the-data-key-reuse-period-work) expires, the producer's next call to
`SendMessage` or `SendMessageBatch` also triggers
calls to `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey`. The
call to `kms:Decrypt` is to verify the integrity of the new data
key before using it. Therefore, the producer must have the
`kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey`
permissions for the KMS key.

Add the following statement to the IAM policy of the producer. Remember to
use the correct ARN values for the key resource and the queue
resource.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:GenerateDataKey"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/111112222233333"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sqs:SendMessage"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:*:123456789012:MyQueue"
        }
    ]
}

```

### Configure AWS KMS permissions for consumers

When the data key reuse period expires, the consumer's next call to
`ReceiveMessage` also triggers a call to
`kms:Decrypt`, to verify the integrity of the new data key
before using it. Therefore, the consumer must have the
`kms:Decrypt` permission for any KMS key that is used to
encrypt the messages in the specified queue. If the queue acts as a [dead-letter queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html), the consumer
must also have the `kms:Decrypt` permission for any KMS key
that is used to encrypt the messages in the source queue. Add the following
statement to the IAM policy of the consumer. Remember to use the correct ARN
values for the key resource and the queue resource.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Decrypt"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/111112222233333"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sqs:ReceiveMessage"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:*:123456789012:MyQueue"
        }
    ]
}

```

### Configure AWS KMS permissions with confused deputy protection

When the principal in a key policy statement is an [AWS service principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html#principal-services), you can use the [`aws:SourceArn`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourcearn) or [`aws:SourceAccount`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourceaccount) global condition keys to
protect against the [confused deputy\
scenario](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html). To use these condition keys, set the value to the
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that is being encrypted. If you
don't know the ARN of the resource, use `aws:SourceAccount`
instead.

In this KMS key policy, a specific resource from _service_ that is owned by account `111122223333`
is allowed to call KMS for `Decrypt` and
`GenerateDataKey` actions, which occur during SSE usage of
Amazon SQS.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "sqs.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": [
                "kms:GenerateDataKey",
                "kms:Decrypt"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": [
                        "arn:aws:sqs:us-west-1:111122223333:resource"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

When using SSE enabled Amazon SQS queues, the following services support
`aws:SourceArn`:

- Amazon SNS

- Amazon S3

- CloudWatch Events

- AWS Lambda

- CodeBuild

- Amazon Connect Customer Profiles

- AWS Auto Scaling

- Amazon Chime

## Understanding the data key reuse period

The [data key reuse period](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-sse-key-terms) defines
the maximum duration for Amazon SQS to reuse the same data key. When the data key
reuse period ends, Amazon SQS generates a new data key. Note the following guidelines
about the reuse period.

- A shorter reuse period provides better security but results in more
calls to AWS KMS, which might incur charges beyond the Free Tier.

- Although the data key is cached separately for encryption and for
decryption, the reuse period applies to both copies of the data
key.

- When the data key reuse period ends, the next call to
`SendMessage` or `SendMessageBatch` typically
triggers a call to the AWS KMS `GenerateDataKey` method to get
a new data key. Also, the next calls to `SendMessage` and
`ReceiveMessage` will each trigger a call to AWS KMS
`Decrypt` to verify the integrity of the data key before
using it.

- [Principals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html#Principal) (AWS accounts or users) don't share data keys
(messages sent by unique principals always get unique data keys).
Therefore, the volume of calls to AWS KMS is a multiple of the number of
unique principals in use during the data key reuse period.

## Estimating AWS KMS costs

To predict costs and better understand your AWS bill, you might want to know
how often Amazon SQS uses your KMS key.

###### Note

Although the following formula can give you a very good idea of expected
costs, actual costs might be higher because of the distributed nature of
Amazon SQS.

To calculate the number of API requests ( `R`) _per_
_queue_, use the following formula:

```

R = (B / D) * (2 * P + C)
```

`B` is the billing period (in seconds).

`D` is the [data key reuse\
period](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html#sqs-sse-key-terms) (in seconds).

`P` is the number of producing [principals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html#Principal) that send to the Amazon SQS queue.

`C` is the number of consuming principals that receive from the
Amazon SQS queue.

###### Important

In general, producing principals incur double the cost of consuming
principals. For more information, see [Understanding the data key reuse period](#sqs-how-does-the-data-key-reuse-period-work).

If the producer and consumer have different users, the cost
increases.

The following are example calculations. For exact pricing information, see
[AWS Key Management Service Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing).

### Example 1: Calculating the number of AWS KMS API calls for 2 principals and 1 queue

This example assumes the following:

- The billing period is January 1-31 (2,678,400 seconds).

- The data key reuse period is set to 5 minutes (300
seconds).

- There is 1 queue.

- There is 1 producing principal and 1 consuming principal.

```

(2,678,400 / 300) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 26,784
```

### Example 2: Calculating the number of AWS KMS API calls for multiple producers and consumers and 2 queues

This example assumes the following:

- The billing period is February 1-28 (2,419,200 seconds).

- The data key reuse period is set to 24 hours (86,400
seconds).

- There are 2 queues.

- The first queue has 3 producing principals and 1 consuming
principal.

- The second queue has 5 producing principals and 2 consuming
principals.

```

(2,419,200 / 86,400 * (2 * 3 + 1)) + (2,419,200 / 86,400 * (2 * 5 + 2)) = 532
```
