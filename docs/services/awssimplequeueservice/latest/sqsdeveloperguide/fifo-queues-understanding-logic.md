# FIFO queue delivery logic in Amazon SQS

The following concepts clarify how Amazon SQS FIFO queues handle the sending and receiving
of messages, particularly when dealing with message ordering and message group
IDs.

## Sending messages

Amazon SQS FIFO queues preserve message order using unique deduplication IDs and
message group IDs. This topic highlights the importance of message group IDs for
maintaining strict ordering within groups and highlights best practices for ensuring
reliable, ordered message delivery across multiple producers.

1. **Order preservation**

- When multiple messages are sent in succession to a FIFO queue with
unique message deduplication IDs, Amazon SQS stores them and acknowledges
their transmission. These messages are then received and processed
in the exact order they were transmitted.

2. **Message group ID**

- In FIFO queues, messages are ordered based on their message group
ID. If multiple producers or threads send messages with the same
message group ID, Amazon SQS ensures they are stored and processed in the
order they arrive.

- Best practice: To guarantee strict message order across multiple
producers, assign a unique message group ID for all messages from
each producer.

3. **Per-group ordering**

- **FIFO queue logic applies on a per message**
**group ID basis:**

- Each message group ID represents a distinct, ordered group
of messages.

- Within a message group ID, all messages are sent and
received in strict order.

- Messages with different message group IDs may arrive or be
processed out of order relative to one another.

- **Requirement** \- You must associate
a message group ID with each message. If a message is sent without a
group ID, the action fails.

- **Single group scenario** \- If you
require all messages to be processed in strict order, use the same
message group ID for every message.

## Receiving messages

Amazon SQS FIFO queues handle message retrieval, including batch processing, FIFO order
guarantees, and limitations on requesting specific message group IDs. This topic
explains how Amazon SQS retrieves messages within and across message group IDs while
maintaining strict ordering and visibility rules.

1. **Batch retrieval**

- When receiving messages from a FIFO queue with multiple message
group IDs, Amazon SQS:

- Attempts to return as many messages as possible with the
same message group ID in a single call.

- Allows other consumers to process messages from different
message group IDs concurrently.

- **Important clarification**

- You may receive multiple messages from the same message
group ID in one batch (up to 10 messages in a single call
using the `MaxNumberOfMessages`
parameter).

- However, you can't receive additional messages from the
same message group ID in subsequent requests until:

- The currently received messages are deleted,
or

- They become visible again (for example, after the
visibility timeout expires).

2. **FIFO order guarantee**

- Messages retrieved in a batch retain their FIFO order within the
group.

- If fewer than 10 messages are available for the same message group
ID, Amazon SQS may include messages from other message group IDs in the
same batch, but each group retains FIFO order.

3. **Consumer limitations**

- You cannot explicitly request to receive messages from a specific
message group ID.

## Retrying multiple times

Producers and consumers can safely retry failed actions in Amazon SQS FIFO queues
without disrupting message order or introducing duplicates. This topic highlights
how deduplication IDs and visibility timeouts ensure message integrity during
retries.

1. **Producer retries**

- If a [`SendMessage`](../../../../reference/awssimplequeueservice/latest/apireference/api-sendmessage.md) action fails, the producer
can retry sending the message multiple times with the same message
deduplication ID.

- As long as the producer receives at least one acknowledgment
before the deduplication interval expires, retries:

- Do not introduce duplicate messages.

- Do not disrupt message order.

2. **Consumer retries**

- If a [`ReceiveMessage`](../../../../reference/awssimplequeueservice/latest/apireference/api-receivemessage.md) action fails, the
consumer can retry as many times as necessary using the same receive
request attempt ID.

- As long as the consumer receives at least one acknowledgment
before the visibility timeout expires, retries:

- Do not disrupt message order.

## Additional notes on FIFO behavior

Learn about handling visibility timeouts, enabling parallel processing with
multiple message group IDs, and ensuring strict sequential processing in
single-group scenarios.

1. **Handling visibility timeout**

- When a message is retrieved but not deleted, it remains invisible
until the visibility timeout expires.

- No additional messages from the same message group ID are returned
until the first message is deleted or becomes visible again.

2. **Concurrency and parallel**
**processing**

- FIFO queues allow parallel processing of messages across different
message group IDs.

- To maximize concurrency, design your system with multiple message
group IDs for independent workflows.

3. **Single group scenarios**

- For strict sequential processing of all messages in a FIFO queue,
use a single message group ID for all messages in the queue.

## Examples for better understanding

The following are practical scenarios illustrating FIFO queue behavior in
Amazon SQS.

1. **Scenario 1: Single group ID**

- A producer sends five messages with the same message group ID
Group A.

- A consumer receives these messages in FIFO order. Until the
consumer deletes these messages or the visibility timeout expires,
no additional messages from Group A are received.

2. **Scenario 2: Multiple group IDs**

- A producer sends five messages to Group A and 5 to Group B.

- Consumer 1 processes messages from Group A, while Consumer 2
processes messages from Group B. This enables parallel processing
with strict ordering maintained within each group.

3. **Scenario 3: Batch retrieval**

- A producer sends seven messages to Group A and three to Group
B.

- A single consumer retrieves up to 10 messages. If the queue
allows, it may return:

- Seven messages from Group A and three from Group B (or
fewer if fewer messages are available from a single
group).
