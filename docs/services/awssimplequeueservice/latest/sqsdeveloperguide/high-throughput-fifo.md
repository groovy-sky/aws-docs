# High throughput for FIFO queues in Amazon SQS

High throughput FIFO queues in Amazon SQS efficiently manage high message throughput while
maintaining strict message order, ensuring reliability and scalability for applications
processing numerous messages. This solution is ideal for scenarios demanding both high
throughput and ordered message delivery.

Amazon SQS high throughput FIFO queues are not necessary in scenarios where strict message
ordering is not crucial and where the volume of incoming messages is relatively low or sporadic.
For instance, if you have a small-scale application that processes infrequent or non-sequential
messages, the added complexity and cost associated with high throughput FIFO queues may not be
justified. Additionally, if your application does not require the enhanced throughput
capabilities provided by high throughput FIFO queues, opting for a standard Amazon SQS queue might be
more cost-effective and simpler to manage.

To enhance request capacity in high throughput FIFO queues, increasing the number of message
groups is recommended. For more information on high throughput message quotas, see [Amazon SQS service\
quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sqs-service.html#limits_sqs.html) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

For information per-queue quotas and data distribution strategies, see [Amazon SQS message quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-messages.html) and [Partitions and data distribution for high throughput for SQS FIFO queues](#partitions-and-data-distribution).

## Use cases for high throughput for Amazon SQS FIFO queues

The following use cases highlight the diverse applications of high throughput FIFO queues,
showcasing their effectiveness across industries and scenarios:

1. **Real-time data processing:** Applications dealing with
    real-time data streams, such as event processing or telemetry data ingestion, can benefit
    from high throughput FIFO queues to handle the continuous influx of messages while
    preserving their order for accurate analysis.

2. **E-commerce order processing:** In e-commerce platforms
    where maintaining the order of customer transactions is critical, high throughput FIFO
    queues ensure that orders are processed sequentially and without delays, even during peak
    shopping seasons.

3. **Financial services:** Financial institutions handling
    high-frequency trading or transactional data rely on high throughput FIFO Queues to process
    market data and transactions with minimal latency while adhering to strict regulatory
    requirements for message ordering.

4. **Media streaming:** Streaming platforms and media
    distribution services utilize high throughput FIFO queues to manage the delivery of media
    files and streaming content, ensuring smooth playback experiences for users while
    maintaining the correct order of content delivery.

## Partitions and data distribution for high throughput for SQS FIFO queues

Amazon SQS stores FIFO queue data in partitions. A _partition_ is an
allocation of storage for a queue that is automatically replicated across multiple Availability
Zones within an AWS Region. You don't manage partitions. Instead, Amazon SQS handles partition
management.

For FIFO queues, Amazon SQS modifies the number of partitions in a queue in the following
situations:

- If the current request rate approaches or exceeds what the existing partitions can
support, additional partitions are allocated until the queue reaches the regional quota. For
information on quotas, see [Amazon SQS message quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-messages.html).

- If the current partitions have low utilization, the number of partitions may be
reduced.

Partition management occurs automatically in the background and is transparent to your
applications. Your queue and messages are available at all times.

### Distributing data by message group IDs

To add a message to a FIFO queue, Amazon SQS uses the value of each message’s message group ID
as input to an internal hash function. The output value from the hash function determines
which partition stores the message.

The following diagram shows a queue that spans multiple partitions. The queue’s message
group ID is based on item number. Amazon SQS uses its hash function to determine where to store a
new item; in this case, it's based on the hash value of the string `item0`. Note
that the items are stored in the same order in which they are added to the queue. Each item's
location is determined by the hash value of its message group ID.

###### Note

Amazon SQS is optimized for uniform distribution of items across a FIFO queue's partitions,
regardless of the number of partitions. AWS recommends that you use message group IDs that
can have a large number of distinct values.

### Optimizing partition utilization

Each partition supports up to 3,000 messages per second with batching, or up to 300
messages per second for send, receive, and delete operations in supported regions. For more
information on high throughput message quotas,
see [Amazon SQS service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sqs-service.html#limits_sqs.html)
in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

When using batch APIs, each message is routed based on the process described in
[Distributing data by message group IDs](#data-distribution-message-group-id).
Messages that are routed to the same partition are grouped and processed in a single transaction.

To optimize partition utilization for the `SendMessageBatch` API, AWS recommends batching
messages with the same message group IDs when possible.

To optimize partition utilization for the `DeleteMessageBatch` and
`ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch` APIs, AWS recommends using
`ReceiveMessage` requests with the `MaxNumberOfMessages` parameter set
to 10, and batching the receipt-handles returned by a single `ReceiveMessage`
request.

In the following example, a batch of messages with various message group IDs is sent. The
batch is split into three groups, each of which counts against the quota for the
partition.

![A batch of messages with different message group IDs is stored in partitions.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/fifo-documentation-batch.png)

###### Note

Amazon SQS only guarantees that messages with the same message group ID's internal hash
function are grouped within a batch request. Depending on the output of the internal hash
function and the number of partitions, messages with different message group IDs might be
grouped. Since the hash function or number of partitions can change at any time, messages
that are grouped at one point may not be grouped later.
