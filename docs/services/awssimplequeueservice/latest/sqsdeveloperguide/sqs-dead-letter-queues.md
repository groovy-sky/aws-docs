# Using dead-letter queues in Amazon SQS

Amazon SQS supports dead-letter queues (DLQs), which source queues can target for messages that
are not processed successfully. DLQs are useful for debugging your application because you
can isolate unconsumed messages to determine why processing did not succeed. For optimal
performance, it is a best practice to keep the source queue and DLQ within the same
AWS account and Region. Once messages are in a dead-letter queue, you can:

- Examine logs for exceptions that might have caused messages to be moved to a
dead-letter queue.

- Analyze the contents of messages moved to the dead-letter queue to diagnose
application issues.

- Determine whether you have given your consumer sufficient time to process
messages.

- Move messages out of the dead-letter queue using [dead-letter queue\
redrive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-configure-dead-letter-queue.html).

You must first create a new queue before configuring it as a dead-letter queue. For
information about configuring a dead-letter queue using the Amazon SQS console, see [Configure a dead-letter queue using the Amazon SQS console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-configure-dead-letter-queue.html). For help with dead-letter queues,
such as how to configure an alarm for any messages moved to a dead-letter queue, see [Creating alarms for dead-letter queues using Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/dead-letter-queues-alarms-cloudwatch.html).

###### Note

Don't use a dead-letter queue with a FIFO queue if you don't want to break the exact
order of messages or operations. For example, don't use a dead-letter queue with
instructions in an Edit Decision List (EDL) for a video editing suite, where changing
the order of edits changes the context of subsequent edits.

## Using policies for dead-letter queues

Use a **redrive policy** to specify the
`maxReceiveCount`. The `maxReceiveCount` is the number of
times a consumer can receive a message from a source queue before it is moved to a
dead-letter queue. For example, if the `maxReceiveCount` is set to a low
value such as 1, one failure to receive a message would cause the message to move to the
dead-letter queue. To ensure that your system is resilient against errors, set the
`maxReceiveCount` high enough to allow for sufficient retries.

For standard queues with a redrive policy where `maxReceiveCount` is greater
than 3, if a message is received 3 or more times without being deleted, SQS moves it to
the back of the queue. The `ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` metric then reflects
the age of the next message that hasn’t exceeded this threshold.

The **redrive allow policy** specifies which source
queues can access the dead-letter queue. You can choose whether to allow all source
queues, allow specific source queues, or deny all source queues use of the dead-letter
queue. The default allows all source queues to use the dead-letter queue. If you choose
to allow specific queues using the `byQueue` option, you can specify up to 10
source queues using the source queue Amazon Resource Name (ARN). If you specify
`denyAll`, the queue cannot be used as a dead-letter queue.

## Understanding message retention periods for dead-letter queues

For standard queues, the expiration of a message is always based on its original
enqueue timestamp. When a message is moved to a dead-letter queue, the enqueue timestamp
is unchanged. The `ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` metric indicates when the
message moved to the dead-letter queue, not when the message was originally sent. For
example, assume that a message spends 1 day in the original queue before it's moved to a
dead-letter queue. If the dead-letter queue's retention period is 4 days, the message is
deleted from the dead-letter queue after 3 days and the
`ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` is 3 days. Thus, it is a best practice to
always set the retention period of a dead-letter queue to be longer than the retention
period of the original queue.

For FIFO queues, the enqueue timestamp resets when the message is moved to a
dead-letter queue. The `ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` metric indicates when
the message moved to the dead-letter queue. In the same example above, the message is
deleted from the dead-letter queue after four days and the
`ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` is four days.
