# Tutorial: Sending a message to an Amazon SQS queue from Amazon Virtual Private Cloud

This tutorial shows you how to send messages to an Amazon SQS queue over a secure, private
network. The network includes:

- A VPC containing an Amazon EC2 instance.

- An interface VPC endpoint, which allows the Amazon EC2 instance to connect to Amazon SQS
without using the public internet.

Even in a fully private network, you can connect to the Amazon EC2 instance and send messages
to the Amazon SQS queue. For more information, see [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud endpoints for Amazon SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-internetwork-traffic-privacy.html#sqs-vpc-endpoints).

###### Important

- You can use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud only with HTTPS Amazon SQS endpoints.

- When you configure Amazon SQS to send messages from Amazon VPC, you must enable private DNS and
specify endpoints in the format
`sqs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com` or `sqs.us-east-2.api.aws` for the dual-stack endpoint.

- Amazon SQS also supports FIPS endpoints through PrivateLink using the `com.amazonaws.region.sqs-fips` endpoint service. You can connect to FIPS endpoints in the format `sqs-fips.region.amazonaws.com`.

- When using the dual-stack endpoint in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, requests will be sent using IPv4 and IPv6.

- Private DNS doesn't support legacy endpoints such as
`queue.amazonaws.com` or
`us-east-2.queue.amazonaws.com`.

## Step 1: Create an Amazon EC2 key pair

A _key pair_ lets you connect to an Amazon EC2 instance.
It consists of a public key that encrypts your login information and a private key that
decrypts it.

1. Sign in to the [Amazon EC2\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. On the navigation menu, under **Network & Security**,
    choose **Key Pairs**.

3. Choose **Create Key Pair**.

4. In the **Create Key Pair** dialog box, for **Key pair**
**name**, enter `SQS-VPCE-Tutorial-Key-Pair`, and then
    choose **Create**.

5. Your browser downloads the private key file
    `SQS-VPCE-Tutorial-Key-Pair.pem` automatically.

###### Important

Save this file in a safe place. EC2 does not generate a `.pem`
file for the same key pair a second time.

6. To allow an SSH client to connect to your EC2 instance, set the permissions
    for your private key file so that only your user can have read permissions for
    it, for example:

```bsh

chmod 400 SQS-VPCE-Tutorial-Key-Pair.pem
```

## Step 2: Create AWS resources

To set up the necessary infrastructure, you must use an CloudFormation _template_, which is a blueprint for creating a _stack_
comprised of AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon SQS queues.

The stack for this tutorial includes the following resources:

- A VPC and the associated networking resources, including a subnet, a security
group, an internet gateway, and a route table

- An Amazon EC2 instance launched into the VPC subnet

- An Amazon SQS queue

1. Download the CloudFormation template named [`SQS-VPCE-Tutorial-CloudFormation.yaml`](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sqs-samples/blob/master/templates/SQS-VPCE-Tutorial-CloudFormation.yaml) from
    GitHub.

2. Sign in to the [CloudFormation\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

3. Choose **Create Stack**.

4. On the **Select Template** page, choose **Upload a**
**template to Amazon S3**, select the
    `SQS-VPCE-SQS-Tutorial-CloudFormation.yaml` file, and then choose
    **Next**.

5. On the **Specify Details** page, do the following:
1. For **Stack name**, enter
       `SQS-VPCE-Tutorial-Stack`.

2. For **KeyName**, choose
       **SQS-VPCE-Tutorial-Key-Pair**.

3. Choose **Next**.
6. On the **Options** page, choose
    **Next**.

7. On the **Review** page, in the
    **Capabilities** section, choose **I**
**acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom**
**names.**, and then choose **Create**.

CloudFormation begins to create the stack and displays the
**CREATE\_IN\_PROGRESS** status. When the process is complete, CloudFormation
displays the **CREATE\_COMPLETE** status.

## Step 3: Confirm that your EC2 instance isn't publicly accessible

Your CloudFormation template launches an EC2 instance named
`SQS-VPCE-Tutorial-EC2-Instance` into your VPC. This EC2 instance doesn't
allow outbound traffic and isn't able to send messages to Amazon SQS. To verify this, you
must connect to the instance, try to connect to a public endpoint, and then try to
message Amazon SQS.

01. Sign in to the [Amazon EC2\
     console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

02. On the navigation menu, under **Instances**, choose
     **Instances**.

03. Select **SQS-VPCE-Tutorial-EC2Instance**.

04. Copy the hostname under **Public DNS**, for example,
     **ec2-203-0-113-0.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com**.

05. From the directory that contains [the key\
     pair that you created earlier](#create-ec2-key-pair), connect to the instance using the
     following command, for example:

    ```bsh

    ssh -i SQS-VPCE-Tutorial-Key-Pair.pem ec2-user@ec2-203-0-113-0.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
    ```

06. Try to connect to any public endpoint, for example:

    ```bsh

    ping amazon.com
    ```

    The connection attempt fails, as expected.

07. Sign in to the [Amazon SQS\
     console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs).

08. From the list of queues, select the queue created by your CloudFormation template, for
     example,
     **VPCE-SQS-Tutorial-Stack-CFQueue-1ABCDEFGH2IJK**.

09. On the **Details** table, copy the URL, for example,
     **https://sqs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/123456789012/**.

10. From your EC2 instance, try to publish a message to the queue using the
     following command, for example:

    ```bsh

    aws sqs send-message --region us-east-2 --endpoint-url https://sqs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ --queue-url https://sqs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/123456789012/ --message-body "Hello from Amazon SQS."
    ```

    The sending attempt fails, as expected.

    ###### Important

    Later, when you create a VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS, your sending attempt will
    succeed.

## Step 4: Create an Amazon VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS

To connect your VPC to Amazon SQS, you must define an interface VPC endpoint. After you add
the endpoint, you can use the Amazon SQS API from the EC2 instance in your VPC. This allows
you to send messages to a queue within the AWS network without crossing the public
internet.

###### Note

The EC2 instance still doesn't have access to other AWS services and endpoints
on the internet.

1. Sign in to the [Amazon VPC\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. On the navigation menu, choose **Endpoints**.

3. Choose **Create Endpoint**.

4. On the **Create Endpoint** page, for **Service**
**Name**, choose the service name for Amazon SQS.

###### Note

The service names vary based on the current AWS Region. For example, if
you are in US East (Ohio), the service name is
**com.amazonaws. `us-east-2`.sqs**.

5. For **VPC**, choose
    **SQS-VPCE-Tutorial-VPC**.

6. For **Subnets**, choose the subnet whose **Subnet**
**ID** contains **SQS-VPCE-Tutorial-Subnet**.

7. For **Security group**, choose **Select security**
**groups**, and then choose the security group whose **Group**
**Name** contains **SQS VPCE Tutorial Security**
**Group**.

8. Choose **Create endpoint**.

The interface VPC endpoint is created and its ID is displayed, for example,
    **vpce-0ab1cdef2ghi3j456k**.

9. Choose **Close**.

The Amazon VPC console opens the **Endpoints** page.

Amazon VPC begins to create the endpoint and displays the **pending**
status. When the process is complete, Amazon VPC displays the **available**
status.

## Step 5: Send a message to your Amazon SQS queue

Now that your VPC includes an endpoint for Amazon SQS, you can connect to your EC2 instance
and send messages to your queue.

1. Reconnect to your EC2 instance, for example:

```bsh

ssh -i SQS-VPCE-Tutorial-Key-Pair.pem ec2-user@ec2-203-0-113-0.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

2. Try to publish a message to the queue again using the following command, for
    example:

```bsh

aws sqs send-message --region us-east-2 --endpoint-url https://sqs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ --queue-url https://sqs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/123456789012/ --message-body "Hello from Amazon SQS."
```

The sending attempt succeeds and the MD5 digest of the message body and the
    message ID are displayed, for example:

```json

{
   	"MD5OfMessageBody": "a1bcd2ef3g45hi678j90klmn12p34qr5",
   	"MessageId": "12345a67-8901-2345-bc67-d890123e45fg"
}
```

your CloudFormation template (for example,
