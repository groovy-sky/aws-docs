# Amazon SQS access control process workflow

The following diagram describes the general workflow of access control with
the Amazon SQS access policy language.

![Figure one in the previous diagram.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/number-1-red.png) You write an Amazon SQS policy for your queue.

![Figure two in the previous diagram.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/number-2-red.png) You upload your policy to AWS. The AWS service provides
an API that you use to upload your policies. For example, you use the Amazon SQS
`SetQueueAttributes` action to upload a policy for a particular
Amazon SQS queue.

![Figure three in the previous diagram.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/number-3-red.png) Someone sends a request to use your Amazon SQS queue.

![Figure four in the previous diagram.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/number-4-red.png) Amazon SQS examines all available Amazon SQS policies and determines
which ones are applicable.

![Figure five in the previous diagram.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/number-5-red.png) Amazon SQS evaluates the policies and determines whether the
requester is allowed to use your queue.

![Figure six in the previous diagram.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/number-6-red.png) Based on the policy evaluation result, Amazon SQS either returns
an `Access denied` error to the requester or continues to process the
request.
