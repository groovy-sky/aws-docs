# Making query API requests using AWS query protocol in Amazon SQS

This topic explains how to construct an Amazon SQS endpoint, make GET and POST requests, and
interpret responses.

## Constructing an endpoint

In order to work with Amazon SQS queues, you must construct an endpoint. For information
about Amazon SQS endpoints, see the following pages in the
_Amazon Web Services General Reference_:

- [Regional endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sqs_region)

- [Amazon Simple Queue Service endpoints and\
quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sqs-service)

Every Amazon SQS endpoint is independent. For example, if two queues are named _MyQueue_ and one has the endpoint
`sqs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com` while the other has the endpoint
`sqs.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com`, the two queues don't share any data with each
other.

The following is an example of an endpoint which makes a request to create a queue.

```nohighlight

https://sqs.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/
?Action=CreateQueue
&DefaultVisibilityTimeout=40
&QueueName=MyQueue
&Version=2012-11-05
&AUTHPARAMS
```

###### Note

Queue names and queue URLs are case sensitive.

The structure of `AUTHPARAMS` depends on the signature of the API request.
For more information, see [Signing AWS API Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html)
in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

## Making a GET request

An Amazon SQS GET request is structured as a URL which consists of the following:

- **Endpoint** – The resource that the
request is acting on (the [queue name and URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-message-identifiers.html#queue-name-url)), for example:
`https://sqs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/123456789012/MyQueue`

- **Action** – The [action](../../../../reference/awssimplequeueservice/latest/apireference/api-operations.md) that you want to
perform on the endpoint. A question mark ( `?`) separates the endpoint
from the action, for example:
`?Action=SendMessage&MessageBody=Your%20Message%20Text`

- **Parameters** – Any request parameters.
Each parameter is separated by an ampersand ( `&`), for example:
`&Version=2012-11-05&AUTHPARAMS`

The following is an example of a GET request that sends a message to an Amazon SQS
queue.

```nohighlight

https://sqs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/123456789012/MyQueue
?Action=SendMessage&MessageBody=Your%20message%20text
&Version=2012-11-05
&AUTHPARAMS
```

###### Note

Queue names and queue URLs are case sensitive.

Because GET requests are URLs, you must URL-encode all parameter values. Because
spaces aren't allowed in URLs, each space is URL-encoded as `%20`. The
rest of the example isn't URL-encoded to make it easier to read.

## Making a POST request

An Amazon SQS POST request sends query parameters as a form in the body of an HTTP
request.

The following is an example of an HTTP header with `Content-Type` set to
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

```nohighlight

POST /123456789012/MyQueue HTTP/1.1
Host: sqs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

The header is followed by a `form-urlencoded` GET request that sends a message to an Amazon SQS
queue. Each parameter is separated by an ampersand ( `&`).

```nohighlight

Action=SendMessage
&MessageBody=Your+Message+Text
&Expires=2020-10-15T12%3A00%3A00Z
&Version=2012-11-05
&AUTHPARAMS
```

###### Note

Only the `Content-Type` HTTP header is required. The
`AUTHPARAMS` is the same as for the
GET request.

Your HTTP client might add other items to the HTTP request, according to the
client's HTTP version.
