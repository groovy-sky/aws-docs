# Amazon SQS standard queues

Amazon SQS provides standard queues as the default queue type, supporting a nearly unlimited
number of API calls per second for actions like [`SendMessage`](../../../../reference/awssimplequeueservice/latest/apireference/api-sendmessage.md), [`ReceiveMessage`](../../../../reference/awssimplequeueservice/latest/apireference/api-receivemessage.md), and [`DeleteMessage`](../../../../reference/awssimplequeueservice/latest/apireference/api-deletemessage.md). Standard queues ensure at-least-once message
delivery, but due to the highly distributed architecture, more than one copy of a message
might be delivered, and messages may occasionally arrive out of order. Despite this,
standard queues make a best-effort attempt to maintain the order in which messages are
sent.

When you send a message using `SendMessage`, Amazon SQS redundantly stores the
message in multiple availability zones (AZs) before acknowledging it. This redundancy
ensures that no single computer, network, or AZ failure can render the messages
inaccessible.

You can create and configure queues using the Amazon SQS console. For detailed instructions,
see [Creating a standard queue using the Amazon SQS console](creating-sqs-standard-queues.md#step-create-standard-queue). For Java-specific examples, see [Amazon SQS Java SDK examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-java-tutorials.html).

**Use cases for standard queues**

Standard message queues are suitable for various scenarios, as long as your application
can handle messages that might arrive more than once or out of order. Examples
include:

- **Decoupling live user requests from intensive background**
**work** – Users can upload media while the system resizes or
encodes it in the background.

- **Allocating tasks to multiple worker nodes**
– For example, handling a high volume of credit card validation
requests.

- **Batching messages for future processing** –
Scheduling multiple entries to be added to a database at a later time.
