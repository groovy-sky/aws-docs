# Enabling client-side buffering and request batching with Amazon SQS

The [AWS SDK for Java](https://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava) includes
`AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient` which accesses Amazon SQS. This client allows
for simple request batching using client-side buffering. Calls made from the client are
first buffered and then sent as a batch request to Amazon SQS.

Client-side buffering allows up to 10 requests to be buffered and sent as a batch
request, decreasing your cost of using Amazon SQS and reducing the number of sent requests.
`AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient` buffers both synchronous and asynchronous
calls. Batched requests and support for [long\
polling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-short-and-long-polling.html) can also help increase throughput. For more information, see [Increasing throughput using horizontal scaling and action batching with Amazon SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-throughput-horizontal-scaling-and-batching.html).

Because `AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient` implements the same interface as
`AmazonSQSAsyncClient`, migrating from `AmazonSQSAsyncClient`
to `AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient` typically requires only minimal changes to
your existing code.

###### Note

The Amazon SQS Buffered Asynchronous Client doesn't currently support FIFO queues.

## Using AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient

Before you begin, complete the steps in [Setting up Amazon SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-setting-up.html).

### AWS SDK for Java 1.x

For AWS SDK for Java 1.x, you can create a new
`AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient` based on the following
example:

```java

// Create the basic Amazon SQS async client
final AmazonSQSAsync sqsAsync = new AmazonSQSAsyncClient();

// Create the buffered client
final AmazonSQSAsync bufferedSqs = new AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient(sqsAsync);
```

After you create the new `AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient`, you can
use it to send multiple requests to Amazon SQS (just as you can with
`AmazonSQSAsyncClient`), for example:

```java

final CreateQueueRequest createRequest = new CreateQueueRequest().withQueueName("MyQueue");

final CreateQueueResult res = bufferedSqs.createQueue(createRequest);

final SendMessageRequest request = new SendMessageRequest();
final String body = "Your message text" + System.currentTimeMillis();
request.setMessageBody( body );
request.setQueueUrl(res.getQueueUrl());

final Future<SendMessageResult> sendResult = bufferedSqs.sendMessageAsync(request);

final ReceiveMessageRequest receiveRq = new ReceiveMessageRequest()
    .withMaxNumberOfMessages(1)
    .withQueueUrl(queueUrl);
final ReceiveMessageResult rx = bufferedSqs.receiveMessage(receiveRq);
```

### Configuring AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient

`AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient` is preconfigured with settings that
work for most use cases. You can further configure
`AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient`, for example:

1. Create an instance of the `QueueBufferConfig` class with
    the required configuration parameters.

2. Provide the instance to the `AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient`
    constructor.

```java

// Create the basic Amazon SQS async client
final AmazonSQSAsync sqsAsync = new AmazonSQSAsyncClient();

final QueueBufferConfig config = new QueueBufferConfig()
    .withMaxInflightReceiveBatches(5)
    .withMaxDoneReceiveBatches(15);

// Create the buffered client
final AmazonSQSAsync bufferedSqs = new AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient(sqsAsync, config);
```

QueueBufferConfig configuration parametersParameterDefault valueDescription`longPoll``true`

When `longPoll` is set to `true`,
`AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient` attempts to
use long polling when it consumes messages.

`longPollWaitTimeoutSeconds`20 s

The maximum amount of time (in seconds) which a
`ReceiveMessage` call blocks off on the
server, waiting for messages to appear in the queue before
returning with an empty receive result.

###### Note

When long polling is disabled, this setting has no
effect.

`maxBatchOpenMs`200 ms

The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) that an
outgoing call waits for other calls with which it batches
messages of the same type.

The higher the setting, the fewer batches are required to
perform the same amount of work (however, the first call in
a batch has to spend a longer time waiting).

When you set this parameter to `0`, submitted
requests don't wait for other requests, effectively
disabling batching.

`maxBatchSize`10 requests per batch

The maximum number of messages that are batched together
in a single request. The higher the setting, the fewer
batches are required to carry out the same number of
requests.

###### Note

10 requests per batch is the maximum allowed value for
Amazon SQS.

`maxBatchSizeBytes`1 MiB

The maximum size of a message batch, in bytes, that the
client attempts to send to Amazon SQS.

###### Note

1 MiB is the maximum allowed value for Amazon SQS.

`maxDoneReceiveBatches`10 batches

The maximum number of receive batches that
`AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient` prefetches and
stores client-side.

The higher the setting, the more receive requests can be
satisfied without having to make a call to Amazon SQS (however,
the more messages are prefetched, the longer they remain in
the buffer, causing their own visibility timeout to
expire).

###### Note

`0` indicates that all message pre-fetching
is disabled and messages are consumed only on
demand.

`maxInflightOutboundBatches`5 batches

The maximum number of active outbound batches that can be
processed at the same time.

The higher the setting, the faster outbound batches can be
sent (subject to quotas such as CPU or bandwidth) and the
more threads are consumed by
`AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient`.

`maxInflightReceiveBatches`10 batches

The maximum number of active receive batches that can be
processed at the same time.

The higher the setting, the more messages can be received
(subject to quotas such as CPU or bandwidth), and the more
threads are consumed by
`AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient`.

###### Note

`0` indicates that all message pre-fetching
is disabled and messages are consumed only on
demand.

`visibilityTimeoutSeconds`-1

When this parameter is set to a positive, non-zero value,
the visibility timeout set here overrides the visibility
timeout set on the queue from which messages are
consumed.

###### Note

`-1` indicates that the default setting is
selected for the queue.

You can't set visibility timeout to
`0`.

### AWS SDK for Java 2.x

For AWS SDK for Java 2.x, you can create a new
`SqsAsyncBatchManager` based on the following example:

```java

// Create the basic Sqs Async Client
SqsAsyncClient sqs = SqsAsyncClient.builder()
    .region(Region.US_EAST_1)
    .build();

// Create the batch manager
SqsAsyncBatchManager sqsAsyncBatchManager = sqs.batchManager();
```

After you create the new `SqsAsyncBatchManager`, you can use it to
send multiple requests to Amazon SQS (just as you can with
`SqsAsyncClient`), for example:

```java

final String queueName = "MyAsyncBufferedQueue" + UUID.randomUUID();
final CreateQueueRequest request = CreateQueueRequest.builder().queueName(queueName).build();
final String queueUrl = sqs.createQueue(request).join().queueUrl();
System.out.println("Queue created: " + queueUrl);

// Send messages
CompletableFuture<SendMessageResponse> sendMessageFuture;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    final int index = i;
    sendMessageFuture = sqsAsyncBatchManager.sendMessage(
            r -> r.messageBody("Message " + index).queueUrl(queueUrl));
    SendMessageResponse response= sendMessageFuture.join();
    System.out.println("Message " + response.messageId() + " sent!");
}

// Receive messages with customized configurations
CompletableFuture<ReceiveMessageResponse> receiveResponseFuture = customizedBatchManager.receiveMessage(
        r -> r.queueUrl(queueUrl)
                .waitTimeSeconds(10)
                .visibilityTimeout(20)
                .maxNumberOfMessages(10)
);
System.out.println("You have received " + receiveResponseFuture.join().messages().size() + " messages in total.");

// Delete messages
DeleteQueueRequest deleteQueueRequest =  DeleteQueueRequest.builder().queueUrl(queueUrl).build();
int code = sqs.deleteQueue(deleteQueueRequest).join().sdkHttpResponse().statusCode();
System.out.println("Queue is deleted, with statusCode " + code);
```

### Configuring SqsAsyncBatchManager

`SqsAsyncBatchManager` is preconfigured with settings that work for
most use cases. You can further configure `SqsAsyncBatchManager`, for
example:

Creating custom configuration via
`SqsAsyncBatchManager.Builder`:

```java

SqsAsyncBatchManager customizedBatchManager = SqsAsyncBatchManager.builder()
    .client(sqs)
    .scheduledExecutor(Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(5))
    .overrideConfiguration(b -> b
        .maxBatchSize(10)
        .sendRequestFrequency(Duration.ofMillis(200))
        .receiveMessageMinWaitDuration(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
        .receiveMessageVisibilityTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(20))
        .receiveMessageAttributeNames(Collections.singletonList("*"))
        .receiveMessageSystemAttributeNames(Collections.singletonList(MessageSystemAttributeName.ALL)))
    .build();
```

`BatchOverrideConfiguration` parametersParameterDefault valueDescription`maxBatchSize`

10 requests per batch

The maximum number of messages that are batched
together in a single request. The higher the setting, the
fewer batches are required to carry out the same number of
requests.

###### Note

The maximum allowed value for Amazon SQS is 10 requests per
batch.

`sendRequestFrequency`

200 ms

The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) that an
outgoing call waits for other calls with which it batches
messages of the same type.

The higher the setting, the fewer batches are required to
perform the same amount of work (however, the first call in
a batch has to spend a longer time waiting).

When you set this parameter to `0`, submitted
requests don't wait for other requests, effectively
disabling batching.

`receiveMessageVisibilityTimeout`

-1

When this parameter is set to a positive, non-zero
value, the visibility timeout set here overrides the
visibility timeout set on the queue from which messages are
consumed.

###### Note

`1` indicates that the default setting is
selected for the queue. You can't set visibility timeout
to `0`.

`receiveMessageMinWaitDuration`

50 ms

The minimal amount of time (in milliseconds) that a
`receiveMessage` call waits for available
messages to be fetched. The higher the setting, the fewer
batches are required to carry out the same number of
request.
