# What is Amazon Simple Queue Service?

Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you
integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components. Amazon SQS offers common
constructs such as [dead-letter queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html) and
[cost allocation tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-tags.html). It provides a generic web
services API that you can access using any programming language that the AWS SDK
supports.

## Benefits of using Amazon SQS

- Security – [You control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/security-iam.html) who can
send messages to and receive messages from an Amazon SQS queue. You can choose to
transmit sensitive data by protecting the contents of messages in queues by
using default Amazon SQS managed server-side encryption (SSE), or by using custom
[SSE](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-server-side-encryption.html) keys managed in
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

- Durability – For the safety of your
messages, Amazon SQS stores them on multiple servers. Standard queues support [at-least-once message\
delivery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/standard-queues-at-least-once-delivery.html), and FIFO queues support [exactly-once message\
processing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing.html) and [high-throughput](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/high-throughput-fifo.html) mode.

- Availability – Amazon SQS uses [redundant infrastructure](#sqs-basic-architecture) to provide
highly-concurrent access to messages and high availability for producing and
consuming messages.

- Scalability – Amazon SQS can process each
[buffered\
request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-client-side-buffering-request-batching.html) independently, scaling transparently to handle any load
increases or spikes without any provisioning instructions.

- Reliability – Amazon SQS locks your messages
during processing, so that multiple producers can send and multiple consumers
can receive messages at the same time.

- Customization – Your queues don't
have to be exactly alike—for example, you can [set a default delay on a queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-delay-queues.html). You can
store the contents of messages larger than 1 MiB [using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-s3-messages.html) or Amazon DynamoDB, with
Amazon SQS holding a pointer to the Amazon S3 object, or you can split a large message
into smaller messages.

## Basic Amazon SQS architecture

This section describes the components of a distributed messaging system and explains the
lifecycle of an Amazon SQS message.

### Distributed queues

There are three main parts in a distributed messaging system: the **components of**
**your distributed system**, your **queue** (distributed on Amazon SQS servers), and the **messages**
**in the queue**.

In the following scenario, your system has several _producers_ (components that send messages
to the queue) and _consumers_ (components that receive messages from the queue). The queue (which
holds messages A through E) redundantly stores the messages across multiple Amazon SQS servers.

### Message lifecycle

The following scenario describes the lifecycle of an Amazon SQS message in a queue, from
creation to deletion.

![The lifecycle of an Amazon SQS message in a queue, from creation to deletion.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/sqs-message-lifecycle-diagram.png)

![Section one description for the previous lifecycle diagram.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/number-1-red.png) A producer (Component 1) sends message A to a queue, and the
message is distributed across the Amazon SQS servers redundantly.

![Section two description for the previous lifecycle diagram.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/number-2-red.png) When a consumer (Component 2) is ready to process messages, it
consumes messages from the queue, and message A is returned. While message A is being
processed, it remains in the queue and isn't returned to subsequent receive requests for
the duration of the [visibility\
timeout](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html).

![Section three description for the previous lifecycle diagram.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/number-3-red.png) The consumer (Component 2) deletes message A from the queue to
prevent the message from being received and processed again when the visibility timeout
expires.

###### Note

Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages that have been in a queue for more than the
maximum message retention period. The default message retention period is 4 days.
However, you can set the message retention period to a value from 60 seconds to
1,209,600 seconds (14 days) using the `SetQueueAttributes` action.

## Differences between Amazon SQS, Amazon MQ, and Amazon SNS

Amazon SQS, [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns), and [Amazon MQ](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq) offer highly scalable and easy-to-use
managed messaging services, each designed for specific roles within distributed systems.
Here's an enhanced overview of the differences between these services:

**Amazon SQS** decouples and scales distributed software systems
and components as a queue service. It processes messages through a single subscriber
typically, ideal for workflows where order and loss prevention are critical. For wider
distribution, integrating Amazon SQS with Amazon SNS enables a [fanout messaging pattern](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/send-fanout-event-notifications), effectively pushing messages to multiple
subscribers at once.

**Amazon SNS** allows publishers to send messages to multiple
subscribers through topics, which serve as communication channels. Subscribers receive
published messages using a supported endpoint type, such as [Amazon Data Firehose](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.html), [Amazon SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/welcome.html),
[Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html), HTTP,
email, mobile push notifications, and mobile text messages (SMS). This service is ideal
for scenarios requiring immediate notifications, such as real-time user engagement or
alarm systems. To prevent message loss when subscribers are offline, integrating Amazon SNS
with Amazon SQS queue messages ensures consistent delivery.

**Amazon MQ** fits best with enterprises looking to migrate
from traditional message brokers, supporting standard messaging protocols like AMQP and
MQTT, along with [Apache ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/) and
[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/). It offers compatibility
with legacy systems needing stable, reliable messaging without significant
reconfiguration.

The following chart provides an overview of each services' resource type:

Both Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS are recommended for new applications that can benefit from nearly
unlimited scalability and simple APIs. They generally offer more cost-effective
solutions for high-volume applications with their pay-as-you-go pricing. We recommend
Amazon MQ for migrating applications from existing message brokers that rely on
compatibility with APIs such as JMS or protocols such as Advanced Message Queuing
Protocol (AMQP), MQTT, OpenWire, and Simple Text Oriented Message Protocol
(STOMP).
