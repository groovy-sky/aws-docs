# Amazon SQS standard queue quotas

The following table lists quotas related to standard queues.

QuotaDescriptionDelay queueThe default (minimum) delay for a queue is 0 seconds. The maximum is 15 minutes.Listed queues1,000 queues per [`ListQueues`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_ListQueues.html) request.Long polling wait timeThe maximum long polling wait time is 20 seconds.Messages per queue (backlog)The number of messages that an Amazon SQS queue can store is unlimited.Messages per queue (in flight)

For most standard queues (depending on queue traffic and message backlog), there can be a maximum of approximately 120,000 in flight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue).
If you reach this quota while using [short polling](sqs-short-and-long-polling.md#sqs-short-polling), Amazon SQS returns the `OverLimit` error message. If you use [long polling](sqs-short-and-long-polling.md#sqs-long-polling), Amazon SQS returns no error messages.
To avoid reaching the quota, you should delete messages from the queue after they're processed. You can also increase the number of queues you use to process your messages.
To request a quota increase, [submit a support request](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/sqs/quotas).

Queue name

A queue name can have up to 80 characters. The following characters are accepted: alphanumeric characters, hyphens ( `-`), and underscores ( `_`).

###### Note

Queue names are case-sensitive (for example,
`Test-queue` and `test-queue` are
different queues).

Queue tag

We don't recommend adding more than 50 tags to a queue. Tagging supports Unicode characters in UTF-8.

The tag `Key` is required, but the tag `Value`
is optional.The tag `Key` and tag `Value` are
case-sensitive.The tag `Key` and tag `Value` can include
Unicode alphanumeric characters in UTF-8 and whitespaces. The following
special characters are allowed: `_ . : / = + - @`The tag `Key` or `Value` must not include the
reserved prefix `aws:` (you can't delete tag keys or values
with this prefix).The maximum tag `Key` length is 128 Unicode characters in
UTF-8. The tag `Key` must not be empty or null.The maximum tag `Value` length is 256 Unicode characters
in UTF-8. The tag `Value` may be empty or null.Tagging actions are limited to 30 TPS per AWS account. If your application requires a higher throughput, [submit a request](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/sqs/quotas).
