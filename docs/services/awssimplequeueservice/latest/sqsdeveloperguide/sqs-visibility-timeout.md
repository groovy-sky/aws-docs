# Amazon SQS visibility timeout

When you receive a message from an Amazon SQS queue, it remains in the queue but becomes
temporarily invisible to other consumers. This invisibility is controlled by the visibility
timeout, which ensures that other consumers cannot process the same message while you are
working on it. Amazon SQS offers two options for deleting messages after processing:

- **Manual deletion** – You explicitly delete
messages using the [`DeleteMessage`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteMessage.html) action.

- **Automatic deletion** – Supported in certain
AWS SDKs, messages are automatically deleted upon successful processing,
simplifying workflows.

## Visibility timeout use cases

**Manage long-running tasks** – Use the visibility
timeout to handle tasks that require extended processing times. Set an appropriate
visibility timeout for messages that require extended processing time. This ensures that
other consumers don't pick up the same message while it's being processed, preventing
duplicate work and maintaining system efficiency.

**Implement retry mechanisms** – Extend the
visibility timeout programmatically for tasks that fail to complete within the initial
timeout. If a task fails to complete within the initial visibility timeout, you can
extend the timeout programmatically. This allows your system to retry processing the
message without it becoming visible to other consumers, improving fault tolerance and
reliability. Combine with **Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs)** to
manage persistent failures.

**Coordinate distributed systems** – Use SQS
visibility timeout to coordinate tasks across distributed systems. Set visibility
timeouts that align with your expected processing times for different components. This
helps maintain consistency and prevents race conditions in complex, distributed
architectures.

**Optimize resource utilization** – Adjust SQS
visibility timeouts to optimize resource utilization in your application. By setting
appropriate timeouts, you can ensure that messages are processed efficiently without
tying up resources unnecessarily. This leads to better overall system performance and
cost-effectiveness.

## Setting and adjusting the visibility timeout

The visibility timeout starts as soon as a message is delivered to you. During this
period, you're expected to process and delete the message. If you don't delete it before
the timeout expires, the message becomes visible again in the queue and can be retrieved
by another consumer. The default visibility timeout for a queue is 30 seconds, but you
can adjust this to match the time your application needs to process and delete a
message. You can also set a specific visibility timeout for individual messages without
changing the queue's overall setting. Use the [`ChangeMessageVisibility`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_ChangeMessageVisibility.html) action to programmatically extend
or shorten the timeout as needed.

## In flight messages and quotas

In Amazon SQS, in-flight messages are messages that have been received by a consumer but
not yet deleted. For standard queues, there's a limit of approximately 120,000 in-flight
messages, depending on queue traffic and message backlog. If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS
returns an `OverLimit` error, indicating that no additional messages can be
received until some in-flight messages are deleted. For FIFO queues, limits depend on
active message groups.

- **When using short polling** – If this
limit is reached while using short polling, Amazon SQS will return an
`OverLimit` error, indicating that no additional messages can be
received until some in-flight messages are deleted.

- **When using long polling** – If you are
using long polling, Amazon SQS does not return an error when the in-flight message
limit is reached. Instead, it will not return any new messages until the number
of in-flight messages drops below the limit.

To manage in-flight messages effectively:

1. **Prompt deletion** – Delete messages
    (manually or automatically) after processing to reduce the in-flight
    count.

2. **Monitor with CloudWatch** – Set alarms for
    high in-flight counts to prevent reaching the limit.

3. **Distribute load** – If you're processing
    a high volume of messages, use additional queues or consumers to balance load
    and avoid bottlenecks.

4. **Request a quota increase** – Submit a
    request to [AWS\
    Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/create-service-quota-increase.html) if higher limits are required.

## Understanding visibility timeout in standard and FIFO queues

In both standard and FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues, the visibility timeout helps
prevent multiple consumers from processing the same message simultaneously. However, due
to the at-least-once delivery model of Amazon SQS, there's no absolute guarantee that a
message won't be delivered more than once during the visibility timeout period.

- **Standard queues** – The visibility
timeout in standard queues prevents multiple consumers from processing the same
message at the same time. However, because of the at-least-once delivery model,
Amazon SQS doesn't guarantee that a message won’t be delivered more than once within
the visibility timeout period.

- **FIFO queues** – For FIFO queues,
messages with the same message group ID are processed in a strict sequence. When
a message with a message group ID is in-flight, subsequent messages in that
group are not made available until the in-flight message is either deleted or
the visibility timeout expires. However, this doesn’t "lock" the group
indefinitely– each message is processed in sequence, and only when each
message is deleted or becomes visible again will the next message in that group
be available to consumers. This approach ensures ordered processing within the
group without unnecessarily locking the group from delivering messages.

## Handling failures

If you don't process and delete a message before the visibility timeout expires—due to
application errors, crashes, or connectivity problems—the message becomes visible again
in the queue. It can then be retrieved by the same or a different consumer for another
processing attempt. This ensures that messages aren't lost even if the initial
processing fails. However, setting the visibility timeout too high can delay the
reappearance of unprocessed messages, potentially slowing down retries. It's crucial to
set an appropriate visibility timeout based on the expected processing time for timely
message handling.

## Changing and terminating visibility timeout

You can change or terminate the visibility timeout using the
`ChangeMessageVisibility` action:

- **Changing the timeout** – Adjust the
visibility timeout dynamically using [`ChangeMessageVisibility`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_ChangeMessageVisibility.html). This allows you to extend
or reduce timeout durations to match processing needs.

- **Terminating the timeout** – If you
decide not to process a received message, terminate its visibility timeout by
setting the `VisibilityTimeout` to 0 seconds through the
`ChangeMessageVisibility` action. This immediately makes the
message available for other consumers to process.

## Best practices

Use the following best practices for managing visibility timeouts in Amazon SQS, including
setting, adjusting, and extending timeouts, as well as handling unprocessed messages
using Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs).

- **Setting and adjusting the timeout.** Start by
setting the visibility timeout to match the maximum time your application
typically needs to process and delete a message. If you're unsure about the
exact processing time, begin with a shorter timeout (for example, 2 minutes) and
extend it as necessary. Implement a heartbeat mechanism to periodically extend
the visibility timeout, ensuring the message remains invisible until processing
is complete. This minimizes delays in reprocessing unhandled messages and
prevents premature visibility.

- **Extending the timeout and handling the 12-Hour**
**limit.** If your processing time varies or may exceed the initially
set timeout, use the `ChangeMessageVisibility` action to extend the
visibility timeout while processing the message. Keep in mind that the
visibility timeout has a maximum limit of 12 hours from when the message is
first received. Extending the timeout doesn't reset this 12-hour limit. If your
processing requires more time than this limit, consider using AWS Step Functions or
breaking the task into smaller steps.

- **Handling unprocessed messages.** To manage
messages that fail multiple processing attempts, configure a Dead-Letter Queue
(DLQ). This ensures that messages that can't be processed after several retries
are captured separately for further analysis or handling, preventing them from
repeatedly circulating in the main queue.
