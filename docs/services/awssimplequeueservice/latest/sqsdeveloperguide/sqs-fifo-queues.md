# Amazon SQS FIFO queues

FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues have all the capabilities of the [standard queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/standard-queues.html), but are designed to enhance messaging
between applications when the order of operations and events is critical, or where
duplicates can't be tolerated.

The most important features of FIFO queues are [FIFO (First-In-First-Out)\
delivery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-understanding-logic.html) and _[exactly-once\_
_processing](fifo-queues-exactly-once-processing.md)_:

- The order in which messages are sent and received is strictly preserved and a
message is delivered once and remains unavailable until a consumer processes and
deletes it.

- Duplicates aren't introduced into the queue.

Additionally, FIFO queues support _message groups_ that
allow multiple ordered message groups within a single queue.
There is no quota to the number of message groups within a FIFO queue.

Examples of situations where you might use FIFO queues include the following:

1. E-commerce order management system where order is critical

2. Integrating with a third-party systems where events need to be processed in
    order

3. Processing user-entered inputs in the order entered

4. Communications and networking – Sending and receiving data and information
    in the same order

5. Computer systems – Making sure that user-entered commands are run in the
    right order

6. Educational institutes – Preventing a student from enrolling in a course
    before registering for an account

7. Online ticketing system – Where tickets are distributed on a first come
    first serve basis

###### Note

FIFO queues also provide exactly-once processing, but have a limited number of
transactions per second (TPS). You can use Amazon SQS **high**
**throughput** mode with your FIFO queue to increase your transaction limit.
For details on using high throughput mode, see [High throughput for FIFO queues in Amazon SQS](high-throughput-fifo.md). For information on throughput quotas, see
[Amazon SQS message quotas](quotas-messages.md).

Amazon SQS FIFO queues are available in all Regions where Amazon SQS is available.
