# Amazon SQS queue types

Amazon SQS supports two types of queues: [standard queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/standard-queues.html) and [FIFO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-fifo-queues.html) queues. Use the following table to determine
which queue best fits your needs.

Standard queuesFIFO queues

**Unlimited throughput** –
Standard queues support a very high, nearly unlimited number of API calls per second, per action
( [`SendMessage`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessage.html), [`ReceiveMessage`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_ReceiveMessage.html), or [`DeleteMessage`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteMessage.html)). This high throughput makes them ideal for use cases that require processing large volumes of messages quickly, such as real-time data streaming or large-scale applications. While standard queues scale automatically with demand, it is essential to monitor usage patterns to ensure optimal performance, especially in regions with higher workloads.

**At-least-once delivery** –
Guaranteed at-least-once delivery, meaning that every message is
delivered at least once, but in some cases, a message may be delivered
more than once due to retries or network delays. You should design your
application to handle potential duplicate messages by using idempotent
operations, which ensure that processing the same message multiple times
will not affect the system’s state.

**Best-effort ordering** –
Provides best-effort ordering, meaning that while Amazon SQS attempts to
deliver messages in the order they were sent, it does not guarantee
this. In some cases, messages may arrive out of order, especially under
conditions of high throughput or failure recovery. For applications
where the order of message processing is crucial, you should handle
reordering logic within the application or use FIFO queues for strict
ordering guarantees.

**Durability and redundancy** –
Standard queues ensure high durability by storing multiple copies of
each message across multiple AWS Availability Zones. This ensures that
messages are not lost, even in the event of infrastructure
failures.

**Visibility timeout** – Amazon SQS
allows you to configure a visibility timeout to control how long a
message stays hidden after being received, ensuring that other consumers
do not process the message until it has been fully handled or the
timeout expires.

**High throughput** –
When you use [batching](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-batch-api-actions.html), FIFO queues process up to
3,000 messages per second per API method ( [`SendMessageBatch`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessageBatch.html), [`ReceiveMessage`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_ReceiveMessage.html), or [`DeleteMessageBatch`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteMessageBatch.html)).
This throughput relies on 300 API calls per second, with each API call handling a batch of 10 messages.By enabling high throughput mode, you can scale up to 30,000 transactions per second (TPS) with relaxed ordering within message groups. Without batching, FIFO queues support up to 300 API calls per second per API method ( `SendMessage`, `ReceiveMessage`, or `DeleteMessage`). If you need more throughput, you can request a quota increase through the
[AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home). To
enable high-throughput mode, see [Enabling high throughput for FIFO queues in Amazon SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/enable-high-throughput-fifo.html).

**Exactly-once processing** – FIFO
queues deliver each message once and keep it available until you process
and delete it. By using features like [`MessageDeduplicationId`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessage.html) or content-based
deduplication, you prevent duplicate messages, even when retrying due to
network issues or timeouts.

**First-in-first-out delivery** –
FIFO queues ensure that you receive messages in the order they are sent
within each message group. By distributing messages across multiple
groups, you can process them in parallel while still maintaining the
order within each group.

Use standard queues to send data between applications when throughput is
crucial, for example:

- **Decouple live user requests from**
**intensive background work.** Allow users to upload
media quickly while you process tasks like resizing or encoding
in the background, ensuring fast response times without
overloading the system.

- **Allocate tasks to multiple worker**
**nodes.** Distribute a high number of credit card
validation requests across multiple worker nodes, and handle
duplicate messages with idempotent operations to avoid
processing errors.

- **Batch messages for future**
**processing.** Queue multiple entries for batch
additions to a database. Since message order isn’t guaranteed,
design your system to handle out-of-order processing if
necessary.

Use FIFO queues to send data between applications when the order of
events is important, for example:

- **Make sure that user-entered commands are**
**run in the right order.** This is a key use case
for FIFO queues, where command order is crucial. For example, if
a user performs a sequence of actions in an application, FIFO
queues ensure the actions are processed in the same order they
were entered.

- **Display the correct product price by**
**sending price modifications in the right order.**
FIFO queues ensure that multiple updates to a product's price
arrive and are processed sequentially. Without FIFO, a price
reduction might be processed after a price increase, causing
incorrect data to be displayed.

- **Prevent a student from enrolling in a**
**course before registering for an account.** By
using FIFO queues, you ensure that the registration process
occurs in the correct sequence. The system processes the account
registration first and then the course enrollment, preventing
the enrollment request from being executed prematurely.
