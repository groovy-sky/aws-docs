# Configuring an Amazon SQS queue to trigger an AWS Lambda function

You can use a Lambda function to process messages from an Amazon SQS queue. Lambda polls the
queue and invokes your function synchronously, passing a batch of messages as an
event.

**Configuring visibility timeout**

Set the queue's visibility timeout to at least six times the [function timeout](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-function-common.html#configuration-common-summary). This ensures Lambda has enough time to retry if a
function is throttled while processing a previous batch.

**Using a dead-letter queue (DLQ)**

Specify a dead-letter queue to capture messages that the Lambda function fails
to process.

**Handling multiple queues and functions**

A Lambda function can process multiple queues by creating a separate event
source for each queue. You can also associate multiple Lambda functions with the
same queue.

**Permissions for encrypted queues**

If you associate an encrypted queue with a Lambda function but Lambda doesn't
poll for messages, add the `kms:Decrypt` permission to your Lambda
execution role.

**Restrictions**

The queue and Lambda function must be in the same AWS Region.

An [encrypted queue](sqs-server-side-encryption.md)
that uses the default key (AWS managed KMS key for Amazon SQS) cannot invoke a Lambda function in a different AWS account.

For implementation details, see [Using AWS Lambda\
with Amazon SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html) in the _AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

## Prerequisites

To configure Lambda function triggers, you must meet the following requirements:

- If you use a user, your Amazon SQS role must include the following
permissions:

- `lambda:CreateEventSourceMapping`

- `lambda:ListEventSourceMappings`

- `lambda:ListFunctions`

- The Lambda execution role must include the following permissions:

- `sqs:DeleteMessage`

- `sqs:GetQueueAttributes`

- `sqs:ReceiveMessage`

- If you associate an encrypted queue with a Lambda function, add the
`kms:Decrypt` permission to the Lambda execution role.

For more information, see [Overview of managing access in Amazon SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-overview-of-managing-access.html).

###### To configure a queue to trigger a Lambda function (console)

1. Open the Amazon SQS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Queues**.

3. On the **Queues** page, choose the queue to configure.

4. On the queue's page, choose the **Lambda triggers** tab.

5. On the **Lambda triggers** page, choose a Lambda trigger.

If the list doesn't include the Lambda trigger that you need, choose
    **Configure Lambda function trigger**. Enter the Amazon Resource
    Name (ARN) of the Lambda function or choose an existing resource. Then choose
    **Save**.

6. Choose **Save**. The console saves the configuration and displays
    the **Details** page for the queue.

On the **Details** page, the **Lambda triggers**
    tab displays the Lambda function and its status. It takes approximately 1 minute for
    the Lambda function to become associated with your queue.

7. To verify the results of the configuration, [send\
    a message to your queue](creating-sqs-standard-queues.md#sqs-send-messages) and then view the triggered Lambda function in the
    Lambda console.
