# Logging network activity events

CloudTrail network activity events enable VPC endpoint owners to record AWS API calls made
using their VPC endpoints from a private VPC to the AWS service. Network activity events
provide visibility into the resource operations performed within a VPC. For example, logging
network activity events can help VPC endpoint owners detect when credentials from outside
their organization attempt to access their VPC endpoints.

You can log network activity events for the following services:

- AWS AppConfig

## Advanced event selector fields for network activity events

You configure advanced event selectors to log network activity events by
specifying the event source for which you want to log activity. You can
configure advanced event selectors using the AWS SDKs, AWS CLI, or CloudTrail console.

The following advanced event selector fields are required to log network activity events:

- `eventCategory` – To log network activity events, the value
must be `NetworkActivity`. `eventCategory` can only use
the `Equals` operator.

- `eventSource` – The event source for which you want to log
network activity events. `eventSource` can only use the `Equals`
operator. If you want to log network activity events for multiple event sources, you must create a separate field selector for each event source.

Valid values include:

- `aco-automation.amazonaws.com`

- `appconfig.amazonaws.com`

- `application-signals.amazonaws.com`

- `appmesh.amazonaws.com`

- `athena.amazonaws.com`

The following advanced event selector fields are optional:

- `eventName` – The requested action that you want to filter
on. For example, `CreateKey` or `ListKeys`. `eventName` can use any
operator.

- `errorCode` – The requested error code that you want to
filter on. Currently, the only valid `errorCode` is
`VpceAccessDenied`. You can use only the `Equals` operator with
`errorCode`.

- `vpcEndpointId` – Identifies the VPC endpoint that the operation passed through. You can
use any operator with `vpcEndpointId`.

Network activity events are not logged by default when you create a trail or event
data store. To record CloudTrail network activity events, you must explicitly configure each event
source for which you want to collect activity.

Additional charges apply for logging network activity events. For CloudTrail pricing, see
[AWS CloudTrail Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing).

## Logging network activity events with the AWS Management Console

You can update an existing trail or event data store to log network
activity events using the console.

###### Topics

- [Update an existing event data store to log network activity events](#log-network-events-lake-console)

### Update an existing trail to log network activity events

Use the following procedure to update an existing trail to log network activity
events.

###### Note

Additional charges apply for logging network activity events. For CloudTrail
pricing, see [AWS CloudTrail\
Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing).

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail).

2. In the left navigation pane of the CloudTrail console, open the
    **Trails** page, and choose a trail name.

3. If your trail is logging data events using basic event selectors,
    you’ll need to switch to advanced event selectors to log network activity events.

Take these steps to switch to advanced event selectors:
1. In the **Data events** area, take note of the current data event selectors.
       Switching to advanced event selectors will clear out any existing data event selectors.

2. Choose **Edit** and
       then choose **Switch to advanced event selectors**.

3. Reapply your data event selections using advanced event selectors.
       For more information, see [Updating an existing trail to log data events with advanced event selectors using the console](logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.md#logging-data-events-with-the-cloudtrail-console-adv).
4. In **Network activity events**, choose
    **Edit**.

To log network activity events, take the following steps:
1. From **Network activity event source**, choose the source for network activity events.

       You can choose to log all network activity events, log all network activity access denied events, or choose **Custom** to
       build a custom log selector to filter on multiple fields, such as `eventName` and `vpcEndpointId`.

3. (Optional) Enter a name to identify the selector. The selector name is listed as **Name** in the advanced event selector and is viewable if you expand the
       **JSON view**.

4. In **Advanced event**
      **selectors** build expressions by choosing values for **Field**,
       **Operator**, and **Value**. You can skip this step if you are using a predefined log template.
      1. For excluding or including network activity
          events, you can choose from the following fields in the console.

- **`eventName`** – You can use any operator with `eventName`.
You can use it to include or exclude any event, such as `CreateKey`.

- **`errorCode`** – You can use it to filter on an error code. Currently, the only supported `errorCode` is `VpceAccessDenied`.

- **`vpcEndpointId`** – Identifies the VPC endpoint that the operation passed through. You can use
any operator with `vpcEndpointId`.

      2. For each field, choose **\+ Condition** to add as many conditions as you need, up to a maximum of 500 specified values for all conditions.

      3. Choose **\+ Field** to add additional fields as required. To avoid errors, do not set conflicting or duplicate values for fields.
5. To add another event source for which you want to log network activity events, choose **Add**
      **network activity event selector**.

6. Optionally, expand **JSON view** to see your
       advanced event selectors as a JSON block.
5. Choose **Save changes** to save your changes.

### Examples: Logging network activity events for event data stores

You can configure your event data stores to include network activity events using
the AWS CLI. Use the [`create-event-data-store`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudtrail/create-event-data-store.html) command to create a new event
data store to log network activity events. Use the [`update-event-data-store`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudtrail/update-event-data-store.html) command to update the advanced
event selectors for an existing event data store.

To see whether your event data store includes network activity events, run the
[`get-event-data-store`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudtrail/get-event-data-store.html) command.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail get-event-data-store --event-data-store EventDataStoreARN

#### Example: Log all network activity events for CloudTrail operations

The following example shows how to create an event data store that includes
all network activity events related to CloudTrail operations, such as calls to
`CreateTrail` and `CreateEventDataStore`. The value
for the `eventSource` field is set to
`cloudtrail.amazonaws.com`.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail create-event-data-store \
--name "EventDataStoreName" \
--advanced-event-selectors '[
    {
        "Name": "Audit all CloudTrail API calls over VPC endpoint",

`s3.amazonaws.com`.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail create-event-data-store \
--name EventDataStoreName \
--advanced-event-selectors '[
    {
        "Name": "Log S3 access denied network activity events",
        "FieldSelectors": [
            {
                "Field": "eventCategory",
                "Equals": ["NetworkActivity"]
            },
            {
                "Field": "eventSource",
                "Equals": ["s3.amazonaws.com"]
            },
            {

                "Equals": ["VpceAccessDenied"]
            }
        ]
    }

#### Example: Log all management events and network activity events for multiple event sources

The following examples updates an event data store that is currently logging only
management events to also log network activity events for multiple event
sources. To update an event data store to add new event selectors, run the
`get-event-data-store` command to return the current advanced
event selectors. Then, run the `update-event-data-store` command and
pass in the `--advanced-event-selectors` that includes the current
selectors plus any new selectors. To log network activity events for multiple
event sources, include one selector for each event source that you want to
log.

## Logging events with the AWS SDKs

Run the [GetEventSelectors](../../../../reference/awscloudtrail/latest/apireference/api-geteventselectors.md)
operation to see whether your trail is logging network activity events. You can
configure your trails to log network activity events by running the [PutEventSelectors](../../../../reference/awscloudtrail/latest/apireference/api-puteventselectors.md) operation.
For more information, see the [AWS CloudTrail API Reference](../../../../reference/awscloudtrail/latest/apireference.md).

Run the [GetEventDataStore](../../../../reference/awscloudtrail/latest/apireference/api-geteventdatastore.md)
operation to see whether your event data store is logging network activity events. You
can configure your event data stores to include network activity events by running the
[CreateEventDataStore](../../../../reference/awscloudtrail/latest/apireference/api-createeventdatastore.md) or [UpdateEventDataStore](../../../../reference/awscloudtrail/latest/apireference/api-updateeventdatastore.md)
operations and specifying advanced event selectors. For more information, see [Create, update, and manage event data stores with the AWS CLI](lake-eds-cli.md) and the [AWS CloudTrail API Reference](../../../../reference/awscloudtrail/latest/apireference.md).
