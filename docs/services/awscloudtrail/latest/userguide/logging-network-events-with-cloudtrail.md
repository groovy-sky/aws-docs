# Logging network activity events
<a name="logging-network-events-with-cloudtrail"></a>

CloudTrail network activity events enable VPC endpoint owners to record AWS API calls made using their VPC endpoints from a private VPC to the AWS service. Network activity events provide visibility into the resource operations performed within a VPC. For example, logging network activity events can help VPC endpoint owners detect when credentials from outside their organization attempt to access their VPC endpoints.

You can log network activity events for the following services:
+ AWS AppConfig
+ AWS App Mesh
+ Amazon Athena
+ AWS B2B Data Interchange
+ AWS Backup gateway
+ Amazon Bedrock
+ Billing and Cost Management
+ AWS Pricing Calculator
+ AWS Cost Explorer

## Advanced event selector fields for network activity events
<a name="logging-network-events"></a>

You configure advanced event selectors to log network activity events by specifying the event source for which you want to log activity. You can configure advanced event selectors using the AWS SDKs, AWS CLI, or CloudTrail console.

The following advanced event selector fields are required to log network activity events:
+ `eventCategory` – To log network activity events, the value must be `NetworkActivity`. `eventCategory` can only use the `Equals` operator.
+ `eventSource` – The event source for which you want to log network activity events. `eventSource` can only use the `Equals` operator. If you want to log network activity events for multiple event sources, you must create a separate field selector for each event source.

  Valid values include:
  + `aco-automation.amazonaws.com`
  + `appconfig.amazonaws.com`
  + `application-signals.amazonaws.com`
  + `appmesh.amazonaws.com`
  + `athena.amazonaws.com`

The following advanced event selector fields are optional:
+ `eventName` – The requested action that you want to filter on. For example, `CreateKey` or `ListKeys`. `eventName` can use any operator.
+ `errorCode` – The requested error code that you want to filter on. Currently, the only valid `errorCode` is `VpceAccessDenied`. You can use only the `Equals` operator with `errorCode`.
+ `vpcEndpointId` – Identifies the VPC endpoint that the operation passed through. You can use any operator with `vpcEndpointId`.
+ `userIdentity.arn` – Include or exclude events for actions taken by specific IAM identities. For more information, see [CloudTrail userIdentity element](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.html). You can use any operator with `userIdentity.arn`. CloudTrail supports this field for trails only. You cannot filter network activity events on `userIdentity.arn` for event data stores.

Network activity events are not logged by default when you create a trail or event data store. To record CloudTrail network activity events, you must explicitly configure each event source for which you want to collect activity.

Additional charges apply for logging network activity events. For CloudTrail pricing, see [AWS CloudTrail Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing/).

## Logging network activity events with the AWS Management Console
<a name="creating-network-event-selectors-with-the-console"></a>

You can update an existing trail or event data store to log network activity events using the console.

### Update an existing trail to log network activity events
<a name="log-network-events-trail-console"></a>

Use the following procedure to update an existing trail to log network activity events.

**Note**
Additional charges apply for logging network activity events. For CloudTrail pricing, see [AWS CloudTrail Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing/).

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/).

1. In the left navigation pane of the CloudTrail console, open the **Trails** page, and choose a trail name.

1. If your trail is logging data events using basic event selectors, you’ll need to switch to advanced event selectors to log network activity events.

   Take these steps to switch to advanced event selectors:

   1. In the **Data events** area, take note of the current data event selectors. Switching to advanced event selectors will clear out any existing data event selectors.

   1. Choose **Edit** and then choose **Switch to advanced event selectors**.

   1. Reapply your data event selections using advanced event selectors. For more information, see [Updating an existing trail to log data events with advanced event selectors using the console](logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.md#logging-data-events-with-the-cloudtrail-console-adv).

1. In **Network activity events**, choose **Edit**.

   To log network activity events, take the following steps:

   1. From **Network activity event source**, choose the source for network activity events.

   1. In **Log selector template**, choose a template. You can choose to log all network activity events, log all network activity access denied events, or choose **Custom** to build a custom log selector to filter on multiple fields, such as `eventName` and `vpcEndpointId`.

   1. (Optional) Enter a name to identify the selector. The selector name is listed as **Name** in the advanced event selector and is viewable if you expand the **JSON view**.

   1. In **Advanced event selectors** build expressions by choosing values for **Field**, **Operator**, and **Value**. You can skip this step if you are using a predefined log template.

      1. For excluding or including network activity events, you can choose from the following fields in the console.
         + **`eventName`** – You can use any operator with `eventName`. You can use it to include or exclude any event, such as `CreateKey`.
         + **`errorCode`** – You can use it to filter on an error code. Currently, the only supported `errorCode` is `VpceAccessDenied`.
         +  **`vpcEndpointId`** – Identifies the VPC endpoint that the operation passed through. You can use any operator with `vpcEndpointId`.

      1. For each field, choose **\+ Condition** to add as many conditions as you need, up to a maximum of 500 specified values for all conditions.

      1. Choose **\+ Field** to add additional fields as required. To avoid errors, do not set conflicting or duplicate values for fields.

   1. To add another event source for which you want to log network activity events, choose **Add network activity event selector**.

   1. Optionally, expand **JSON view** to see your advanced event selectors as a JSON block.

1. Choose **Save changes** to save your changes.

### Examples: Logging network activity events for event data stores
<a name="logging-network-events-CLI-eds-examples"></a>

You can configure your event data stores to include network activity events using the AWS CLI. Use the [`create-event-data-store`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudtrail/create-event-data-store.html) command to create a new event data store to log network activity events. Use the [`update-event-data-store`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudtrail/update-event-data-store.html) command to update the advanced event selectors for an existing event data store.

To see whether your event data store includes network activity events, run the [`get-event-data-store`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudtrail/get-event-data-store.html) command.

```
aws cloudtrail get-event-data-store --event-data-store {{EventDataStoreARN}}
```

#### Example: Log `VpceAccessDenied` events for Amazon S3
<a name="creating-network-events-eds-CLI-s3"></a>

The following example shows how to create an event data store to include `VpceAccessDenied` events for Amazon S3. This example sets the `errorCode` field equal to `VpceAccessDenied` events and the `eventSource` field equal to `s3.amazonaws.com`.

```
aws cloudtrail create-event-data-store \
--name {{EventDataStoreName}} \
--advanced-event-selectors '[
    {
        "Name": "Log S3 access denied network activity events",
        "FieldSelectors": [
            {
                "Field": "eventCategory",
                "Equals": ["NetworkActivity"]
            },
            {
                "Field": "eventSource",
                "Equals": ["s3.amazonaws.com"]
            },
            {
                "Field": "errorCode",
                "Equals": ["VpceAccessDenied"]
            }
        ]
    }
]'
```

The command returns the following example output.

```

#### Example: Log all management events and network activity events for multiple event sources
<a name="creating-network-events-eds-CLI-multiple"></a>

The following examples updates an event data store that is currently logging only management events to also log network activity events for multiple event sources. To update an event data store to add new event selectors, run the `get-event-data-store` command to return the current advanced event selectors. Then, run the `update-event-data-store` command and pass in the `--advanced-event-selectors` that includes the current selectors plus any new selectors. To log network activity events for multiple event sources, include one selector for each event source that you want to log.

```
aws cloudtrail update-event-data-store \
--event-data-store arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:123456789012:eventdatastore/EXAMPLE-f852-4e8f-8bd1-bcf6cEXAMPLE \

## Logging events with the AWS SDKs
<a name="logging-network-events-with-the-AWS-SDKs"></a>

Run the [GetEventSelectors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_GetEventSelectors.html) operation to see whether your trail is logging network activity events. You can configure your trails to log network activity events by running the [PutEventSelectors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_PutEventSelectors.html) operation. For more information, see the [AWS CloudTrail API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/).

Run the [GetEventDataStore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_GetEventDataStore.html) operation to see whether your event data store is logging network activity events. You can configure your event data stores to include network activity events by running the [CreateEventDataStore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEventDataStore.html) or [UpdateEventDataStore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateEventDataStore.html) operations and specifying advanced event selectors. For more information, see [Create, update, and manage event data stores with the AWS CLI](lake-eds-cli.md) and the [AWS CloudTrail API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/).
