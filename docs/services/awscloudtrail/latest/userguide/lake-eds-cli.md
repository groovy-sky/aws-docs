# Create, update, and manage event data stores with the AWS CLI

###### Note

AWS CloudTrail Lake will no longer be open to new customers starting May 31, 2026.
If you would like to use CloudTrail Lake, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[CloudTrail Lake availability change](cloudtrail-lake-service-availability-change.md).

This section describes the AWS CLI commands you can use to create, update, and manage your CloudTrail Lake event data stores.

When using the AWS CLI,
remember that your commands run in the AWS Region configured for your profile. If
you want to run the commands in a different Region, either change the default Region for
your profile, or use the **--region** parameter with the command.

## Available commands for event data stores

Commands for creating and updating event data stores in CloudTrail Lake include:

- `create-event-data-store` to create an event data store.

- `get-event-data-store` to return information about the event data store
including the advanced event selectors configured for the event data store.

- `update-event-data-store` to change the configuration of an
existing event data store.

- `list-event-data-stores` to list the event data stores.

- `delete-event-data-store` to delete an event data store.

- `restore-event-data-store` to restore an event data store that is pending deletion.

- `start-import` to start an import of trail events to an event data store, or retry a failed import.

- `get-import` to return information about a specific import.

- `stop-import` to stop an import of trail events to an event data store.

- `list-imports` to return information on all imports, or a select set of imports by `ImportStatus` or `Destination`.

- `list-import-failures` to list import failures for the specified import.

- `stop-event-data-store-ingestion` to stop event ingestion on an event data store.

- `start-event-data-store-ingestion` to restart event ingestion on an event data store.

- `enable-federation` to enable federation on an event data store to query the event data store in Amazon Athena.

- `disable-federation` to disable federation on an event data store. After you disable federation,
you can no longer query against the event data store's data in Amazon Athena. You can continue to query in CloudTrail Lake.

- `put-insight-selectors` to add or
modify Insights event selectors for an existing event data store, and enable or disable
Insights events.

- `get-insight-selectors` to return information about
Insights event selectors configured for an event data store.

- `add-tags` to add one or more tags (key-value pairs) to
an existing event data store.

- `remove-tags` to remove one or more tags from a
event data store.

- `list-tags` to return a list of tags associated with a
event data store.

- [get-event-configuration](lake-cli-manage-eds.md#lake-cli-get-event-configuration) to return any resource tag keys and IAM global
conditions keys configured for the event data store. The command also returns whether the event
data store is configured to collect `Standard` size events or `Large` size events.

- [put-event-configuration](lake-cli-manage-eds.md#lake-cli-put-event-configuration) to expand the event size and add or remove
resource tag keys and IAM global condition keys. For more information, see
[Enrich CloudTrail events by adding resource tag keys and IAM global condition keys](cloudtrail-context-events.md).

- `put-resource-policy` to attach a resource-based policy to an event data store.
Resource-based polices allow you to control which principals can perform actions on your event data store.
For example policies, see [Resource-based policy examples for event data stores](security-iam-resource-based-policy-examples.md#security_iam_resource-based-policy-examples-eds).

- `get-resource-policy` to get the resource-based policy attached to an event data store.

- `delete-resource-policy` to delete the resource-based policy attached to an event data store.
