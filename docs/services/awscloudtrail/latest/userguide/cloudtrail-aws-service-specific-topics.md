## AWS service integrations with CloudTrail logs

###### Note

You can also use CloudTrail Lake to query and analyze your events. CloudTrail Lake queries offer a
deeper and more customizable view of events than simple key and value lookups in **Event history**,
or running `LookupEvents`. CloudTrail Lake users can run complex Standard Query Language (SQL) queries across multiple fields in a CloudTrail event. For more information, see
[Working with AWS CloudTrail Lake](cloudtrail-lake.md) and [Copying trail events to CloudTrail Lake](cloudtrail-copy-trail-to-lake.md).

CloudTrail Lake event data stores and queries incur CloudTrail charges. For more information about
CloudTrail Lake pricing, see [AWS CloudTrail\
Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing).

You can configure other AWS services to further analyze and act upon the event data
collected in CloudTrail logs. For more information, see the following topics.

AWS ServiceTopicDescriptionAmazon Athena[Querying AWS CloudTrail Logs](../../../athena/latest/ug/cloudtrail-logs.md)

Using Athena with CloudTrail logs is a powerful way to enhance your
analysis of AWS service activity. For example, you can use queries to
identify trends and further isolate activity by attribute, such as
source IP address or user.

You can automatically create tables for querying logs directly
from the CloudTrail console, and use those tables to run queries in Athena. For
more information, see [Creating a Table for CloudTrail Logs in the CloudTrail\
Console](../../../athena/latest/ug/cloudtrail-logs.md#create-cloudtrail-table-ct) in the [Amazon Athena User Guide](../../../athena/latest/ug.md).

###### Note

Running queries in Amazon Athena incurs additional costs. For more
information, see [Amazon Athena Pricing.](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/pricing)

Amazon CloudWatch Logs[Monitoring CloudTrail Log Files with Amazon CloudWatch Logs](monitor-cloudtrail-log-files-with-cloudwatch-logs.md)

You can configure CloudTrail with CloudWatch Logs to monitor your trail logs and be notified when specific
activity occurs. For example, you can define CloudWatch Logs metric filters that
will trigger CloudWatch alarms and send notifications to you when those alarms
are triggered.

###### Note

Standard pricing for Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon CloudWatch Logs
applies. For more information, see [Amazon\
CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing).

## CloudTrail integration with Amazon EventBridge

Amazon EventBridge is an AWS service that delivers a near real-time stream of system
events that describe changes in AWS resources. In EventBridge, you can create rules that
responds to events recorded by CloudTrail. For more information, see [Create a rule in Amazon EventBridge](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-get-started.md#eb-gs-create-rule).

You can deliver events that you are subscribed to on your trail to EventBridge by creating a rule with the EventBridge console.

From the EventBridge console:

- Choose the `AWS API Call via CloudTrail`
detail-type to deliver CloudTrail data and management events with an `eventType` of `AwsApiCall`. To record events with a detail-type value of `AWS API Call via CloudTrail`, you must have a trail
that is currently logging management or data events.

- Choose the `AWS Console Sign In via CloudTrail`
detail-type to deliver [AWS Management Console sign-in\
events](cloudtrail-event-reference-aws-console-sign-in-events.md). To record events with a detail-type
of `AWS Console Sign In via CloudTrail`, you must have a trail that is currently logging management events.

- Choose the `AWS Insight via
                          CloudTrail` detail-type to deliver Insights events. To record events with a detail-type value of `AWS Insight via CloudTrail`, you must have a trail that is currently logging Insights events.
For information about logging Insights events, see [Working with CloudTrail Insights](logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.md).

For more information about how to create a trail, see [Creating a trail with the CloudTrail console](cloudtrail-create-a-trail-using-the-console-first-time.md).

## CloudTrail integration with AWS Organizations

The management account for an AWS Organizations organization can add a [delegated administrator](cloudtrail-delegated-administrator.md) to manage the organization's CloudTrail resources.
You can create an organization trail or organization event data store in the management account or delegated administrator account for an organization that collects all event data for all AWS
accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations. Creating an [organization trail](creating-trail-organization.md) or [organization event data store](cloudtrail-lake-organizations.md) helps you define
a uniform event logging strategy for your organization.

## CloudTrail integration with AWS Control Tower

AWS Control Tower sets up a new CloudTrail organization trail logging management events when you set up a landing zone. When you enroll an account
into AWS Control Tower, your account is governed by the organization trail for the AWS Control Tower organization. If you have an existing organization trail in that account, you may see
duplicate charges unless you delete the existing trail for the account before you enroll it in AWS Control Tower. You can view the **Trails** page on the CloudTrail console to see whether any organization trails have been created. For more information about AWS Control Tower, see
[About logging in AWS Control Tower](../../../controltower/latest/userguide/about-logging.md) in the _AWS CloudTrail User Guide_.

## CloudTrail integration with Amazon Security Lake

Security Lake can collect logs associated with CloudTrail management events and CloudTrail data events for S3 and Lambda. For more information, see
[CloudTrail event logs](../../../security-lake/latest/userguide/internal-sources.md#cloudtrail-event-logs) in the _Amazon Security Lake User Guide_.

To collect CloudTrail management events in Security Lake, you must have at least one CloudTrail multi-Region organization trail that collects read and write CloudTrail management events.

## CloudTrail Lake integration with Amazon Athena

You can federate an event data store to see the metadata associated with the event data store in the AWS Glue
[Data Catalog](../../../glue/latest/dg/components-overview.md#data-catalog-intro) and run SQL queries on the event data
using Amazon Athena. The table metadata stored in the AWS Glue Data Catalog
lets the Athena query engine know how to find, read, and process the data that you want to query. For more information, see [Federate an event data store](query-federation.md).

## CloudTrail Lake integration with AWS Config

You can create an event data store to include [AWS Config configuration items](../../../config/latest/developerguide/config-concepts.md#config-items), and use
the event data store to investigate non-compliant changes to your production
environments. For more information, see [Create an event data store for configuration items with the console](query-event-data-store-config.md).

## CloudTrail Lake integration with AWS Audit Manager

You can create an event data store for AWS Audit Manager evidence by using the Audit Manager console.
For more information about aggregating evidence in CloudTrail Lake using Audit Manager, see [Understanding how evidence finder works with CloudTrail Lake](../../../audit-manager/latest/userguide/evidence-finder.md#understanding-evidence-finder) in the
_AWS Audit Manager User Guide_.

## AWS service topics for CloudTrail

You can learn more about how the events for individual AWS services are recorded in
CloudTrail logs, including example events for that service in log files. For more information
about how specific AWS services integrate with CloudTrail, see the topic about integration
in the individual guide for that service.

Services that are still in preview, or not yet released for general availability (GA),
or which don't have public APIs, are not considered supported.

###### Note

To see the list of supported Regions for each service, see [Service endpoints and quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.md) in the
_Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

For information about which services log data events, see [Data events](logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.md#logging-data-events).
