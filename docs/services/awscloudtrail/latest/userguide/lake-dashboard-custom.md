# Create a custom dashboard with the CloudTrail console

You can create custom dashboards and add up to 10 widgets to each custom dashboard.
You can choose to add sample widgets or create new widgets from SQL queries.

After you're done adding widgets, you can manually refresh the dashboard or set a
refresh schedule.

###### To create a custom dashboard

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail).

2. In the left navigation pane, under **Lake**, choose
    **Dashboard**.

3. Choose the **Managed and custom dashboards** tab.

4. Choose **Build my own dashboard**.

5. Provide a dashboard name to identify your dashboard.

6. For **Permissions**, choose the event data stores that you
    want to apply permissions to. Because CloudTrail runs queries to populate data for the
    widgets on a dashboard, CloudTrail requires permissions to run queries on the event
    data stores associated with the dashboard's widgets. For each event data store
    selected in this step, CloudTrail attaches a resource-based policy to the event data
    store that allows CloudTrail to run queries on the event data store for this
    dashboard.

7. (Optional) In the **Tags** section, you can add up to 50 tag
    key pairs to help you identify and sort your dashboards. For more information
    about how you can use tags in AWS, see [Tagging\
    AWS resources](../../../tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.md) in the _Tagging AWS Resources User_
_Guide_.

8. Choose **Create dashboard**.

Next, you can add widgets and [set a\
    refresh schedule](lake-dashboard-refresh.md).
