# Cross-service confused deputy prevention

The confused deputy problem is a security issue where an entity that doesn't have
permission to perform an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform the action.
In AWS, cross-service impersonation can result in the confused deputy problem.
Cross-service impersonation can occur when one service (the _calling_
_service_) calls another service (the _called service_). The
calling service can be manipulated to use its permissions to act on another customer's
resources in a way it should not otherwise have permission to access. To prevent this, AWS
provides tools that help you protect your data for all services with service principals that
have been given access to resources in your account.

We recommend using the [`aws:SourceArn`](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-condition-keys.md#condition-keys-sourcearn) and [`aws:SourceAccount`](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-condition-keys.md#condition-keys-sourceaccount) global condition context keys in resource
policies to limit the permissions that AWS CloudTrail gives another service to the
resource. Use `aws:SourceArn` if you want only one resource to be associated with
the cross-service access. Use `aws:SourceAccount` if you want to allow any
resource in that account to be associated with the cross-service use.

The most effective way to protect against the confused deputy problem is to use the
`aws:SourceArn` global condition context key with the full ARN of the resource. If you don't
know the full ARN of the resource or if you are specifying multiple resources, use the
`aws:SourceArn` global context condition key with wildcards ( `*`) for the unknown
portions of the ARN. For example,
`"arn:aws:cloudtrail:*:AccountID:trail/*"`. When you include a
wildcard, you must also use the `StringLike` condition operator.

The value of `aws:SourceArn` must be the ARN of the trail, event data store, or channel that is using the resource.

The following example shows how you can use the `aws:SourceArn` and
`aws:SourceAccount` global condition context keys in CloudTrail to prevent the confused
deputy problem: [Amazon S3 bucket policy for CloudTrail Lake query results](s3-bucket-policy-lake-query-results.md).
