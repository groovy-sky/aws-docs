# Managing CloudTrail trail costs

You can configure and manage CloudTrail trails in ways that capture the data you
need while remaining cost-effective. For more information about CloudTrail pricing, see [AWS CloudTrail Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing).

## Trail configuration

CloudTrail offers flexibility in how you configure trails in your account. Some decisions
that you make during the setup process require that you understand the impacts to your
CloudTrail bill. The following are examples of how trail configurations can influence your
CloudTrail bill.

**Multiple trail creation**

The first copy of management events within each region is delivered free
of charge. For example, if your account has 2 single-Region trails, a trail
in `us-east-1` and another trail in `us-west-2`, there
are no CloudTrail charges because there is only one trail logging events in each
respective Region. However, if your account has a multi-Region trail and an
additional single-Region trail, the single-Region trail will incur charges
because the multi-Region trail is already logging events in each Region.

If you create more trails that deliver the same management events to other
destinations, those subsequent deliveries incur CloudTrail costs. You can do this
to allow different user groups (such as developers, security personnel, and
IT auditors) to receive their own copies of log files. For data events, all
deliveries incur CloudTrail costs, including the first.

As you create more trails, it is especially important to be familiar with
your logs, and understand the types and volumes of events that are generated
by resources in your account. This helps you anticipate the volume of events
that are associated with an account, and plan for trail costs. For example,
using AWS KMS-managed server-side encryption (SSE-KMS) on your S3 buckets can
result in a large number of AWS KMS management events in CloudTrail. Larger volumes
of events across multiple trails can also influence costs.

To help limit the number of events that are logged to
your trail, you can filter out AWS KMS or Amazon RDS Data API events by choosing
**Exclude AWS KMS events** or **Exclude Amazon RDS**
**Data API events** on the **Create trail** or
**Update trail** pages. When using basic event
selectors, you can only filter management events. However, you can use
advanced event selectors to filter both management and data events.

You can use advanced event selectors to include or exclude data events, giving you
the ability to log only the data events of interest. For more information, see [Filtering data events by using advanced event selectors](filtering-data-events.md).

You can use advanced event selectors to include or exclude network activity events based on the
`eventName`, `resources.type`, `resources.ARN`
, `errorCode`, and `vpcEndpointId` fields, giving you
the ability to log only the data events of interest. For more information, see [Logging network activity events](logging-network-events-with-cloudtrail.md).

For more information
about creating and updating a trail, see [Creating a trail with the CloudTrail console](cloudtrail-create-a-trail-using-the-console-first-time.md)
or [Updating a trail with the CloudTrail console](cloudtrail-update-a-trail-console.md) in this
guide.

**AWS Organizations**

When you set up an Organizations trail with CloudTrail, CloudTrail replicates the trail to each
member account within your organization. The new trail is created
_in addition to_ any existing trails in member
accounts. Be sure that the configuration of your organization trail matches
how you want trails configured for all accounts within an organization,
because the organization trail configuration propagates to all
accounts.

Because Organizations creates a trail in each member account, an individual member
account that creates an additional trail to collect the same management
events as the Organizations trail is collecting a second copy of events. The account
is charged for the second copy. Similarly, if an account has a multi-Region
trail, and creates a second trail in a single Region to collect the same
management events as the multi-Region trail, the trail in the single Region
is delivering a second copy of events. The second copy incurs
charges.
