# Updating a resource to use your KMS key with the console

On the CloudTrail console, update a trail or an event data store to use an KMS key. Be
aware that using your own KMS key incurs AWS KMS costs for encryption and decryption. For
more information, see [AWS Key Management Service\
Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing).

## Update a trail to use a KMS key

To update a trail to use the AWS KMS key that you modified for CloudTrail, complete the
following steps in the CloudTrail console.

###### Note

If you are using an existing S3 bucket with an [S3 Bucket\
Key](../../../s3/latest/userguide/bucket-key.md), CloudTrail must be allowed permission in the key policy to use the AWS KMS
actions `GenerateDataKey` and `DescribeKey`. If
`cloudtrail.amazonaws.com` is not granted those permissions in the
key policy, you cannot create or update a trail.

To update a trail using the AWS CLI, see [Enabling and disabling encryption for CloudTrail log files, digest files and event data stores with the AWS CLI](cloudtrail-log-file-encryption-cli.md).

###### To update a trail to use your KMS key

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail).

2. Choose **Trails** and then choose a trail name.

3. In **General details**, choose
    **Edit**.

4. For **Log file SSE-KMS encryption**, choose
    **Enabled** if you want to encrypt your log files and digest files using
    SSE-KMS encryption instead of SSE-S3 encryption. The default is **Enabled**. If you don't enable SSE-KMS encryption,
    your log files and digest files are encrypted using SSE-S3 encryption. For
    more information about SSE-KMS encryption, see [Using server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)](../../../s3/latest/userguide/usingkmsencryption.md). For
    more information about SSE-S3 encryption, see [Using Server-Side Encryption with\
    Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys (SSE-S3)](../../../s3/latest/userguide/usingserversideencryption.md).

Choose **Existing** to update your trail with your
    AWS KMS key. Choose a KMS key that is in the same Region as the S3 bucket
    that receives your log files. To verify the Region for an S3 bucket, view its
    properties in the S3 console.

###### Note

You can also type the ARN of a key from another account. For more
information, see [Updating a resource to use your KMS key with the console](create-kms-key-policy-for-cloudtrail-update-trail.md). The
key policy must allow CloudTrail to use the key to encrypt your log files and digest files, and
allow the users you specify to read log files or digest files in unencrypted form. For
information about manually editing the key policy, see [Configure AWS KMS key policies for CloudTrail](create-kms-key-policy-for-cloudtrail.md).

In **AWS KMS Alias**, specify the alias for which you changed
    the policy for use with CloudTrail, in the format
    `alias/` `MyAliasName`. For more
    information, see [Updating a resource to use your KMS key with the console](create-kms-key-policy-for-cloudtrail-update-trail.md).

You can type the alias name, ARN, or the globally unique key ID. If the
    KMS key belongs to another account, verify that the key policy has permissions
    that enable you to use it. The value can be one of the following formats:

- **Alias Name**:
`alias/MyAliasName`

- **Alias ARN**:
`arn:aws:kms:region:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName`

- **Key ARN**:
`arn:aws:kms:region:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`

- **Globally unique key ID**:
`12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`

5. Choose **Update trail**.

###### Note

If the KMS key that you chose is disabled or is pending deletion, you
cannot save the trail with that KMS key. You can enable the KMS key or
choose another one. For more information, see [Key state: Effect on your\
KMS key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.md) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer_
_Guide_.

## Update an event data store to use a KMS key

To update an event data store to use the AWS KMS key that you modified for CloudTrail,
complete the following steps in the CloudTrail console.

To update an event data store by using the AWS CLI, see [Update an event data store with the AWS CLI](lake-cli-update-eds.md).

###### Important

Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing CloudTrail permissions on the key,
prevents CloudTrail from ingesting events into the event data store, and prevents users
from querying data in the event data store that was encrypted with the key. After
you associate an event data store with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be removed
or changed. Before you disable or delete a KMS key that you are using with an
event data store, delete or back up your event data store.

###### To update an event data store to use your KMS key

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Event data stores** in
    **Lake**. Choose an event data store to update.

3. In **General details**, choose
    **Edit**.

4. For **Encryption**, if it is not already enabled, choose
    **Use my own AWS KMS key** to encrypt your event data store
    with your own KMS key.

Choose **Existing** to update your event data store with your
    KMS key. Choose a KMS key that is in the same Region as the event data
    store. A key from another account is not supported.

In **Enter AWS KMS Alias**, specify the alias for which you
    changed the policy for use with CloudTrail, in the format
    `alias/` `MyAliasName`. For more
    information, see [Updating a resource to use your KMS key with the console](create-kms-key-policy-for-cloudtrail-update-trail.md).

You can choose an alias, or use the globally unique key ID. The value can be
    one of the following formats:

- **Alias Name**:
`alias/MyAliasName`

- **Alias ARN**:
`arn:aws:kms:region:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName`

- **Key ARN**:
`arn:aws:kms:region:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`

- **Globally unique key ID**:
`12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`

5. Choose **Save changes**.

###### Note

If the KMS key that you chose is disabled or is pending deletion, you
cannot save the event data store configuration with that KMS key. You can
enable the KMS key, or choose a different key. For more information, see
[Key state: Effect on your\
KMS key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.md) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer_
_Guide_.
