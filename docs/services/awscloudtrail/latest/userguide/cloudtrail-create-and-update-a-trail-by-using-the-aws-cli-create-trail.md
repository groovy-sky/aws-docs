# Using the `create-trail` command to create a trail

You can run the `create-trail` command to create trails that are
specifically configured to meet your business needs. When using the AWS CLI, remember that
your commands run in the AWS Region configured for your profile. If you want to run
the commands in a different Region, either change the default Region for your profile,
or use the **--region** parameter with the command.

## Creating a multi-Region trail

A trail can be applied to all AWS Regions that are [enabled](../../../accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-regions.md#manage-acct-regions-enable-standalone) in your AWS account, or can be applied to a single Region. A trail that applies to
all AWS Regions that are enabled in your AWS account is referred to as a _multi-Region trail_. As a best practice, we recommend creating
a multi-Region trail because it captures activity in all enabled Regions.

To create a multi-Region trail, use the
`--is-multi-region-trail` option. By default, the
`create-trail` command creates a trail that logs events only in the
AWS Region where the trail was created. To ensure that you log global service
events and capture all management event activity in your AWS account, you should
create trails that log events in all AWS Regions.

###### Note

When you create a trail, if you specify an Amazon S3 bucket that was not created
with CloudTrail, you need to attach the appropriate policy. See [Amazon S3 bucket policy for CloudTrail](create-s3-bucket-policy-for-cloudtrail.md).

The following example creates a multi-Region trail with the name
`my-trail` and a tag with a key named
`Group` with a value of
`Marketing` that delivers logs from all enabled Regions in your account to an
existing bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail create-trail --name my-trail --s3-bucket-name amzn-s3-demo-bucket --is-multi-region-trail --tags-list [key=Group,value=Marketing]
```

To confirm that your trail is a multi-Region trail, verify that the
`IsMultiRegionTrail` element in the output shows
`true`.

```JSON

{
    "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents": true,
    "Name": "my-trail",
    "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/my-trail",
    "LogFileValidationEnabled": false,
    "IsMultiRegionTrail": true,
    "IsOrganizationTrail": false,
    "S3BucketName": "amzn-s3-demo-bucket"
}
```

###### Note

Use the `start-logging` command to start logging for your
trail.

## Start logging for the trail

After the `create-trail` command completes, run the
`start-logging` command to start logging for that trail.

###### Note

When you create a trail with the CloudTrail console, logging is turned on
automatically.

The following example starts logging for a trail.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail start-logging --name my-trail
```

This command doesn't return an output, but you can use the
`get-trail-status` command to verify that logging has
started.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name my-trail
```

To confirm that the trail is logging, the `IsLogging` element in
the output shows `true`.

```JSON

{
    "LatestDeliveryTime": 1441139757.497,
    "LatestDeliveryAttemptTime": "2015-09-01T20:35:57Z",
    "LatestNotificationAttemptSucceeded": "2015-09-01T20:35:57Z",
    "LatestDeliveryAttemptSucceeded": "2015-09-01T20:35:57Z",
    "IsLogging": true,
    "TimeLoggingStarted": "2015-09-01T00:54:02Z",
    "StartLoggingTime": 1441068842.76,
    "LatestDigestDeliveryTime": 1441140723.629,
    "LatestNotificationAttemptTime": "2015-09-01T20:35:57Z",
    "TimeLoggingStopped": ""
}
```

## Creating a single-Region trail

The following command creates a single-Region trail. The specified Amazon S3 bucket
must already exist and have the appropriate CloudTrail permissions applied. For more
information, see [Amazon S3 bucket policy for CloudTrail](create-s3-bucket-policy-for-cloudtrail.md).

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail create-trail --name my-trail --s3-bucket-name amzn-s3-demo-bucket
```

The following is example output.

```JSON

{
    "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents": true,
    "Name": "my-trail",
    "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/my-trail",
    "LogFileValidationEnabled": false,
    "IsMultiRegionTrail": false,
    "IsOrganizationTrail": false,
    "S3BucketName": "amzn-s3-demo-bucket"
}
```

## Creating a multi-Region trail that has log file validation enabled

To enable log file validation when using `create-trail`, use the
`--enable-log-file-validation` option.

For information about log file validation, see [Validating CloudTrail log file integrity](cloudtrail-log-file-validation-intro.md).

The following example creates a multi-Region trail that delivers logs to the
specified bucket. The command uses the `--enable-log-file-validation`
option.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail create-trail --name my-trail --s3-bucket-name amzn-s3-demo-bucket --is-multi-region-trail --enable-log-file-validation
```

To confirm that log file validation is enabled, the
`LogFileValidationEnabled` element in the output shows
`true`.

```JSON

{
    "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents": true,
    "Name": "my-trail",
    "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/my-trail",
    "LogFileValidationEnabled": true,
    "IsMultiRegionTrail": true,
    "IsOrganizationTrail": false,
    "S3BucketName": "amzn-s3-demo-bucket"
}
```
