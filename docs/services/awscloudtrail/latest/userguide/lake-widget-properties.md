## Table
<a name="lake-widget-table"></a>

The following example shows a widget configured as a table.

```
{
    "ViewProperties": {
       "Height": "2",
       "Width": "4",
       "Title": "TopErrors",
       "View": "Table"
    },
    "QueryStatement": "SELECT errorCode, COUNT(*) AS eventCount FROM eds WHERE eventTime > '?' AND eventTime < '?' AND (errorCode is not null) GROUP BY errorCode ORDER BY eventCount DESC LIMIT 100",
    "QueryParameters": ["$StartTime$", "$EndTime$"]
}
```

The following table describes the configurable view properties for a table.

       "XAxisColumn": "eventDate",
       "FilterColumn": "readOnly"
    },
    "QueryStatement": "SELECT DATE_TRUNC('?', eventTime) AS eventDate, IF(readOnly, 'read', 'write') AS readOnly, COUNT(*) as eventCount FROM eds WHERE eventTime > '?' AND eventTime < '?' GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('?', eventTime), readOnly ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('?', eventTime), readOnly",
    "QueryParameters": ["$Period$", "$StartTime$", "$EndTime$", "$Period$", "$Period$"]
