<a name="cloudtrail-read-log-files"></a>

Log files are in JSON format. If you have a JSON viewer add-on installed, you can view the files directly in your browser. Double-click the log file name in the bucket to open a new browser window or tab. The JSON displays in a readable format.

CloudTrail log files are Amazon S3 objects. You can use the Amazon S3 console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or the Amazon S3 API to retrieve log files.

For more information, see [Amazon S3 objects overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingObjects.html) in the* Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.*

The following procedure describes how to download a log file with the AWS Management Console.

**To download and read a log file**

1. Open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).

1. Choose the bucket and choose the log file that you want to download.

1. Choose **Download** or **Download as** and follow the prompts to save the file. This saves the file in compressed format.
**Note**
Some browsers, such as Chrome, automatically extract the log file for you. If your browser does this for you, skip to step 5.

1. Use a product such as [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the log file.

1. Open the log file in a text editor such as Notepad\+\+.
