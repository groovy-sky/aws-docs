# Create an integration to log events from outside AWS with the AWS CLI

This section describes how you can use the AWS CLI to create a CloudTrail Lake integration to log events from outside of AWS.

In the AWS CLI, you create an integration in four commands (three if you already have an event data store that meets the
criteria). Event data stores that you use as the destinations for an integration
must be for a single Region and single account; they cannot be multi-region, they
cannot log events for organizations in AWS Organizations, and they can only include activity events.
The event type in the console must be **Events from**
**integrations**. In the API, the `eventCategory`
value must be `ActivityAuditLog`. For more information
about integrations, see [Create an integration with an event source outside of AWS](query-event-data-store-integration.md).

1. Run [**create-event-data-store**](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudtrail/index.html) to create an
    event data store, if you do not already have one or more event data stores
    that you can use for the integration.

The following example AWS CLI command creates an event data store that logs
    events from outside AWS. For activity events, the
    `eventCategory` field selector value is
    `ActivityAuditLog`. The event data store has a retention
    period of 90 days set. By default, the event data store collects events from
    all Regions, but because this is collecting non-AWS events, set it to a
    single Region by adding the `--no-multi-region-enabled` option.
    Termination protection is enabled by default, and the event data store does
    not collect events for accounts in an organization.

```JSON

aws cloudtrail create-event-data-store \
   --name my-event-data-store \
   --no-multi-region-enabled \
   --retention-period 90 \
   --advanced-event-selectors '[
       {
         "Name": "Select all external events",
         "FieldSelectors": [
             { "Field": "eventCategory", "Equals": ["ActivityAuditLog"] }
           ]
       }
     ]'
```

The following is an example response.

```JSON

{
       "EventDataStoreArn": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:123456789012:eventdatastore/EXAMPLEf852-4e8f-8bd1-bcf6cEXAMPLE",
       "Name": "my-event-data-store",
       "AdvancedEventSelectors": [
           {
              "Name": "Select all external events",
              "FieldSelectors": [
                 {
                     "Field": "eventCategory",
                     "Equals": [
                         "ActivityAuditLog"
                       ]
                   }
               ]
           }
       ],
       "MultiRegionEnabled": true,
       "OrganizationEnabled": false,
       "BillingMode": "EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING",
       "RetentionPeriod": 90,
       "TerminationProtectionEnabled": true,
       "CreatedTimestamp": "2023-10-27T10:55:55.384000-04:00",
       "UpdatedTimestamp": "2023-10-27T10:57:05.549000-04:00"
}
```

You'll need the event data store ID (the suffix of the ARN, or
    `EXAMPLEf852-4e8f-8bd1-bcf6cEXAMPLE` in the preceding
    response example) to go on to the next step and create your channel.

2. Run the [**create-channel**](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudtrail/create-channel.html) command to create a
    channel that allows a partner or source application to send events to an
    event data store in CloudTrail.

A channel has the following components:

**Source**

CloudTrail uses this information to determine the partners that are
sending event data to CloudTrail on your behalf. A source is required,
and can be either `Custom` for all valid non-AWS
events, or the name of a partner event source. A maximum of one
channel is allowed per source.

For information about the `Source` values for available partners, see [Additional information about integration partners](query-event-data-store-integration.md#cloudtrail-lake-partner-information).

**Ingestion status**

The channel status shows when the last events were received
from a channel source.

**Destinations**

The destinations are the CloudTrail Lake event data stores that are
receiving events from the channel. You can change destination
event data stores for a channel.

To stop receiving events from a source, delete the channel.

You need the ID of at least one destination event data store to run this
    command. The valid type of destination is `EVENT_DATA_STORE`. You
    can send ingested events to more than one event data store. The following
    example command creates a channel that sends events to two event data
    stores, represented by their IDs in the `Location` attribute of
    the `--destinations` parameter. The `--destinations`,
    `--name`, and `--source` parameters are required.
    To ingest events from a CloudTrail partner, specify the name of the partner as the
    value of `--source`. To ingest events from your own applications
    outside AWS, specify `Custom` as the value of
    `--source`.

```JSON

aws cloudtrail create-channel \
       --region us-east-1 \
       --destinations '[{"Type": "EVENT_DATA_STORE", "Location": "EXAMPLEf852-4e8f-8bd1-bcf6cEXAMPLE"}, {"Type": "EVENT_DATA_STORE", "Location": "EXAMPLEg922-5n2l-3vz1- apqw8EXAMPLE"}]'
       --name my-partner-channel \
       --source $partnerSourceName \
```

In the response to your **create-channel** command, copy
    the ARN of the new channel. You need the ARN to run
    the `put-resource-policy` and `put-audit-events` commands in the next steps.

3. Run the **put-resource-policy** command to attach a resource policy to the channel.
    Resource policies are JSON policy documents that specify what actions a specified principal can perform on the resource and
    under what conditions. The accounts defined as principals in the channel's resource
    policy can call the `PutAuditEvents` API to deliver events.

###### Note

If you do not create a resource policy for the channel, only the channel owner can call the `PutAuditEvents` API on the channel.

The information required for the policy is determined by the integration
    type.

- For a direction integration, CloudTrail requires the policy to contain
the partner's AWS account IDs, and requires you to enter the
unique external ID provided by the partner. CloudTrail automatically adds
the partner's AWS account IDs to the resource policy when you
create an integration using the CloudTrail console. Refer to the [partner's documentation](query-event-data-store-integration.md#cloudtrail-lake-partner-information#lake-integration-partner-documentation)
to learn how to get the AWS account numbers required for the policy.

- For a solution integration, you
must specify at least one AWS account ID as principal, and can optionally enter an external ID to prevent against confused deputy.

The following are requirements for the resource policy:

- The resource ARN defined in the policy must match the channel ARN the policy is attached to.

- The policy contains only one action: cloudtrail-data:PutAuditEvents

- The policy contains at least one statement. The policy can have a maximum of 20
statements.

- Each statement contains at least one principal. A statement can have a maximum of 50 principals.

```JSON

aws cloudtrail put-resource-policy \
    --resource-arn "channelARN" \
    --policy "{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement":
    [
        {
            "Sid": "ChannelPolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal":
            {
                "AWS":
                [
                    "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root",
                    "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:root",
                    "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "cloudtrail-data:PutAuditEvents",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:777788889999:channel/EXAMPLE-80b5-40a7-ae65-6e099392355b",
            "Condition":
            {
                "StringEquals":
                {
                    "cloudtrail:ExternalId": "UniqueExternalIDFromPartner"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}"

```

For more information about resource policies, see [AWS CloudTrail resource-based policy examples](security-iam-resource-based-policy-examples.md).

4. Run the [`PutAuditEvents`](../../../../reference/awscloudtraildata/latest/apireference/api-putauditevents.md) API to ingest
    your activity events into CloudTrail. You'll need the payload of events that
    you want CloudTrail to add. Be sure that there is no sensitive or
    personally-identifying information in event payload before ingesting it into
    CloudTrail. Note that the `PutAuditEvents` API uses the
    `cloudtrail-data` CLI endpoint, not the
    `cloudtrail` endpoint.

The following examples show how to use the
    **put-audit-events** CLI command. The
    **--audit-events** and **--channel-arn**
    parameters are required. The **--external-id** parameter
    is required if an external ID is defined in the resource policy. You
    need the ARN of the channel that you created in
    the preceding step. The value of **--audit-events** is a JSON
    array of event objects. `--audit-events` includes a required ID
    from the event, the required payload of the event as the value of
    `EventData`, and an [optional checksum](#lake-cli-integration-checksum.title)
    to help validate the integrity of the event after ingestion into
    CloudTrail.

```JSON

aws cloudtrail-data put-audit-events \
   --channel-arn $ChannelArn \
   --external-id $UniqueExternalIDFromPartner \
   --audit-events \
id="event_ID",eventData='"{event_payload}"' \
id="event_ID",eventData='"{event_payload}"',eventDataChecksum="optional_checksum"
```

The following is an example command with two event examples.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail-data put-audit-events \
   --channel-arn arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:123456789012:channel/EXAMPLE8-0558-4f7e-a06a-43969EXAMPLE \
   --external-id UniqueExternalIDFromPartner \
   --audit-events \
id="EXAMPLE3-0f1f-4a85-9664-d50a3EXAMPLE",eventData='"{\"eventVersion\":\0.01\",\"eventSource\":\"custom1.domain.com\", ...
\}"' \
id="EXAMPLE7-a999-486d-b241-b33a1EXAMPLE",eventData='"{\"eventVersion\":\0.02\",\"eventSource\":\"custom2.domain.com\", ...
\}"',eventDataChecksum="EXAMPLE6e7dd61f3ead...93a691d8EXAMPLE"
```

The following example command adds the `--cli-input-json`
    parameter to specify a JSON file ( `custom-events.json`)
    of event payload.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail-data put-audit-events --channel-arn $channelArn --external-id $UniqueExternalIDFromPartner --cli-input-json file://custom-events.json --region us-east-1
```

The following are the sample contents of the example JSON file,
    `custom-events.json`.

```JSON

{
       "auditEvents": [
         {
           "eventData": "{\"version\":\"eventData.version\",\"UID\":\"UID\",
           \"userIdentity\":{\"type\":\"CustomUserIdentity\",\"principalId\":\"principalId\",
           \"details\":{\"key\":\"value\"}},\"eventTime\":\"2021-10-27T12:13:14Z\",\"eventName\":\"eventName\",
           \"userAgent\":\"userAgent\",\"eventSource\":\"eventSource\",
           \"requestParameters\":{\"key\":\"value\"},\"responseElements\":{\"key\":\"value\"},
           \"additionalEventData\":{\"key\":\"value\"},
           \"sourceIPAddress\":\"12.34.56.78\",\"recipientAccountId\":\"152089810396\"}",
           "id": "1"
         }
      ]
}
```

You can verify that the integration is working, and CloudTrail is ingesting events from
the source correctly, by running the [**get-channel**](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudtrail/get-channel.html) command. The output of
**get-channel** shows the most recent time stamp that CloudTrail
received events.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail get-channel --channel arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:01234567890:channel/EXAMPLE8-0558-4f7e-a06a-43969EXAMPLE
```

## (Optional) Calculate a checksum value

The checksum that you specify as the value of `EventDataChecksum`
in a `PutAuditEvents` request helps you verify that CloudTrail receives the
event that matches with the checksum; it helps verify the integrity of events.
The checksum value is a base64-SHA256 algorithm that you calculate by running
the following command.

```JSON

printf %s "{"eventData": "{\"version\":\"eventData.version\",\"UID\":\"UID\",
        \"userIdentity\":{\"type\":\"CustomUserIdentity\",\"principalId\":\"principalId\",
        \"details\":{\"key\":\"value\"}},\"eventTime\":\"2021-10-27T12:13:14Z\",\"eventName\":\"eventName\",
        \"userAgent\":\"userAgent\",\"eventSource\":\"eventSource\",
        \"requestParameters\":{\"key\":\"value\"},\"responseElements\":{\"key\":\"value\"},
        \"additionalEventData\":{\"key\":\"value\"},
        \"sourceIPAddress\":\"source_IP_address\",
        \"recipientAccountId\":\"recipient_account_ID\"}",
        "id": "1"}" \
 | openssl dgst -binary -sha256 | base64
```

The command returns the checksum. The following is an example.

```nohighlight

EXAMPLEDHjkI8iehvCUCWTIAbNYkOgO/t0YNw+7rrQE=
```

The checksum value becomes the value of `EventDataChecksum` in your
`PutAuditEvents` request. If the checksum doesn't match with the
one for the provided event, CloudTrail rejects the event with an
`InvalidChecksum` error.
