# Updating a trail with the CloudTrail console

This section describes how to change trail settings.

To convert a single-Region trail to a multi-Region trail, or update a multi-Region
trail to log events in only a single Region, you must use the AWS CLI. For more information
about how to convert a single-Region trail to a multi-Region trail, see [Converting a single-Region trail to a multi-Region trail](cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail-by-using-the-aws-cli-update-trail.md#cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail-by-using-the-aws-cli-examples-convert).
For more information about how to update a multi-Region trail to log events in a single Region, see [Converting a multi-Region trail to a single-Region trail](cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail-by-using-the-aws-cli-update-trail.md#cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail-by-using-the-aws-cli-examples-reduce).

If you've enabled CloudTrail management events in Amazon Security Lake, you are required to maintain at least one organizational trail that is multi-Region and logs both `read` and `write` management events. You cannot update a
qualifying trail in such a way that it fails to meet the Security Lake requirement. For example, by changing the trail to single-Region, or by turning off the logging of `read` or `write` management events.

###### Note

CloudTrail updates organization trails in member accounts even
if a resource validation fails. Examples of validation failures include:

- an incorrect Amazon S3 bucket policy

- an incorrect Amazon SNS topic policy

- inability to deliver to a CloudWatch Logs log group

- insufficient permission to encrypt using a KMS key

A member account with CloudTrail permissions can see any validation failures for an organization trail by viewing the trail's
details page on the CloudTrail console, or by running the AWS CLI [get-trail-status](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudtrail/get-trail-status.md) command.

###### To update a trail with the AWS Management Console

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Trails**, and then choose a
     trail name.

03. In **General details**, choose **Edit** to
     change the following settings. You cannot change the name of a trail.

- **Apply trail to my organization** \- Change whether this
trail is an AWS Organizations organization trail.

###### Note

Only the management account for the organization can convert
an organization trail to a non-organization trail,
or convert a non-organization trail to an organization trail.

- **Trail log location** \- Change the name of the S3 bucket
or prefix in which you are storing logs for this trail.

- **Log file SSE-KMS encryption** \- Choose to enable or
disable encrypting log files with SSE-KMS instead of SSE-S3.

- **Log file validation** \- Choose to enable or disable
validation of the integrity of log files.

- **SNS notification delivery** \- Choose to enable or
disable Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications that log files have been delivered
to the bucket specified for the trail.

    1. To change the trail to an AWS Organizations organization trail, you can choose to
        enable the trail for all accounts in your organization. For more
        information, see [Creating a trail for an organization](creating-trail-organization.md).

    2. To change the specified bucket in **Storage location**,
        choose **Create new S3 bucket** to create a bucket. When
        you create a bucket, CloudTrail creates and applies the required bucket
        policies. If you choose to create
        a new S3 bucket, your IAM policy needs to include permission for the
        `s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration` action because by
        default server-side encryption is enabled for the bucket.

       ###### Note

       If you chose **Use existing S3 bucket**, specify a
       bucket in **Trail log bucket name**, or choose
       **Browse** to choose a bucket. The bucket policy
       must grant CloudTrail permission to write to it. For information about
       manually editing the bucket policy, see [Amazon S3 bucket policy for CloudTrail](create-s3-bucket-policy-for-cloudtrail.md).

       To make it easier to find your logs, create a new folder (also known as a
        _prefix_) in an existing bucket to
        store your CloudTrail logs. Enter the prefix in
        **Prefix**.

    3. For **Log file SSE-KMS encryption**, choose
        **Enabled** if you want to encrypt your log files and digest files using
        SSE-KMS encryption instead of SSE-S3 encryption. The default is **Enabled**. If you don't enable SSE-KMS encryption,
        your log files and digest files are encrypted using SSE-S3 encryption. For
        more information about SSE-KMS encryption, see [Using server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)](../../../s3/latest/userguide/usingkmsencryption.md). For
        more information about SSE-S3 encryption, see [Using Server-Side Encryption with\
        Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys (SSE-S3)](../../../s3/latest/userguide/usingserversideencryption.md).

       If you enable SSE-KMS encryption, choose a **New** or
        **Existing** AWS KMS key. In
        **AWS KMS Alias**, specify an alias, in the format
        `alias/` `MyAliasName`. For more
        information, see [Updating a resource to use your KMS key with the console](create-kms-key-policy-for-cloudtrail-update-trail.md).
        CloudTrail also supports AWS KMS multi-Region keys. For more information about
        multi-Region keys, see [Using\
        multi-Region keys](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.md) in the _AWS Key Management Service_
       _Developer Guide_.

       ###### Note

       You can also type the ARN of a key from another account. For more
       information, see [Updating a resource to use your KMS key with the console](create-kms-key-policy-for-cloudtrail-update-trail.md).
       The key policy must allow CloudTrail to use the key to encrypt your log files and digest files,
       and allow the users you specify to read log files or digest files in unencrypted form.
       For information about manually editing the key policy, see [Configure AWS KMS key policies for CloudTrail](create-kms-key-policy-for-cloudtrail.md).

    4. For **Log file validation**, choose
        **Enabled** to have log digests delivered to your S3
        bucket. You can use the digest files to verify that your log files did not
        change after CloudTrail delivered them. For more information, see [Validating CloudTrail log file integrity](cloudtrail-log-file-validation-intro.md).

    5. For **SNS notification delivery**, choose
        **Enabled** to be notified each time a log is delivered
        to your bucket. CloudTrail stores multiple events in a log file. SNS notifications
        are sent for every log file, not for every event. For more information, see
        [Configuring Amazon SNS notifications for CloudTrail](configure-sns-notifications-for-cloudtrail.md).

       If you enable SNS notifications, for **Create a new SNS**
       **topic**, choose **New** to create a topic, or
        choose **Existing** to use an existing topic. If you are
        creating multi-Region trail, SNS notifications for log file
        deliveries from all enabled Regions are sent to the single SNS topic that you
        create.

       If you choose **New**, CloudTrail specifies a name for the new
        topic for you, or you can type a name. If you choose
        **Existing**, choose an SNS topic from the drop-down
        list. You can also enter the ARN of a topic from another Region or from an
        account with appropriate permissions. For more information, see [Amazon SNS topic policy for CloudTrail](cloudtrail-permissions-for-sns-notifications.md).

       If you create a topic, you must subscribe to the topic to be notified of
        log file delivery. You can subscribe from the Amazon SNS console. Due to the
        frequency of notifications, we recommend that you configure the subscription
        to use an Amazon SQS queue to handle notifications programmatically. For more
        information, see [Getting started with Amazon SNS](../../../sns/latest/dg/sns-getting-started.md)
        in the _Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide_.
04. In **CloudWatch Logs**, choose **Edit** to change settings
     for sending CloudTrail log files to CloudWatch Logs. Choose **Enabled** in
     **CloudWatch Logs** to enable sending log files. For more information,
     see [Sending events to CloudWatch Logs](send-cloudtrail-events-to-cloudwatch-logs.md).
    1. If you enable integration with CloudWatch Logs, choose **New** to
        create a new log group, or **Existing** to use an existing
        one. If you choose **New**, CloudTrail specifies a name for the
        new log group for you, or you can type a name.

    2. If you choose **Existing**, choose a log group from the
        drop-down list.

    3. Choose **New** to create a new IAM role for permissions
        to send logs to CloudWatch Logs. Choose **Existing** to choose an
        existing IAM role from the drop-down list. The policy statement for the
        new or existing role is displayed when you expand **Policy**
       **document**. For more information about this role, see [Role policy document for CloudTrail to use CloudWatch Logs for monitoring](cloudtrail-required-policy-for-cloudwatch-logs.md).

       ###### Note

- When you configure a trail, you can choose an S3 bucket and SNS
topic that belong to another account. However, if you want CloudTrail to
deliver events to a CloudWatch Logs log group, you must choose a log group
that exists in your current account.

- Only the management account can configure
a CloudWatch Logs log group for an organization trail using the console. The delegated administrator can configure a CloudWatch Logs
log group using the AWS CLI or CloudTrail `CreateTrail` or `UpdateTrail` API operations.
05. In **Tags**, choose **Edit** to change, add, or
     delete tags on the trail. You can add up to 50 tag key pairs to
     help you identify, sort, and control access to your trail. Tags can help you identify both your CloudTrail trails and the Amazon S3 buckets that
     contain CloudTrail log files. You can then use resource groups for your CloudTrail resources.
     For more information, see [AWS Resource Groups](../../../arg/latest/userguide/resource-groups.md) and [Tags](cloudtrail-concepts.md#cloudtrail-concepts-tags).

06. In **Management events**, choose **Edit** to
     change management event logging settings.
    1. For **API activity**, choose if you want your trail to
        log **Read** events, **Write** events, or
        both. For more information, see [Management events](logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.md#logging-management-events).

    2. Choose **Exclude AWS KMS events** to filter AWS Key Management Service
        (AWS KMS) events out of your trail. The default setting is to include all
        AWS KMS events.

       The option to log or exclude AWS KMS events is available only if you log
        management events on your trail. If you choose not to log management events,
        AWS KMS events are not logged, and you cannot change AWS KMS event logging
        settings.

       AWS KMS actions such as `Encrypt`, `Decrypt`, and
        `GenerateDataKey` typically generate a large volume (more
        than 99%) of events. These actions are now logged as
        **Read** events. Low-volume, relevant AWS KMS actions
        such as `Disable`, `Delete`, and
        `ScheduleKey` (which typically account for less than 0.5% of
        AWS KMS event volume) are logged as **Write** events.

       To exclude high-volume events like `Encrypt`,
        `Decrypt`, and `GenerateDataKey`, but still log
        relevant events such as `Disable`, `Delete` and
        `ScheduleKey`, choose to log **Write**
        management events, and clear the check box for **Exclude AWS KMS**
       **events**.

    3. Choose **Exclude Amazon RDS Data API events** to filter
        Amazon Relational Database Service Data API events out of your trail. The default setting is to
        include all Amazon RDS Data API events. For more information about Amazon RDS Data API
        events, see [Logging Data API calls with AWS CloudTrail](../../../amazonrds/latest/aurorauserguide/logging-using-cloudtrail-data-api.md) in the
        _Amazon RDS User Guide for Aurora_.
07. ###### Important

    Steps 7-11 are for configuring data events using advanced event selectors, which is the default. Advanced event selectors let you configure
    more [data event\
    types](logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.md#logging-data-events) and offer fine-grained control over which data events your
    trail captures. If you plan to log network activity events, you must use advanced event selectors. If
    you are using basic event selectors, see [Updating data event settings with basic event selectors](#cloudtrail-update-basic-event-selectors-console), then
    return to step 12 of this procedure.

    In **Data events**, choose **Edit** to change
     data event logging settings. By default, trails don't log data events. Additional charges
     apply for logging data events. For CloudTrail
     pricing, see [AWS CloudTrail\
     Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing).

    For **Resource type**, choose the resource type on which
     you want to log data events. For more information about available resource types, see [Data events](logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.md#logging-data-events).

08. Choose a log selector template. You can choose a predefined template, or choose **Custom**
     to define your own event collection conditions.

    You can choose from the following predefined
     templates:

- **Log all events** –
Choose this template to log all events.

- **Log only read events** –
Choose this template to log only read events.
Read-only events are events that do not change the
state of a resource, such as `Get*` or `Describe*`
events.

- **Log only write events** – Choose this template to log only write events.
Write events add, change, or delete resources, attributes, or artifacts,
such as `Put*`, `Delete*`, or `Write*` events.

- **Log only AWS Management Console events** –
Choose this template to log only events originating from the AWS Management Console.

- **Exclude AWS service initiated events** – Choose this template to exclude
AWS service events, which have an `eventType` of `AwsServiceEvent`,
and events initiated with AWS service-linked roles (SLRs).

###### Note

Choosing a predefined template for S3 buckets enables data event logging
for all buckets currently in your AWS account and any buckets you create
after you finish creating the trail. It also enables logging of data event
activity performed by any user or role in your AWS account, even if that
activity is performed on a bucket that belongs to another AWS
account.

If the trail applies only to one Region, choosing a predefined template
that logs all S3 buckets enables data event logging for all buckets in the
same Region as your trail and any buckets you create later in that Region.
It will not log data events for Amazon S3 buckets in other Regions in your AWS
account.

If you're creating a multi-Region trail, choosing a predefined
template for Lambda functions enables data event logging for all functions
currently in your AWS account, and any Lambda functions you might create in
any Region after you finish creating the trail. If you are creating a trail
for a single Region (done by using the AWS CLI), this selection enables data
event logging for all functions currently in that Region in your AWS
account, and any Lambda functions you might create in that Region after you
finish creating the trail. It does not enable data event logging for Lambda
functions created in other Regions.

Logging data events for all functions also enables logging of data event
activity performed by any user or role in your AWS account, even if that
activity is performed on a function that belongs to another AWS
account.

09. (Optional) In **Selector name**, enter a name to identify your selector. The selector name is a
     descriptive name for an advanced event selector, such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets". The selector name is listed as `Name` in the
     advanced event selector and is viewable if you expand the
     **JSON view**.

10. If you selected **Custom**, in **Advanced event selectors** build an expression based on the values of advanced event selector fields.

    ###### Note

    Selectors don't support the use of wildcards like `*` . To match multiple values with a single condition,
    you may use `StartsWith`, `EndsWith`, `NotStartsWith`, or `NotEndsWith` to explicitly match the beginning or end of the event field.

    1. Choose from the following fields.

- **`readOnly`**
\- `readOnly` can be set to
**equals** a value of
`true` or `false`. Read-only
data events are events that do not change the state of a
resource, such as `Get*` or
`Describe*` events. Write events add,
change, or delete resources, attributes, or artifacts,
such as `Put*`, `Delete*`, or
`Write*` events. To log both
`read` and `write` events,
don't add a `readOnly` selector.

- **`eventName`** -
`eventName` can use any operator. You can
use it to include or exclude any data event logged to
CloudTrail, such as `PutBucket`,
`GetItem`, or
`GetSnapshotBlock`.

- **`eventSource`** – The event source to include or exclude. This field can use any operator.

- **eventType** – The event type to include or exclude. For example, you can set this field to
**not equals** `AwsServiceEvent` to exclude
[AWS service events](non-api-aws-service-events.md). For a list of event types,
see [eventType](cloudtrail-event-reference-record-contents.md#ct-event-type) in
[CloudTrail record contents for management, data, and network activity events](cloudtrail-event-reference-record-contents.md).

- **sessionCredentialFromConsole** – Include or exclude events originating from an AWS Management Console session. This field can be set to **equals** or **not equals** with a value of
`true`.

- **userIdentity.arn** – Include or exclude events for actions taken by specific IAM identities. For more information, see [CloudTrail userIdentity element](cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.md).

- **`resources.ARN`** \- You can use
any operator with `resources.ARN`, but if you
use **equals** or
**does not equal**, the value must
exactly match the ARN of a valid resource of the type
you've specified in the template as the value of
`resources.type`.

###### Note

You can't use the `resources.ARN` field to filter resource types that do not have ARNs.

For more information about the ARN formats of data event
resources, see [Actions, resources, and condition\
keys for AWS services](../../../service-authorization/latest/reference/reference-policies-actions-resources-contextkeys.md) in the _Service Authorization Reference_.

    2. For each field, choose **\+ Condition** to
        add as many conditions as you need, up to a maximum of 500
        specified values for all conditions. For example, to exclude
        data events for two S3 buckets from data events that are logged
        on your event data store, you can set the field to
        **resources.ARN**, set the operator for
        **does not start with**, and then paste in
        an S3 bucket ARN for which you do
        not want to log events.

       To add the second S3 bucket, choose **+**
       **Condition**, and then repeat the preceding
        instruction, pasting in the ARN for or browsing for a different
        bucket.

       For information about how CloudTrail evaluates multiple conditions, see
        [How CloudTrail evaluates multiple conditions for a field](filtering-data-events.md#filtering-data-events-conditions).

       ###### Note

       You can have a maximum of 500 values for all selectors on
       an event data store. This includes arrays of multiple values for a
       selector such as `eventName`. If you have single
       values for all selectors, you can have a maximum of 500
       conditions added to a selector.

    3. Choose **\+ Field** to add additional fields
        as required. To avoid errors, do not set conflicting or
        duplicate values for fields. For example, do not specify an ARN
        in one selector to be equal to a value, then specify that the
        ARN not equal the same value in another selector.
11. To add another resource type on which to log data events, choose **Add**
    **data event type**. Repeat steps 3 through this step to configure
     advanced event selectors for the resource type.

12. In **Network activity events**, choose **Edit**
     to change network activity event logging settings. By default, trails don't log
     network activity events. Additional charges apply for logging network activity
     events. For more information, see [AWS CloudTrail Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing).

    To log network activity events, do the following:
    1. From **Network activity event source**, choose the source for network activity events.

    2. In **Log selector template**, choose a template.
        You can choose to log all network activity events, log all network activity access denied events, or choose **Custom** to
        build a custom log selector to filter on multiple fields, such as `eventName` and `vpcEndpointId`.

    3. (Optional) Enter a name to identify the selector. The selector name is listed as **Name** in the advanced event selector and is viewable if you expand the
        **JSON view**.

    4. In **Advanced event**
       **selectors** build expressions by choosing values for **Field**,
        **Operator**, and **Value**. You can skip this step if you are using a predefined log template.
       1. For excluding or including network activity
           events, you can choose from the following fields in the console.

- **`eventName`** – You can use any operator with `eventName`.
You can use it to include or exclude any event, such as `CreateKey`.

- **`errorCode`** – You can use it to filter on an error code. Currently, the only supported `errorCode` is `VpceAccessDenied`.

- **`vpcEndpointId`** – Identifies the VPC endpoint that the operation passed through. You can use
any operator with `vpcEndpointId`.

       2. For each field, choose **\+ Condition** to add as many conditions as you need, up to a maximum of 500 specified values for all conditions.

       3. Choose **\+ Field** to add additional fields as required. To avoid errors, do not set conflicting or duplicate values for fields.
    5. To add another event source for which you want to log network activity events, choose **Add**
       **network activity event selector**.

    6. Optionally, expand **JSON view** to see your
        advanced event selectors as a JSON block.
13. In **Insights events**, choose **Edit** if you
     want your trail to log CloudTrail Insights events.

    In **Event type**, select **Insights events**.

     In **Insights events**, choose **API call**
    **rate**, **API error rate**, or both. You must be logging
     **Write** management events to
     log Insights events for **API call rate**. You must be logging
     **Read** or **Write** management events to
     log Insights events for **API error rate**.

    CloudTrail Insights analyzes management events for unusual activity, and logs events
     when anomalies are detected. By default, trails don't log Insights events. For more
     information about Insights events, see [Working with CloudTrail Insights](logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.md). Additional charges
     apply for logging Insights events. For CloudTrail pricing, see [AWS CloudTrail Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing).

    Insights events are delivered to a different folder named
     `/CloudTrail-Insight` of the same S3 bucket that is specified in the
     **Storage location** area of the trail details page. CloudTrail
     creates the new prefix for you. For example, if your current destination S3 bucket
     is named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket/AWSLogs/CloudTrail/`, the S3 bucket name with a
     new prefix is named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket/AWSLogs/CloudTrail-Insight/`.

14. When you are finished changing settings on your trail, choose **Update**
    **trail**.

## Updating data event settings with basic event selectors

You can use advanced event selectors to configure all data event types as well as network activity events.
Advanced event selectors allow you to create
fine-grained selectors to log only those events of interest.

If you use basic event selectors to log data events, you're limited
to logging data events for Amazon S3 buckets, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables.
You can't filter on the `eventName` field using basic event
selectors. You also can't log [network activity events](logging-network-events-with-cloudtrail.md).

![Basic event selectors for data events on a trail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/images/cloudtrail-data-basic-selectors.png)

Use the following procedure to configure data event settings using basic event selectors.

1. In **Data events**, choose **Edit** to change
    data event logging settings. With basic event selectors, you can specify logging
    data events for Amazon S3 buckets, AWS Lambda functions, DynamoDBtables, or a combination of those
    resources. Additional data event resource types are supported with advanced event
    selectors. By default, trails don't log data events. Additional charges
    apply for logging data events. For more information, see [Data events](logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.md#logging-data-events). For CloudTrail
    pricing, see [AWS CloudTrail\
    Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing).

For Amazon S3 buckets:
1. For **Data event source**, choose
       **S3**.

2. You can choose to log **All current and future S3**
      **buckets**, or you can specify individual buckets or functions.
       By default, data events are logged for all current and future S3
       buckets.

      ###### Note

      Keeping the default **All current and future S3**
      **buckets** option enables data event logging for all buckets
      currently in your AWS account and any buckets you create after you
      finish creating the trail. It also enables logging of data event
      activity performed by any user or role in your AWS account, even if
      that activity is performed on a bucket that belongs to another AWS
      account.

      If the trail applies only to one Region, choosing **All**
      **current and future S3 buckets** enables data event logging
      for all buckets in the same Region as your trail and any buckets you
      create later in that Region. It will not log data events for Amazon S3
      buckets in other Regions in your AWS account.

3. If you leave the default, **All current and future S3**
      **buckets**, choose to log **Read** events,
       **Write** events, or both.

4. To select individual buckets, empty the **Read** and
       **Write** check boxes for **All current and**
      **future S3 buckets**. In **Individual bucket**
      **selection**, browse for a bucket on which to log data events.
       To find specific buckets, type a bucket prefix for the bucket you want. You
       can select multiple buckets in this window. Choose **Add**
      **bucket** to log data events for more buckets. Choose to log
       **Read** events, such as `GetObject`,
       **Write** events, such as `PutObject`, or
       both.

      This setting takes precedence over individual settings you configure for
       individual buckets. For example, if you specify logging
       **Read** events for all S3 buckets, and then choose to
       add a specific bucket for data event logging, **Read** is
       already selected for the bucket you added. You cannot clear the selection.
       You can only configure the option for **Write**.

      To remove a bucket from logging, choose **X**.
2. To add another resource type on which to log data events, choose **Add data**
**event type**.

3. For Lambda functions:
1. For **Data event source**, choose
       **Lambda**.

2. In **Lambda function**, choose **All**
      **regions** to log all Lambda functions, or **Input**
      **function as ARN** to log data events on a specific function.

      To log data events for all Lambda functions in your AWS account, select
       **Log all current and future functions**. This setting
       takes precedence over individual settings you configure for individual
       functions. All functions are logged, even if all functions are not
       displayed.

      ###### Note

      If you're creating a multi-Region trail, this selection enables
      data event logging for all functions currently in your AWS account,
      and any Lambda functions you might create in any Region after you finish
      creating the trail. If you are creating a trail for a single Region
      (done by using the AWS CLI), this selection enables data event logging for
      all functions currently in that Region in your AWS account, and any
      Lambda functions you might create in that Region after you finish
      creating the trail. It does not enable data event logging for Lambda
      functions created in other Regions.

      Logging data events for all functions also enables logging of data
      event activity performed by any user or role in your AWS account, even
      if that activity is performed on a function that belongs to another
      AWS account.

3. If you choose **Input function as ARN**, enter the ARN of
       a Lambda function.

      ###### Note

      If you have more than 15,000 Lambda functions in your account, you
      cannot view or select all functions in the CloudTrail console when creating a
      trail. You can still select the option to log all functions, even if
      they are not displayed. If you want to log data events for specific
      functions, you can manually add a function if you know its ARN. You can
      also finish creating the trail in the console, and then use the AWS CLI
      and the **put-event-selectors** command to configure data
      event logging for specific Lambda functions. For more information, see
      [Managing trails with the AWS CLI](cloudtrail-additional-cli-commands.md).
4. To add another resource type on which to log data events, choose **Add data**
**event type**.

5. For DynamoDB tables:
1. For **Data event source**, choose
       **DynamoDB**.

2. In **DynamoDB table selection**, choose
       **Browse** to select a table, or paste in the ARN of a
       DynamoDB table to which you have access. A DynamoDB table ARN is in the following
       format:

      ```nohighlight

      arn:partition:dynamodb:region:account_ID:table/table_name
      ```

      To add another table, choose **Add row**, and browse for
       a table or paste in the ARN of a table to which you have access.
6. To configure Insights events and other settings for your trail, go back to the
    preceding procedure in this topic, [Updating a trail with the CloudTrail console](cloudtrail-update-a-trail-console.md).
