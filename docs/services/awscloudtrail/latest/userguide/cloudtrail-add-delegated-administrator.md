# Add a CloudTrail delegated administrator

You can add a delegated administrator to manage an organization's CloudTrail resources, such as trails and event data stores.

You can add a CloudTrail delegated administrator for your AWS
organization using the CloudTrail console or the AWS CLI.

Before you add a delegated administrator, be sure they have an account in your organization and you are signed in with the management account for your organization. For information about how to create a new AWS account for your organization, see

invite an existing AWS account to your organization, see [Inviting an AWS account to join your organization](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-manage-accounts-invites.md).
