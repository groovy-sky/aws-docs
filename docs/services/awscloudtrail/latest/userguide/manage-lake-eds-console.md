# Create, update, and manage event data stores with the console

###### Note

AWS CloudTrail Lake will no longer be open to new customers starting May 31, 2026.
If you would like to use CloudTrail Lake, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[CloudTrail Lake availability change](cloudtrail-lake-service-availability-change.md).

You can use the CloudTrail console to create, update, delete, and restore event data stores.

You can update the following settings using the CloudTrail console:

- You can change the [pricing option](cloudtrail-lake-manage-costs.md#cloudtrail-lake-manage-costs-pricing-option) from
**Seven-year retention pricing** to **One-year extendable retention pricing**.

- You can update the retention period for the event data store. The retention
period determines how long event data is kept in the event data store.

- You can convert a multi-Region event data store to a single-Region event data store,
or convert a single-Region event data store to a multi-Region event data store.

- The management account for an AWS Organizations organization can convert an
account-level event data store to an organization event data store, or can
convert an organization event data store to an account-level event data
store. This setting is not available on event data stores that collect events outside of AWS.

- You can enable or disable [Lake query federation](query-federation.md).
Federating an event data store allows you to query your event data from Amazon Athena.

- You can add or edit the resource-based policy for an event
data store to provide cross-account access to your event data store. For more information, see [Resource-based policy examples for event data stores](security-iam-resource-based-policy-examples.md#security_iam_resource-based-policy-examples-eds).

- You can [stop event ingestion](query-eds-stop-ingestion.md) and restart event ingestion on event data stores
that collect management events, data events, or AWS Config configuration items.

- You can enable or disable [termination protection](query-eds-termination-protection.md). Enabling termination protection protects an event data store from being accidentally deleted.
Termination protection is enabled by default.

- You can [restore](query-eds-restore.md) an event data store that is pending deletion.

- You can add or remove tags. You can add up to 50 tag key pairs to help you identify, sort, and control
access to your event data store.

- You can add a KMS key to encrypt your event data store. You can’t remove a KMS key from an event data store.

Using the CloudTrail console to create or update a event data stores provides the following advantages:

- If you're configuring an event data store to collect data events, using the CloudTrail
console allows you to view the available data event resource types. For more
information, see [Logging data events](logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.md).

- If you're configuring an event data store to collect network activity events, using the CloudTrail
console allows you to view the event sources for which you can log network activity events. For more
information, see [Logging network activity events](logging-network-events-with-cloudtrail.md).

- If you're configuring a event data store to collect events outside of AWS,
using the CloudTrail console lets you view information about available partners. For more information, see
[Create an event data store for events outside of AWS with the console](event-data-store-integration-events.md).
