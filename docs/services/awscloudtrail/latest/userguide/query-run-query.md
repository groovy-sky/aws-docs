# Run a query and save query results with the console

After you choose or save a query, you can run a query on an event data store.

When you run a query, you have the option to save the query results to an Amazon S3
bucket. When you run queries in CloudTrail Lake, you incur charges based on the amount of data
scanned by the query. There are no additional CloudTrail Lake charges for saving query results
to an S3 bucket, however, there are S3 storage charges. For more information about S3
pricing, see [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

When you save query results, the query results may display in the CloudTrail console before they
are viewable in the S3 bucket since CloudTrail delivers the query results after the query scan
completes. While most queries complete within a few minutes, depending on the size of
your event data store, it can take considerably longer for CloudTrail to deliver query results
to your S3 bucket. CloudTrail delivers the query results to the S3 bucket in compressed gzip
format. On average, after the query scan completes
you can expect a latency of 60 to 90 seconds for every GB of data delivered to the S3 bucket.

**To run a query using CloudTrail Lake**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail).

2. From the navigation pane, under **Lake**, choose **Query**.

3. On the **Saved queries** or **Sample**
**queries** tabs, choose a query to run by choosing the
    **Query name**.

4. On the **Editor** tab, for **Event data**
**store**, choose an event data store from the drop-down list.

5. (Optional) On the **Editor** tab, choose **Save**
**results to S3** to save the query results to an S3 bucket. When you
    choose the default S3 bucket, CloudTrail creates and applies the required bucket
    policies. If you choose the default S3 bucket, your IAM policy needs to include
    permission for the `s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration` action because by
    default server-side encryption is enabled for the bucket. For more information about saving
    query results, see [Additional information about saved query results](#save-query-results).

###### Note

To use a different bucket, specify a bucket name, or choose
**Browse S3** to choose a bucket. The bucket policy
must grant CloudTrail permission to deliver query results to the bucket. For
information about manually editing the bucket policy, see [Amazon S3 bucket policy for CloudTrail Lake query results](s3-bucket-policy-lake-query-results.md).

6. On the **Editor** tab, choose
    **Run**.

Depending on the size of your event data store, and the number of days of data
    it includes, a query can take several minutes to run. The **Command**
**output** tab shows the status of a query, and whether a query is
    finished running. When a query has finished running, open the **Query**
**results** tab to see a table of results for the active query (the
    query currently shown in the editor).

###### Note

Queries that run for longer than one hour might time out. You can still get
partial results that were processed before the query timed out. CloudTrail does not
deliver partial query results to an S3 bucket. To avoid a time out, you can refine
your query to limit the amount of data scanned by specifying a narrower time
range.

## Additional information about saved query results

After you save query results, you can download the saved query results from the S3
bucket. For more information about finding and downloading saved query results, see
[Download saved query results](view-download-cloudtrail-lake-query-results.md).

You can also validate saved query results to determine whether the query results
were modified, deleted, or unchanged after CloudTrail delivered the query results. For
more information about validating saved query results, see [Validate CloudTrail Lake saved query results](cloudtrail-query-results-validation.md).

## Example: Save query results to an Amazon S3 bucket

This walkthrough shows how you can save query results to an S3 bucket and then download those
query results.

###### To save query results to an Amazon S3 bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail).

2. From the navigation pane, under **Lake**, choose **Query**.

3. On the **Sample queries** or **Saved queries** tabs, choose a query to run by choosing the
    **Query name**. In this example, we'll choose the sample query named **Investigate user actions**.

4. On the **Editor** tab, for **Event data**
**store**, choose an event data store from the drop-down list. When you choose the event data store from the list,
    CloudTrail automatically populates the event data store ID in the `From` line.

5. In this sample query, we'll edit the `userIdentity.ARN` value to specify a
    user named `Admin`, and we'll leave the default values for `eventTime`.
    When you run a query, you're charged for the amount of data scanned. To help control costs, we
    recommend that you constrain queries by adding starting and ending `eventTime` time
    stamps to queries.

6. Choose **Save**
**results to S3** to save the query results to an S3 bucket. When you
    choose the default S3 bucket, CloudTrail creates and applies the required bucket
    policies. If you choose the default S3 bucket, your IAM policy needs to include
    permission for the `s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration` action because by
    default server-side encryption is enabled for the bucket.
    In this example, we'll use the default S3 bucket.

###### Note

To use a different bucket, specify a bucket name, or choose
**Browse S3** to choose a bucket. The bucket policy
must grant CloudTrail permission to deliver query results to the bucket. For
information about manually editing the bucket policy, see [Amazon S3 bucket policy for CloudTrail Lake query results](s3-bucket-policy-lake-query-results.md).

7. Choose
    **Run**. Depending on the size of your event data store, and the number of days of data
    it includes, a query can take several minutes to run. The **Command**
**output** tab shows the status of a query, and whether a query is
    finished running. When a query has finished running, open the **Query**
**results** tab to see a table of results for the active query (the
    query currently shown in the editor).

8. When CloudTrail completes delivery of the saved query results to your S3 bucket, the **Delivery status** column provides a link to the S3 bucket
    that contains your saved query result files as well as a [sign file](cloudtrail-query-results-validation.md#cloudtrail-results-file-validation-sign-file-structure) that you can use to verify your saved query results. Choose **View in S3** to view the query result files and sign files in the S3 bucket.

###### Note

When you save query results, the query results may display in the CloudTrail console before they
are viewable in the S3 bucket because CloudTrail delivers the query results after the query scan
completes. While most queries complete within a few minutes, depending on the size of
your event data store, it can take considerably longer for CloudTrail to deliver query results

you can expect a latency of 60 to 90 seconds for every GB of data delivered to the S3 bucket.

9. To download your query results, choose the query result file (in this example, `result_1.csv.gz`) and then choose **Download**.
