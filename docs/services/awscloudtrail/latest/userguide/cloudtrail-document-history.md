management events and enables Insights and a destination event data store that
collects Insights events based upon unusual management event activity in the

conditions are met: the data event API call is from a different AWS account
than the Amazon S3 bucket owner, and the API caller received an
`AccessDenied` error that was only for the caller account. For
more information, see [Redacting bucket owner account IDs for data events\
called by other accounts](cloudtrail-receive-logs-from-multiple-accounts.md#cloudtrail-receive-logs-s3-owner-id-redaction).
