# Using the `update-trail` command to update a trail

###### Important

As of November 22, 2021, AWS CloudTrail changed how trails
capture global service events. Now, events created by Amazon CloudFront, AWS Identity and Access Management, and
AWS STS are recorded in the Region in which they were created, the US East (N. Virginia)
Region, us-east-1. This makes how CloudTrail treats these services consistent with
that of other AWS global services. To continue receiving global service events outside of
US East (N. Virginia), be sure to convert _single-Region trails_ using global
service events outside of US East (N. Virginia) into _multi-Region trails_.
For more information about capturing global service events, see [Enabling and disabling global service event logging](#cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail-by-using-the-aws-cli-examples-gses)
later in this section.

In contrast, the **Event history** in the CloudTrail console and the **aws cloudtrail lookup-events** command will show these events
in the AWS Region where they occurred.

You can use the `update-trail` command to change the configuration settings
for a trail. You can also use the **add-tags** and
**remove-tags** commands to add and remove tags for a trail. You can
only update trails from the AWS Region where the trail was created (its Home Region).
When using the AWS CLI, remember that your commands run in the AWS Region configured for
your profile. If you want to run the commands in a different Region, either change the
default Region for your profile, or use the **--region** parameter with
the command.

If you've enabled CloudTrail management events in Amazon Security Lake, you are required to maintain at least one organizational trail that is multi-Region and logs both `read` and `write` management events. You cannot update a
qualifying trail in such a way that it fails to meet the Security Lake requirement. For example, by changing the trail to single-Region, or by turning off the logging of `read` or `write` management events.

###### Note

If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs to modify a trail, be sure that the
trail's bucket policy is up-to-date. In order for your bucket to automatically
receive events from a new AWS Region, the policy must contain the full service
name, `cloudtrail.amazonaws.com`. For more information, see [Amazon S3 bucket policy for CloudTrail](create-s3-bucket-policy-for-cloudtrail.md).

## Converting a single-Region trail to a multi-Region trail

To change an existing single-Region trail to a multi-Region trail, use the
`--is-multi-region-trail` option.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail update-trail --name my-trail --is-multi-region-trail
```

To confirm that the trail is now a multi-Region trail, verify that the
`IsMultiRegionTrail` element in the output shows
`true`.

```JSON

{
    "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents": true,
    "Name": "my-trail",
    "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/my-trail",
    "LogFileValidationEnabled": false,
    "IsMultiRegionTrail": true,
    "IsOrganizationTrail": false,
    "S3BucketName": "amzn-s3-demo-bucket"
}
```

## Converting a multi-Region trail to a single-Region trail

To change an existing multi-Region trail so that it applies only to the Region in
which it was created, use the `--no-is-multi-region-trail` option.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail update-trail --name my-trail --no-is-multi-region-trail
```

To confirm that the trail now applies to a single Region, the
`IsMultiRegionTrail` element in the output shows
`false`.

```JSON

{
    "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents": true,
    "Name": "my-trail",
    "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/my-trail",
    "LogFileValidationEnabled": false,
    "IsMultiRegionTrail": false,
    "IsOrganizationTrail": false,
    "S3BucketName": "amzn-s3-demo-bucket"
}
```

## Enabling and disabling global service event logging

To change a trail so that it does not log global service events, use the
`--no-include-global-service-events` option.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail update-trail --name my-trail --no-include-global-service-events
```

To confirm that the trail no longer logs global service events, the
`IncludeGlobalServiceEvents` element in the output shows `false`.

```JSON

{
    "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents": false,
    "Name": "my-trail",
    "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/my-trail",
    "LogFileValidationEnabled": false,
    "IsMultiRegionTrail": false,
    "IsOrganizationTrail": false,
    "S3BucketName": "amzn-s3-demo-bucket"
}
```

To change a trail so that it logs global service events, use the
`--include-global-service-events` option.

Single-Region trails will no longer receive global service events beginning November 22, 2021,
unless the trail already appears in US East (N. Virginia) Region, us-east-1. To
continue capturing global service events, update the trail configuration to a
multi-Region trail. For example, this command updates a single-Region trail in
US East (Ohio), us-east-2, into a multi-Region trail. Replace `myExistingSingleRegionTrailWithGSE` with the appropriate trail name for your configuration.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail --region us-east-2 update-trail --name myExistingSingleRegionTrailWithGSE --is-multi-region-trail
```

Because global service events are only available in US East (N. Virginia) beginning
November 22, 2021, you can also create a single-Region trail to subscribe to global service events in the
US East (N. Virginia) Region, us-east-1. The following command creates a single-Region
trail in us-east-1 to receive CloudFront, IAM, and AWS STS events:

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail --region us-east-1 create-trail --include-global-service-events --name myTrail --s3-bucket-name amzn-s3-demo-bucket
```

## Enabling log file validation

To enable log file validation for a trail, use the
`--enable-log-file-validation` option. Digest files are delivered to
the Amazon S3 bucket for that trail.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail update-trail --name my-trail --enable-log-file-validation
```

To confirm that log file validation is enabled, the
`LogFileValidationEnabled` element in the output shows
`true`.

```JSON

{
    "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents": true,
    "Name": "my-trail",
    "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/my-trail",
    "LogFileValidationEnabled": true,
    "IsMultiRegionTrail": false,
    "IsOrganizationTrail": false,
    "S3BucketName": "amzn-s3-demo-bucket"
}
```

## Disabling log file validation

To disable log file validation for a trail, use the
`--no-enable-log-file-validation` option.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail update-trail --name my-trail-name --no-enable-log-file-validation
```

To confirm that log file validation is disabled, the
`LogFileValidationEnabled` element in the output shows
`false`.

```JSON

{
    "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents": true,
    "Name": "my-trail",
    "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/my-trail",
    "LogFileValidationEnabled": false,
    "IsMultiRegionTrail": false,
    "IsOrganizationTrail": false,
    "S3BucketName": "amzn-s3-demo-bucket"
}
```
