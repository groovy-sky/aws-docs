# Using AWS CloudTrail with interface VPC endpoints
<a name="cloudtrail-and-interface-VPC"></a>

If you use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to host your AWS resources, you can establish a private connection between your VPC and AWS CloudTrail. You can use this connection to enable CloudTrail to communicate with your resources on your VPC without going through the public internet.

Amazon VPC is an AWS service that you can use to launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. With a VPC, you have control over your network settings, such the IP address range, subnets, route tables, and network gateways. With VPC endpoints, the routing between the VPC and AWS services is handled by the AWS network, and you can use IAM policies to control access to service resources.

To connect your VPC to CloudTrail, you define an *interface VPC endpoint* for CloudTrail. An interface endpoint is an elastic network interface with a private IP address that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported AWS service. The endpoint provides reliable, scalable connectivity to CloudTrail without requiring an internet gateway, network address translation (NAT) instance, or VPN connection. For more information, see [What is Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, an AWS technology that enables private communication between AWS services using an elastic network interface with private IP addresses. For more information, see [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/).

The following sections are for users of Amazon VPC. For more information, see [Get started with Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-getting-started.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

## Regions
<a name="cloudtrail-interface-VPC-availability"></a>

AWS CloudTrail supports VPC endpoints and VPC endpoint policies in all AWS Regions in which CloudTrail is supported.

## Create a VPC endpoint for CloudTrail
<a name="create-VPC-endpoint-for-CloudTrail"></a>

To start using CloudTrail with your VPC, create an interface VPC endpoint for CloudTrail. For more information, see [Access an AWS service using an interface VPC endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-interface-endpoint.html#create-interface-endpoint.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

You don't need to change the settings for CloudTrail. CloudTrail calls other AWS services using either public endpoints or private interface VPC endpoints, whichever are in use.

## Create a VPC endpoint policy for CloudTrail
<a name="create-VPC-endpoint-policy"></a>

A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource that you can attach to an interface VPC endpoint. The default endpoint policy gives you full access to CloudTrail APIs through the interface VPC endpoint. To control the access granted to CloudTrail from your VPC, attach a custom endpoint policy to the interface VPC endpoint.

An endpoint policy specifies the following information:
+ The principals that can perform actions (AWS accounts, IAM users, and IAM roles).
+ The actions that can be performed.
+ The resources on which actions can be performed.

For more information about VPC endpoint policies, including how to update a policy, see [Controlling access to services with VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-access.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

Following are examples of custom VPC endpoint policies for CloudTrail.

## Shared subnets
<a name="shared-subnet-cloudtrail"></a>

A CloudTrail VPC endpoint, like any other VPC endpoint, can only be created by an owner account in the shared subnet. However, a participant account can use CloudTrail VPC endpoints in subnets that are shared with the participant account. For more information about Amazon VPC sharing, see [Share your VPC with other accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.
