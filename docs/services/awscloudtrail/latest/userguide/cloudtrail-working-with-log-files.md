# Working with CloudTrail log files

You can perform more advanced tasks with your CloudTrail files.

- Monitor CloudTrail log files by sending them to CloudWatch Logs.

- Share log files between accounts.

- Use the AWS CloudTrail Processing Library to write log processing applications in
Java.

- Validate your log files to verify that they have not changed after delivery by
CloudTrail.

When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates whether the event matches the
settings for your trails. Only events that match your trail settings are delivered to your
Amazon S3 bucket and Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.

You can configure multiple trails differently so that the trails process and log only the
events that you specify. For example, one trail can log read-only data and management
events, so that all read-only events are delivered to one S3 bucket. Another trail can log
only write-only data and management events, so that all write-only events are delivered to a
separate S3 bucket.

You can also configure your trails to have one trail log and deliver all management events
to one S3 bucket, and configure another trail to log and deliver all data events to another
S3 bucket.

You can configure your trails to log the following:

- **[Data\**
**events](logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.md)**: These events provide visibility into the resource
operations performed on or within a resource. These are also known as data plane
operations.

- **[Management events](logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.md)**: Management events provide visibility
into management operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account.
These are also known as control plane operations. Management events can also include
non-API events that occur in your account. For example, when a user logs in to your
account, CloudTrail logs the `ConsoleLogin` event. For more information, see
[Non-API events captured by CloudTrail](cloudtrail-non-api-events.md).

- **[Network activity events](logging-network-events-with-cloudtrail.md)**: CloudTrail network activity events enable
VPC endpoint owners to record AWS API calls made using their VPC endpoints from a private VPC to the AWS service.
Network activity events provide visibility into the resource operations performed within a VPC.

- **[Insights events](logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.md)**: Insights events capture unusual activity that is detected
in your account. If you have Insights events enabled, and CloudTrail detects unusual activity,
Insights events are logged to the destination S3 bucket for your trail, but in a different
folder. You can also see the type of Insights event and the incident time period
when you view Insights events on the CloudTrail console. Unlike other types of events captured in a
CloudTrail trail, Insights events are logged only when CloudTrail detects changes in your account's API
usage that differ significantly from the account's typical usage patterns.

Insights events are generated only for management APIs. For more information, see [Working with CloudTrail Insights](logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.md).

###### Note

CloudTrail typically delivers logs within an average of about 5 minutes of an
API call. This time is not guaranteed. Review the [AWS CloudTrail Service Level Agreement](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/sla) for more
information.

If you misconfigure your trail (for example, the S3 bucket is unreachable),
CloudTrail will attempt to redeliver the log files to your S3 bucket for 30 days, and
these attempted-to-deliver events will be subject to standard CloudTrail charges.
To avoid charges on a misconfigured trail, you need to delete the trail.
