# Role policy document for CloudTrail to use CloudWatch Logs for monitoring

This section describes the permissions policy required for the CloudTrail role to send log events to
CloudWatch Logs. You can attach a policy document to a role when you configure CloudTrail to send events, as
described in [Sending events to CloudWatch Logs](send-cloudtrail-events-to-cloudwatch-logs.md). You can
also create a role using IAM. For more information, see [Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-service.md) or
[Creating an IAM role (AWS CLI)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-user.md#roles-creatingrole-user-cli).

The following example policy document contains the permissions required to create a CloudWatch log
stream in the log group that you specify and to deliver CloudTrail events to that log
stream in the US East (Ohio) Region. (This is the default policy for the default IAM role
`CloudTrail_CloudWatchLogs_Role`.)

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AWSCloudTrailCreateLogStream2014110",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogStream"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:us-east-2:111122223333:log-group:log_group_name:log-stream:CloudTrail_log_stream_name_prefix*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AWSCloudTrailPutLogEvents20141101",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:us-east-2:111122223333:log-group:log_group_name:log-stream:CloudTrail_log_stream_name_prefix*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

If you're creating a policy that might be used for organization trails as well, you will
need to modify it from the default policy created for the role. For example, the following
policy grants CloudTrail the permissions required to create a CloudWatch Logs log stream in the log group
you specify as the value of `log_group_name`, and to deliver CloudTrail
events to that log stream for both trails in the AWS account 111111111111 and for
organization trails created in the 111111111111 account that are applied to the
AWS Organizations organization with the ID of `o-exampleorgid`:

            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogStream"
            ],
            "Resource": [

                "arn:aws:logs:us-east-2:111111111111:log-group:log_group_name:log-stream:o-exampleorgid_*"
            ]
        },
        {
