# Create, update, and manage CloudTrail Lake integrations with the AWS CLI
<a name="lake-integrations-cli"></a>

This section describes the commands you can use to create, update and manage your CloudTrail Lake integrations using the AWS CLI.

When using the AWS CLI, remember that your commands run in the AWS Region configured for your profile. If you want to run the commands in a different Region, either change the default Region for your profile, or use the **--region** parameter with the command.
