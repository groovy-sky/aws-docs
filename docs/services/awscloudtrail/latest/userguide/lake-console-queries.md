# View sample queries with the CloudTrail console

The CloudTrail console provides a number of sample queries that can help you get started writing your
own queries.

CloudTrail queries incur charges based upon the amount of data scanned. To help control costs,
we recommend that you constrain queries by adding starting and ending `eventTime` time stamps to queries.
For more information about CloudTrail pricing, see [AWS CloudTrail\
Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing).

###### Note

You can also view queries created by the GitHub community. For more
information, see [CloudTrail\
Lake sample queries](https://github.com/aws-samples/cloud-trail-lake-query-samples) on the GitHub website. AWS CloudTrail has not evaluated the queries in GitHub.

###### To view and run a sample query

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail).

2. From the navigation pane, under **Lake**, choose **Query**.

3. On the **Query** page, choose the **Sample**
**queries** tab.

4. Choose a sample query from the list or enter a phrase to search by. In this example, we'll open the query **Investigate who made console changes** by choosing the **Query**
**name**. This opens the query in the **Editor** tab.

###### Note

By default, this page uses basic search functionality. You can improve the search functionality
by adding permissions for the `cloudtrail:SearchSampleQueries` action, if it is not
already provided by your permissions policy. The [`AWSCloudTrail_FullAccess`](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awscloudtrail-fullaccess.md)
managed policy provides permissions to perform the `cloudtrail:SearchSampleQueries` action.

5. On the **Editor** tab, choose the event data store for which you want to run the query. When you choose the event data store from the list,
    CloudTrail automatically populates the event data store ID in the `FROM` line of the query editor.

6. Choose **Run** to run the query.

The **Command output** tab shows you metadata about your query, such as whether the query was successful, the number of records matched, and the run time of the query.

The **Query results** tab shows you the event data in the selected event data store that matched your query.
