# Sending events to CloudWatch Logs

When you configure your trail to send events to CloudWatch Logs, CloudTrail sends only the events that
match your trail settings. For example, if you configure your trail to log data events only,
your trail sends data events only to your CloudWatch Logs log group. CloudTrail supports sending data, Insights, and
management events to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see [Working with CloudTrail log files](cloudtrail-working-with-log-files.md).

###### Note

Only the management account can configure
a CloudWatch Logs log group for an organization trail using the console. The delegated administrator can configure a CloudWatch Logs
log group using the AWS CLI or CloudTrail `CreateTrail` or `UpdateTrail` API operations.

To send events to a CloudWatch Logs log group:

- Make sure you have sufficient permissions to create or specify an IAM role. For
more information, see [Granting permission to view and configure Amazon CloudWatch Logs information on the CloudTrail console](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#grant-cloudwatch-permissions-for-cloudtrail-users).

- If you're configuring the CloudWatch Logs log group using the AWS CLI, make sure you have sufficient permissions to create a CloudWatch Logs log stream in
the log group you specify and to deliver CloudTrail events to that log stream. For
more information, see [Creating a policy document](#send-cloudtrail-events-to-cloudwatch-logs-cli-create-policy-document).

- Create a new trail or specify an existing one. For more information, see [Creating and updating a trail with the console](cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail-by-using-the-console.md).

- Create a log group or specify an existing one.

- Specify an IAM role. If you are modifying an existing IAM role for an
organization trail, you must manually update the policy to allow logging for the
organization trail. For more information, see [this\
policy example](#policy-cwl-org) and [Creating a trail for an organization](creating-trail-organization.md).

- Attach a role policy or use the default.

## Configuring CloudWatch Logs monitoring with the console

You can use the AWS Management Console to configure your trail to send events to CloudWatch Logs for
monitoring.

### Creating a log group or specifying an existing log group

CloudTrail uses a CloudWatch Logs log group as a delivery endpoint for log events. You can create
a log group or specify an existing one.

###### To create or specify a log group for an existing trail

1. Make sure you log in with an administrative user or role with sufficient
    permissions to configure CloudWatch Logs integration. For more information, see [Granting permission to view and configure Amazon CloudWatch Logs information on the CloudTrail console](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#grant-cloudwatch-permissions-for-cloudtrail-users).

###### Note

Only the management account can configure
a CloudWatch Logs log group for an organization trail using the console. The delegated administrator can configure a CloudWatch Logs
log group using the AWS CLI or CloudTrail `CreateTrail` or `UpdateTrail` API operations.

2. Open the CloudTrail console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail).

3. Choose the trail name. If you choose a multi-Region trail,
    you will be redirected to the Region in which the trail was created. You can
    create a log group or choose an existing log group in the same Region as the
    trail.

###### Note

A multi-Region trail sends log files from all enabled Regions
in your AWS account to the CloudWatch Logs log group that you specify.

4. In **CloudWatch Logs**, choose **Edit**.

5. For **CloudWatch Logs**, choose
    **Enabled**.

6. For **Log group name**, choose **New** to create a new log group, or
    **Existing** to use an existing one. If you
    choose **New**, CloudTrail specifies a name for the new
    log group for you, or you can type a name. For more information about naming,
    see [CloudWatch log group and log stream naming for CloudTrail](cloudwatch-log-group-log-stream-naming-for-cloudtrail.md).

7. If you choose **Existing**, choose a log group
    from the drop-down list.

8. For **Role name**, choose **New** to create a new IAM role for
    permissions to send logs to CloudWatch Logs. Choose
    **Existing** to choose an existing IAM role
    from the drop-down list. The policy statement for the new or
    existing role is displayed when you expand **Policy**
**document**. For more information about this role, see
    [Role policy document for CloudTrail to use CloudWatch Logs for monitoring](cloudtrail-required-policy-for-cloudwatch-logs.md).

###### Note

When you configure a trail, you can choose an S3 bucket and
SNS topic that belong to another account. However, if you want
CloudTrail to deliver events to a CloudWatch Logs log group, you must choose a
log group that exists in your current account.

9. Choose **Save changes**.

### Specifying an IAM role

You can specify a role for CloudTrail to assume to deliver events to the log
stream.

###### To specify a role

1. By default, the `CloudTrail_CloudWatchLogs_Role` is specified
    for you. The default role policy has the required permissions to create a
    CloudWatch Logs log stream in a log group that you specify, and to deliver CloudTrail events
    to that log stream.

###### Note

If you want to use this role for a log group for an organization
trail, you must manually modify the policy after you create the role.
For more information, see [this policy\
example](#policy-cwl-org) and [Creating a trail for an organization](creating-trail-organization.md).

1. To verify the role, go to the AWS Identity and Access Management console at
       [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. Choose **Roles** and then choose the
       **CloudTrail\_CloudWatchLogs\_Role**.

3. From the **Permissions** tab, expand the policy to view its contents.
2. You can specify another role, but you must attach the required role policy
    to the existing role if you want to use it to send events to CloudWatch Logs. For more
    information, see [Role policy document for CloudTrail to use CloudWatch Logs for monitoring](cloudtrail-required-policy-for-cloudwatch-logs.md).

### Viewing events in the CloudWatch console

After you configure your trail to send events to your CloudWatch Logs log group, you can
view the events in the CloudWatch console. CloudTrail typically delivers events to your log
group within an average of about 5 minutes of an API call. This time is not
guaranteed. Review the [AWS CloudTrail Service\
Level Agreement](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/sla) for more information.

###### To view events in the CloudWatch console

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the left navigation pane, under **Logs**, choose **Log groups**.

3. Choose the log group that you specified for your trail.

4. Choose the log stream that you want to view.

5. To see the details of the event that your trail logged, choose an
    event.

###### Note

The **Time (UTC)** column in the CloudWatch console
shows when the event was delivered to your log group. To see the actual time
that the event was logged by CloudTrail, see the `eventTime` field.

## Configuring CloudWatch Logs monitoring with the AWS CLI

You can use the AWS CLI to configure CloudTrail to send events to CloudWatch Logs for monitoring.

### Creating a log group

1. If you don't have an existing log group, create a CloudWatch Logs log group as a
    delivery endpoint for log events using the CloudWatch Logs
    `create-log-group` command.

```nohighlight

aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name name
```

The following example creates a log group named
    `CloudTrail/logs`:

```nohighlight

aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name CloudTrail/logs
```

2. Retrieve the log group Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

```nohighlight

aws logs describe-log-groups
```

### Creating a role

Create a role for CloudTrail that enables it to send events to the CloudWatch Logs log group. The
IAM `create-role` command takes two parameters: a role name and a file
path to an assume role policy document in JSON format. The policy document that you
use gives `AssumeRole` permissions to CloudTrail. The `create-role`
command creates the role with the required permissions.

To create the JSON file that will contain the policy document, open a text editor
and save the following policy contents in a file called
`assume_role_policy_document.json`.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

```

Run the following command to create the role with `AssumeRole`
permissions for CloudTrail.

```nohighlight

aws iam create-role --role-name role_name --assume-role-policy-document file://<path to assume_role_policy_document>.json
```

When the command completes, take a note of the role ARN in the output.

### Creating a policy document

Create the following role policy document for CloudTrail. This document grants CloudTrail the
permissions required to create a CloudWatch Logs log stream in the log group you specify and
to deliver CloudTrail events to that log stream.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AWSCloudTrailCreateLogStream2014110",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogStream"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111111111111:log-group:log_group_name:log-stream:111111111111_CloudTrail_us-east-1*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AWSCloudTrailPutLogEvents20141101",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111111111111:log-group:log_group_name:log-stream:111111111111_CloudTrail_us-east-1*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

Save the policy document in a file called
`role-policy-document.json`.

If you're creating a policy that might be used for organization trails as well,
you will need to configure it slightly differently. For example, the following
policy grants CloudTrail the permissions required to create a CloudWatch Logs log stream in the log
group you specify and to deliver CloudTrail events to that log stream for both trails in
the AWS account 111111111111 and for organization trails created in the
111111111111 account that are applied to the AWS Organizations organization with
the ID of `o-exampleorgid`:

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AWSCloudTrailCreateLogStream20141101",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogStream"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:us-east-2:111111111111:log-group:CloudTrail/DefaultLogGroupTest:log-stream:111111111111_CloudTrail_us-east-2*",
                "arn:aws:logs:us-east-2:111111111111:log-group:CloudTrail/DefaultLogGroupTest:log-stream:o-aa111bb222_*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AWSCloudTrailPutLogEvents20141101",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:us-east-2:111111111111:log-group:CloudTrail/DefaultLogGroupTest:log-stream:111111111111_CloudTrail_us-east-2*",
                "arn:aws:logs:us-east-2:111111111111:log-group:CloudTrail/DefaultLogGroupTest:log-stream:o-aa111bb222_*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

For more information about organization trails, see [Creating a trail for an organization](creating-trail-organization.md).

Run the following command to apply the policy to the role.

```nohighlight

aws iam put-role-policy --role-name role_name --policy-name cloudtrail-policy --policy-document file://<path to role-policy-document>.json
```

### Updating the trail

Update the trail with the log group and role information using the CloudTrail
`update-trail` command.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail update-trail --name trail_name --cloud-watch-logs-log-group-arn log_group_arn --cloud-watch-logs-role-arn role_arn
```

For more information about the AWS CLI commands, see the [AWS CloudTrail Command Line\
Reference](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudtrail.md).

## Limitation

CloudWatch Logs and EventBridge each [allow a\
maximum event size of 256 KB](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/cloudwatch-limits-cwl.md). Although most service events have a maximum
size of 256 KB, some services still have events that are larger. CloudTrail does not send
these events to CloudWatch Logs or EventBridge.

Starting with CloudTrail event version 1.05, events have a maximum size of 256 KB. This is
to help prevent exploitation by malicious actors, and allow events to be consumed by
other AWS services, such as CloudWatch Logs and EventBridge.
