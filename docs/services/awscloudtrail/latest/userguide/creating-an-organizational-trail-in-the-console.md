# Creating a trail for your organization in the console

To create an organization trail from the CloudTrail console, you must sign in to the console
as a user or role in the management or delegated administrator account that has [sufficient permissions](creating-an-organizational-trail-prepare.md#org_trail_permissions). If you don't sign in
with the management or delegated administrator account, you won't see the option to
apply a trail to an organization when you create or edit a trail from the CloudTrail
console.

###### To create an organization trail with the AWS Management Console

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail).

    You must be signed in using an IAM identity in the management or delegated
     administrator account with [sufficient\
     permissions](creating-an-organizational-trail-prepare.md#org_trail_permissions) to create an organization trail.

02. Choose **Trails**, and then choose **Create**
    **trail**.

03. On the **Create Trail** page, for **Trail**
    **name**, type a name for your trail. For more information, see [Naming requirements for CloudTrail resources, S3 buckets, and KMS keys](cloudtrail-trail-naming-requirements.md).

04. Select **Enable for all accounts in my organization**. You
     only see this option if you sign in to the console with a user or role in the
     management or delegated administrator account. To successfully create an
     organization trail, be sure that the user or role has [sufficient permissions](creating-an-organizational-trail-prepare.md#org_trail_permissions).

05. For **Storage location**, choose **Create new S3**
    **bucket** to create a bucket. When you create a bucket, CloudTrail creates
     and applies the required bucket policies.

    ###### Note

    If you chose **Use existing S3 bucket**, specify a bucket
    in **Trail log bucket name**, or choose
    **Browse** to choose a bucket. You can choose a bucket
    belonging to any account, however, the bucket policy must grant CloudTrail
    permission to write to it. For information about manually editing the bucket
    policy, see [Amazon S3 bucket policy for CloudTrail](create-s3-bucket-policy-for-cloudtrail.md).

    To make it easier to find your logs, create a new folder (also known as a
     _prefix_) in an existing bucket to store
     your CloudTrail logs. Enter the prefix in **Prefix**.

06. For **Log file SSE-KMS encryption**, choose
     **Enabled** if you want to encrypt your log files and digest files using
     SSE-KMS encryption instead of SSE-S3 encryption. The default is
     **Enabled**. If you don't enable SSE-KMS encryption, your
     log files and digest files are encrypted using SSE-S3 encryption. For more information about SSE-KMS
     encryption, see [Using server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service\
     (SSE-KMS)](../../../s3/latest/userguide/usingkmsencryption.md). For more information about SSE-S3 encryption, see [Using Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed\
     Encryption Keys (SSE-S3)](../../../s3/latest/userguide/usingserversideencryption.md).

    If you enable SSE-KMS encryption, choose a **New** or
     **Existing** AWS KMS key. In **AWS KMS**
    **Alias**, specify an alias, in the format
     `alias/` `MyAliasName`. For more
     information, see [Updating a resource to use your KMS key with the console](create-kms-key-policy-for-cloudtrail-update-trail.md).

    ###### Note

    You can also type the ARN of a key from another account. For more
    information, see [Updating a resource to use your KMS key with the console](create-kms-key-policy-for-cloudtrail-update-trail.md). The
    key policy must allow CloudTrail to use the key to encrypt your log files and digest files, and
    allow the users you specify to read log files or digest files in unencrypted form. For
    information about manually editing the key policy, see [Configure AWS KMS key policies for CloudTrail](create-kms-key-policy-for-cloudtrail.md).

07. In **Additional settings**, configure the following.
    1. For **Log file validation**, choose
        **Enabled** to have log digests delivered to your
        S3 bucket. You can use the digest files to verify that your log files
        did not change after CloudTrail delivered them. For more information, see
        [Validating CloudTrail log file integrity](cloudtrail-log-file-validation-intro.md).

    2. For **SNS notification delivery**, choose
        **Enabled** to be notified each time a log is
        delivered to your bucket. CloudTrail stores multiple events in a log file. SNS
        notifications are sent for every log file, not for every event. For more
        information, see [Configuring Amazon SNS notifications for CloudTrail](configure-sns-notifications-for-cloudtrail.md).

       If you enable SNS notifications, for **Create a new SNS**
       **topic**, choose **New** to create a topic,
        or choose **Existing** to use an existing topic. If you
        are creating multi-Region trail, SNS notifications for log file
        deliveries from all Regions are sent to the single SNS topic that you
        create.

       If you choose **New**, CloudTrail specifies a name for the
        new topic for you, or you can type a name. If you choose
        **Existing**, choose an SNS topic from the
        drop-down list. You can also enter the ARN of a topic from another
        Region or from an account with appropriate permissions. For more
        information, see [Amazon SNS topic policy for CloudTrail](cloudtrail-permissions-for-sns-notifications.md).

       If you create a topic, you must subscribe to the topic to be notified
        of log file delivery. You can subscribe from the Amazon SNS console. Due to
        the frequency of notifications, we recommend that you configure the
        subscription to use an Amazon SQS queue to handle notifications
        programmatically. For more information, see [Getting started with Amazon SNS](../../../sns/latest/dg/sns-getting-started.md) in the _Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide_.
08. Optionally, configure CloudTrail to send log files to CloudWatch Logs by choosing
     **Enabled** in **CloudWatch Logs**. For more
     information, see [Sending events to CloudWatch Logs](send-cloudtrail-events-to-cloudwatch-logs.md).

    ###### Note

    Only the management account can configure a CloudWatch Logs log group for an
    organization trail using the console. The delegated administrator can
    configure a CloudWatch Logs log group using the AWS CLI or CloudTrail `CreateTrail`
    or `UpdateTrail` API operations.

    1. If you enable integration with CloudWatch Logs, choose **New**
        to create a new log group, or **Existing** to use an
        existing one. If you choose **New**, CloudTrail specifies a
        name for the new log group for you, or you can type a name.

    2. If you choose **Existing**, choose a log group from
        the drop-down list.

    3. Choose **New** to create a new IAM role for
        permissions to send logs to CloudWatch Logs. Choose **Existing**
        to choose an existing IAM role from the drop-down list. The policy
        statement for the new or existing role is displayed when you expand
        **Policy document**. For more information about
        this role, see [Role policy document for CloudTrail to use CloudWatch Logs for monitoring](cloudtrail-required-policy-for-cloudwatch-logs.md).

       ###### Note

       When you configure a trail, you can choose an S3 bucket and Amazon SNS
       topic that belong to another account. However, if you want CloudTrail to
       deliver events to a CloudWatch Logs log group, you must choose a log group
       that exists in your current account.
09. For **Tags**, you can add up to 50 tag key pairs to help
     you identify, sort, and control access to your trail. Tags can help you
     identify both your CloudTrail trails and the Amazon S3 buckets that contain CloudTrail log files. You can then use resource groups for your
     CloudTrail resources. For more information, see [AWS Resource Groups](../../../arg/latest/userguide/resource-groups.md) and [Tags](cloudtrail-concepts.md#cloudtrail-concepts-tags).

10. On the **Choose log events** page, choose the event types
     that you want to log. For **Management events**, do the
     following.
    1. For **API activity**, choose if you want your trail
        to log **Read** events, **Write**
        events, or both. For more information, see [Management events](logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.md#logging-management-events).

    2. Choose **Exclude AWS KMS events** to filter AWS Key Management Service
        (AWS KMS) events out of your trail. The default setting is to include all
        AWS KMS events.

       The option to log or exclude AWS KMS events is available only if you log
        management events on your trail. If you choose not to log management
        events, AWS KMS events are not logged, and you cannot change AWS KMS event
        logging settings.

       AWS KMS actions such as `Encrypt`, `Decrypt`, and
        `GenerateDataKey` typically generate a large volume (more
        than 99%) of events. These actions are now logged as
        **Read** events. Low-volume, relevant AWS KMS actions
        such as `Disable`, `Delete`, and
        `ScheduleKey` (which typically account for less than 0.5%
        of AWS KMS event volume) are logged as **Write**
        events.

       To exclude high-volume events like `Encrypt`,
        `Decrypt`, and `GenerateDataKey`, but still
        log relevant events such as `Disable`, `Delete`
        and `ScheduleKey`, choose to log **Write**
        management events, and clear the check box for **Exclude AWS KMS**
       **events**.

    3. Choose **Exclude Amazon RDS Data API events** to filter
        Amazon Relational Database Service Data API events out of your trail. The default setting is to
        include all Amazon RDS Data API events. For more information about Amazon RDS Data
        API events, see [Logging Data API calls with AWS CloudTrail](../../../amazonrds/latest/aurorauserguide/logging-using-cloudtrail-data-api.md) in
        the _Amazon RDS User Guide for Aurora_.
11. To log data events, choose **Data events**. Additional
     charges apply for logging data events. For more information, see [AWS CloudTrail Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing).

12. ###### Important

    Steps 12-16 are for configuring data events using advanced event
    selectors, which is the default. Advanced event selectors let you configure
    more [resource types](logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.md#logging-data-events) and offer
    fine-grained control over which data events your trail captures.
    If you plan to log network activity events, you must use advanced event selectors. If you
    are using basic event selectors, complete the steps in [Configure data event settings using basic event selectors](cloudtrail-create-a-trail-using-the-console-first-time.md#trail-data-events-basic-selectors), then return to step
    17 of this procedure.

    For **Resource type**, choose the resource type on which
     you want to log data events. For more information about available resource types, see [Data events](logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.md#logging-data-events).

13. Choose a log selector template. You can choose a predefined template, or choose **Custom**
     to define your own event collection conditions.

    You can choose from the following predefined
     templates:

- **Log all events** –
Choose this template to log all events.

- **Log only read events** –
Choose this template to log only read events.
Read-only events are events that do not change the
state of a resource, such as `Get*` or `Describe*`
events.

- **Log only write events** – Choose this template to log only write events.
Write events add, change, or delete resources, attributes, or artifacts,
such as `Put*`, `Delete*`, or `Write*` events.

- **Log only AWS Management Console events** –
Choose this template to log only events originating from the AWS Management Console.

- **Exclude AWS service initiated events** – Choose this template to exclude
AWS service events, which have an `eventType` of `AwsServiceEvent`,
and events initiated with AWS service-linked roles (SLRs).

###### Note

Choosing a predefined template for S3 buckets enables data event logging
for all buckets currently in your AWS account and any buckets you create
after you finish creating the trail. It also enables logging of data event
activity performed by any IAM identity in your AWS account, even if that
activity is performed on a bucket that belongs to another AWS
account.

If the trail applies only to one Region, choosing a predefined template
that logs all S3 buckets enables data event logging for all buckets in the
same Region as your trail and any buckets you create later in that Region.
It will not log data events for Amazon S3 buckets in other Regions in your AWS
account.

If you're creating a multi-Region trail, choosing a predefined
template for Lambda functions enables data event logging for all functions
currently in your AWS account, and any Lambda functions you might create in
any Region after you finish creating the trail. If you are creating a trail
for a single Region (done by using the AWS CLI), this selection enables data
event logging for all functions currently in that Region in your AWS
account, and any Lambda functions you might create in that Region after you
finish creating the trail. It does not enable data event logging for Lambda
functions created in other Regions.

Logging data events for all functions also enables logging of data event
activity performed by any IAM identity in your AWS account, even if that
activity is performed on a function that belongs to another AWS
account.

14. (Optional) In **Selector name**, enter a name to identify
     your selector. The selector name is a descriptive name for an advanced event
     selector, such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets". The selector name
     is listed as `Name` in the advanced event selector and is viewable if
     you expand the **JSON view**.

15. If you selected **Custom**, in **Advanced event selectors** build an expression based on the values of advanced event selector fields.

    ###### Note

    Selectors don't support the use of wildcards like `*` . To match multiple values with a single condition,
    you may use `StartsWith`, `EndsWith`, `NotStartsWith`, or `NotEndsWith` to explicitly match the beginning or end of the event field.

    1. Choose from the following fields.

- **`readOnly`**
\- `readOnly` can be set to
**equals** a value of
`true` or `false`. Read-only
data events are events that do not change the state of a
resource, such as `Get*` or
`Describe*` events. Write events add,
change, or delete resources, attributes, or artifacts,
such as `Put*`, `Delete*`, or
`Write*` events. To log both
`read` and `write` events,
don't add a `readOnly` selector.

- **`eventName`** -
`eventName` can use any operator. You can
use it to include or exclude any data event logged to
CloudTrail, such as `PutBucket`,
`GetItem`, or
`GetSnapshotBlock`.

- **`eventSource`** – The event source to include or exclude. This field can use any operator.

- **eventType** – The event type to include or exclude. For example, you can set this field to
**not equals** `AwsServiceEvent` to exclude
[AWS service events](non-api-aws-service-events.md). For a list of event types,
see [eventType](cloudtrail-event-reference-record-contents.md#ct-event-type) in
[CloudTrail record contents for management, data, and network activity events](cloudtrail-event-reference-record-contents.md).

- **sessionCredentialFromConsole** – Include or exclude events originating from an AWS Management Console session. This field can be set to **equals** or **not equals** with a value of
`true`.

- **userIdentity.arn** – Include or exclude events for actions taken by specific IAM identities. For more information, see [CloudTrail userIdentity element](cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.md).

- **`resources.ARN`** \- You can use
any operator with `resources.ARN`, but if you
use **equals** or
**does not equal**, the value must
exactly match the ARN of a valid resource of the type
you've specified in the template as the value of
`resources.type`.

###### Note

You can't use the `resources.ARN` field to filter resource types that do not have ARNs.

For more information about the ARN formats of data event
resources, see [Actions, resources, and condition\
keys for AWS services](../../../service-authorization/latest/reference/reference-policies-actions-resources-contextkeys.md) in the _Service Authorization Reference_.

    2. For each field, choose **\+ Condition** to
        add as many conditions as you need, up to a maximum of 500
        specified values for all conditions. For example, to exclude
        data events for two S3 buckets from data events that are logged
        on your event data store, you can set the field to
        **resources.ARN**, set the operator for
        **does not start with**, and then paste in
        an S3 bucket ARN for which you do
        not want to log events.

       To add the second S3 bucket, choose **+**
       **Condition**, and then repeat the preceding
        instruction, pasting in the ARN for or browsing for a different
        bucket.

       For information about how CloudTrail evaluates multiple conditions, see
        [How CloudTrail evaluates multiple conditions for a field](filtering-data-events.md#filtering-data-events-conditions).

       ###### Note

       You can have a maximum of 500 values for all selectors on
       an event data store. This includes arrays of multiple values for a
       selector such as `eventName`. If you have single
       values for all selectors, you can have a maximum of 500
       conditions added to a selector.

    3. Choose **\+ Field** to add additional fields
        as required. To avoid errors, do not set conflicting or
        duplicate values for fields. For example, do not specify an ARN
        in one selector to be equal to a value, then specify that the
        ARN not equal the same value in another selector.
16. To add resource type on which to log data events, choose **Add**
    **data event type**. Repeat steps 12 through this step to configure
     advanced event selectors for the resource type.

17. To log network activity events, choose **Network activity events**.
     Network activity events enable VPC endpoint owners to record AWS API calls made using their VPC endpoints from a private VPC to the AWS service.
     Additional charges apply for logging data events. For more information, see [AWS CloudTrail Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing).

    To log network activity events, do the following:
    1. From **Network activity event source**, choose the source for network activity events.

    2. In **Log selector template**, choose a template.
        You can choose to log all network activity events, log all network activity access denied events, or choose **Custom** to
        build a custom log selector to filter on multiple fields, such as `eventName` and `vpcEndpointId`.

    3. (Optional) Enter a name to identify the selector. The selector name is listed as **Name** in the advanced event selector and is viewable if you expand the
        **JSON view**.

    4. In **Advanced event**
       **selectors** build expressions by choosing values for **Field**,
        **Operator**, and **Value**. You can skip this step if you are using a predefined log template.
       1. For excluding or including network activity
           events, you can choose from the following fields in the console.

- **`eventName`** – You can use any operator with `eventName`.
You can use it to include or exclude any event, such as `CreateKey`.

- **`errorCode`** – You can use it to filter on an error code. Currently, the only supported `errorCode` is `VpceAccessDenied`.

- **`vpcEndpointId`** – Identifies the VPC endpoint that the operation passed through. You can use
any operator with `vpcEndpointId`.

       2. For each field, choose **\+ Condition** to add as many conditions as you need, up to a maximum of 500 specified values for all conditions.

       3. Choose **\+ Field** to add additional fields as required. To avoid errors, do not set conflicting or duplicate values for fields.
    5. To add another event source for which you want to log network activity events, choose **Add**
       **network activity event selector**.

    6. Optionally, expand **JSON view** to see your
        advanced event selectors as a JSON block.
18. Choose **Insights events** if you want your trail to log
     CloudTrail Insights events.

    In **Event type**, select **Insights**
    **events**. In **Insights events**, choose
     **API call rate**, **API error rate**, or
     both. You must be logging **Write** management events to log
     Insights events for **API call rate**. You must be logging
     **Read** or **Write** management events to
     log Insights events for **API error rate**.

    CloudTrail Insights analyzes management events for unusual activity, and logs events
     when anomalies are detected. By default, trails don't log Insights events. For
     more information about Insights events, see [Working with CloudTrail Insights](logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.md). Additional
     charges apply for logging Insights events. For CloudTrail pricing, see [AWS CloudTrail Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing).

    Insights events are delivered to a different folder named
     `/CloudTrail-Insight` of the same S3 bucket that is specified in
     the **Storage location** area of the trail details page. CloudTrail
     creates the new prefix for you. For example, if your current destination S3
     bucket is named `amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/AWSLogs/CloudTrail/`, the S3 bucket
     name with a new prefix is named
     `amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/AWSLogs/CloudTrail-Insight/`.

19. When you are finished choosing event types to log, choose
     **Next**.

20. On the **Review and create** page, review your choices.
     Choose **Edit** in a section to change the trail settings shown
     in that section. When you are ready to create the trail, choose **Create**
    **trail**.

21. The new trail appears on the **Trails** page. An organization
     trail might take up to 24 hours to be created in all enabled Regions in all member
     accounts. The **Trails** page shows the trails in your account
     from all Regions. In about 5 minutes, CloudTrail publishes log files that show the
     AWS API calls made in your organization. You can see the log files in the Amazon S3
     bucket that you specified.

###### Note

You can't rename a trail after it has been created. Instead, you can delete the
trail and create a new one.

## Next steps

After you create your trail, you can return to the trail to make changes:

- Change the configuration of your trail by editing it. For more
information, see [Updating a trail with the CloudTrail console](cloudtrail-update-a-trail-console.md).

- If needed, configure the Amazon S3 bucket to allow specific users in member
accounts to read the log files for the organization. For more information,
see [Sharing CloudTrail log files between AWS accounts](cloudtrail-sharing-logs.md).

- Configure CloudTrail to send log files to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see [Sending events to CloudWatch Logs](send-cloudtrail-events-to-cloudwatch-logs.md) and [the CloudWatch Logs item](creating-an-organizational-trail-prepare.md#cwl-org-pb) in [Prepare for creating a trail for your organization](creating-an-organizational-trail-prepare.md).

###### Note

Only the management account can configure a CloudWatch Logs log group for an
organization trail.

- Create a table and use it to run a query in Amazon Athena to analyze your
AWS service activity. For more information, see [Creating a Table for CloudTrail Logs in the CloudTrail Console](../../../athena/latest/ug/cloudtrail-logs.md#create-cloudtrail-table-ct)
in the [Amazon Athena User Guide](../../../athena/latest/ug.md).

- Add custom tags (key-value pairs) to the trail.

- To create another organization trail, return to the
**Trails** page and choose **Create**
**trail**.

###### Note

When you configure a trail, you can choose an Amazon S3 bucket and SNS topic that
belong to another account. However, if you want CloudTrail to deliver events to a
CloudWatch Logs log group, you must choose a log group that exists in your current
account.
