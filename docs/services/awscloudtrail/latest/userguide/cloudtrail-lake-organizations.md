# Understanding organization event data stores

###### Note

AWS CloudTrail Lake will no longer be open to new customers starting May 31, 2026.
If you would like to use CloudTrail Lake, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[CloudTrail Lake availability change](cloudtrail-lake-service-availability-change.md).

If you have created an organization in AWS Organizations, you can create an _organization_
_event data store_ that logs all events for all AWS accounts in that
organization. Organization event data stores can apply to all AWS Regions, or the current
Region. You can't use an organization event data store to collect events from outside of
AWS.

You can [create an organization\
event data store](#cloudtrail-lake-organizations-create-eds) by using either the management account or the delegated
administrator account. When a delegated administrator creates an organization event data
store, the organization event data store exists in the management account for the
organization. This approach is because the management account maintains ownership of all
organization resources.

The management account for an organization can [update an account-level event data\
store](#cloudtrail-lake-organizations-update-eds) to apply it to an organization.

When the organization event data store is specified as applying to an organization, it's
automatically applied to all member accounts in the organization. Member accounts can't see
the organization event data store, nor can they modify or delete it. By default, member
accounts don't have access to the organization event data store, nor can they run queries on
organization event data stores.

The following table shows the capabilities of the management account and delegated
administrator accounts within the AWS Organizations organization.

1Only the management account can convert an organization event
data store to an account-level event data store, or convert an account-level event data
store to an organization event data store. These actions are not allowed for the delegated
administrator because organization event data stores only exist in the management account.
When an organization event data store is converted to an account-level event data store,
only the management account has access to the event data store. Likewise, only an
account-level event data store in the management account can be converted to an
organization event data store.

2Only a single delegated administrator account or the
management account can enable federation on an organization event data store. Other delegated
administrator accounts can query and share information using the [Lake Formation data sharing\
feature](../../../lake-formation/latest/dg/data-sharing-overivew.md). Any delegated administrator account as well as the organization's
management account can disable federation.

## Create an organization event data store

The management account or delegated administrator account for an organization can
create an organization event data store to collect either CloudTrail events (management
events, data events) or AWS Config configuration items.

###### Note

Only the organization's management account can copy trail events to an
event data store.

CloudTrail console

###### To create an organization event data store using the console

1. Follow the steps in the [create an\
    event data store for CloudTrail events](query-event-data-store-cloudtrail.md#query-event-data-store-cloudtrail-procedure) procedure to create an
    organization event data store for CloudTrail management or data
    events.

**OR**

Follow the steps in the [create an event data store for AWS Config configuration items](query-event-data-store-config.md#create-config-event-data-store)
    procedure to create an organization event data store for AWS Config
    configuration items.

2. On the **Choose events** page, choose
    **Enable for all accounts in my**
**organization**.

AWS CLI

To create an organization event data store run the [create-event-data-store](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudtrail/create-event-data-store.md) command and include
the `--organization-enabled` option.

The following example AWS CLI `create-event-data-store` command
creates an organization event data store that collects all management
events. Because CloudTrail logs management events by default, you don't need to
specify advanced event selectors if your event data store is logging all
management events and is not collecting any data events.

```JSON

aws cloudtrail create-event-data-store --name org-management-eds --organization-enabled
```

The following is an example response.

```JSON

{
    "EventDataStoreArn": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:123456789012:eventdatastore/EXAMPLE6-d493-4914-9182-e52a7934b207",
    "Name": "org-management-eds",
    "Status": "CREATED",
    "AdvancedEventSelectors": [
        {
            "Name": "Default management events",
            "FieldSelectors": [
                {
                    "Field": "eventCategory",
                    "Equals": [
                        "Management"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "MultiRegionEnabled": true,
    "OrganizationEnabled": true,
    "BillingMode": "EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING",
    "RetentionPeriod": 366,
    "TerminationProtectionEnabled": true,
    "CreatedTimestamp": "2023-11-16T15:30:50.689000+00:00",
    "UpdatedTimestamp": "2023-11-16T15:30:50.851000+00:00"
}
```

The next example AWS CLI `create-event-data-store` command
creates an organization event data store named
`config-items-org-eds` that collects AWS Config configuration
items. To collect configuration items, specify that the
`eventCategory` field equals `ConfigurationItem`
in the advanced event selectors.

```JSON

aws cloudtrail create-event-data-store --name config-items-org-eds \
--organization-enabled \
--advanced-event-selectors '[
    {
        "Name": "Select AWS Config configuration items",
        "FieldSelectors": [
            { "Field": "eventCategory", "Equals": ["ConfigurationItem"] }
        ]
    }
]'
```

## Apply an account-level event data store to an organization

The organization's management account can convert an account-level event data store to
apply it to an organization.

CloudTrail console

###### To update an account-level event data store using the console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail).

2. In the navigation pane, under **Lake**, choose
    **Event data stores**.

3. Choose the event data store that you want to update. This action
    opens the event data store's details page.

4. In **General details**, choose
    **Edit**.

5. Choose **Enable for all accounts in my**
**organization**.

6. Choose **Save changes**.

For additional information about updating an event data store, see [Update an event data store with the console](query-event-data-store-update.md).

AWS CLI

To update an account-level event data store to apply it to an
organization, run the [update-event-data-store](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudtrail/update-event-data-store.md) command and include the
`--organization-enabled` option.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail update-event-data-store --region us-east-1 \
--organization-enabled \
--event-data-store arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:123456789012:eventdatastore/EXAMPLE-f852-4e8f-8bd1-bcf6cEXAMPLE
```

## Default resource policy for delegated administrators

CloudTrail automatically generates a resource policy named
`DelegatedAdminResourcePolicy` for [organization event data stores](cloudtrail-lake-organizations.md) that
lists the actions that the delegated administrator accounts are allowed to perform on
organization event data stores. The permissions in
`DelegatedAdminResourcePolicy` are derived from the delegated
administrator permissions in AWS Organizations.

The purpose of `DelegatedAdminResourcePolicy` is to ensure that the
delegated administrator accounts can manage the organization event data store on the
behalf of the organization and are not unintentionally denied access to the organization
event data store when a resource-based policy is attached to the organization event data
store that allows or denies principals from performing an action on the organization event data store.

CloudTrail evaluates `DelegatedAdminResourcePolicy` in tandem with any
resource-based policy provided for the organization event data store. The delegated
administrator accounts would only be denied access if the provided resource-based policy
included a statement that explicitly denied the delegated administrator accounts from
performing an action on the organization event data store that the delegated
administrator accounts would otherwise be able to perform.

This `DelegatedAdminResourcePolicy` policy is updated automatically when:

- The management account converts an organization event data store to an
account-level event data store, or converts an account-level event data store to
an organization event data store.

- There are organization changes. For example, the management account registers or removes a CloudTrail delegated administrator account.

You can view the up-to-date policy on the **Delegated administrator resource policy**
section on the CloudTrail console, or by running the AWS CLI `get-resource-policy` command
and passing the ARN of the organization event data store.

The following example runs the `get-resource-policy` command on an organization event data store.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail get-resource-policy --resource-arn arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:888888888888:eventdatastore/example6-d493-4914-9182-e52a7934b207
```

The output of this command will show the resource-based policy and the `DelegatedAdminResourcePolicy` policy generated
for the delegated administrator accounts.
