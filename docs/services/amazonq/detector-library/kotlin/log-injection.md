# Log injection [High](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/detector-library/kotlin/severity/high)

User-provided inputs must be sanitized before they are logged. An attacker can use unsanitized input to break a log's integrity, forge log entries, or bypass log monitors.

#### Noncompliant example

```kotlin
1// Noncompliant: Unsanitized user data is being written to the logs
2fun noncompliant(request: ServletRequest) {
3    val xValue = request.getParameter("x")
4    logger.info("Value is: {}", xValue)
5}

```

#### Compliant example

```kotlin
1// Compliant: There is no user input being written to the logs.
2fun compliant(input: String) {
3    logger.info("Value is: {}", input)
4}

```
