# Bitwise Operator On Signed Operand [High](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/detector-library/c/severity/high)

Using bitwise operators with signed numbers can lead to unexpected results. It's safer to use them with unsigned numbers.

#### Noncompliant example

```c
1#include <stdio.h>
2
3int bitwiseOperatoronSignedOperandNonCompliant(int i) {
4    // Noncompliant: Bitwise operator applied on signed operand.
5    return 1 << i; // Noncompliant
6}

```

#### Compliant example

```c
1#include <stdio.h>
2
3int bitwiseOperatoronSignedOperandCompliant(unsigned int i) {
4    // Compliant: Bitwise operator applied on unsigned operand.
5    return 1 << i;
6}

```
