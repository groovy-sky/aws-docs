# Incorrect Use Of Free [Critical](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/detector-library/c/severity/critical)

We observed that memory use after free condition leads to memory corruption and undefined behavior. It can cause crashes at best, or allow attackers to violate memory safety and exploit the code at worst.

#### Noncompliant example

```c
1#include <stdio.h>
2#include <stdlib.h>
3#include <string.h>
4
5int incorrectUseOfFreeNonCompliant() {
6    NAME *var;
7    char buf[10];
8    var = (NAME *)malloc(sizeof(struct name));
9    free(var);
10    // Noncompliant: Variable is used after free
11    strcpy(buf, (char*)var);
12    return 0;
13}

```

#### Compliant example

```c
1#include <stdio.h>
2#include <stdlib.h>
3#include <string.h>
4
5int incorrectUseOfFreeCompliant() {
6    NAME *var;
7    char buf[10];
8    var = (NAME *)malloc(sizeof(struct name));
9    free(var);
10    var = (NAME *)malloc(sizeof(struct name));
11    // Compliant: Variable is used after memory reallocation
12    var->func(var->myname);
13    return 0;
14}
