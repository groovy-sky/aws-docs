# Incorrect Format Specifier [High](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/detector-library/c/severity/high)

We observed missing or incorrect format specifier being passed to formatted I/O function. Using incorrect formats or allowing attackers to control the format specifier enables exploitation through formatted I/O functions and can also lead to buffer overflows, denial of service, or data representation problems.
