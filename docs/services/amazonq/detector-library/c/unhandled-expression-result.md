# Unhandled Expression Result [High](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/detector-library/c/severity/high)

Non empty statements such as 'a + b' lacking clear context can lead to confusion in the codebase. To address this, it's advisable to integrate such statements into larger constructs that contribute meaningfully to the program's logic, potentially by assigning their result to a variable or incorporating them into relevant operations.

#### Noncompliant example

```c
1#include <stdio.h>
2
3int unhandledExpressionResultNonCompliant(int a, int b) {
4    int result = 0;
5    // Noncompliant: Unnecessary operation, expression result is not handled by any variable here
6    a + b;
7    return result;
8}

```

#### Compliant example

```c
1#include <stdio.h>
2
3int unhandledExpressionResultCompliant(int a, int b) {
4    int result = 0;
5    // Compliant: Expression result is handled by variable
6    result = a + b;
7    return result;
8}

```
