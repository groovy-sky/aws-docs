# Write Pprof Profile Output [High](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/detector-library/go/severity/high)

The system has deteted instances where stack traces are either printed or included in HTTP responses. Such occurrences could lead to the exposure of sensitive information if the application is deployed in a user-facing manner within a production environment. It is crucial to address this issue to prevent unintentional disclosure of sensitive data and enhance the overall security of the application.
