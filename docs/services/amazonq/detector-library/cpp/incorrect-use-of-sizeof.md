# Incorrect Use of Sizeof [Critical](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/detector-library/cpp/severity/critical)

Sizeof on a malloced pointer type returns the wordsize/8. It can sometimes produce useful information if you determine allocated memory intentionally.

#### Noncompliant example

```cpp
1#include <stdlib.h>
2
3void incorrectUseOfSizeofNoncompliant()
4{
5	double *foo;
6
7	// Noncompliant: Used `sizeof(foo)` on a malloced pointer type.
8	foo = (double *)malloc(sizeof(foo));
9}

```

#### Compliant example

```cpp
1#include <stdlib.h>
2
3void incorrectUseOfSizeofCompliant()
4{
5	double *foo;
6
7	// Compliant: Used `sizeof(*foo)`.
8	foo = (double *)malloc(sizeof(*foo));
9}

```
