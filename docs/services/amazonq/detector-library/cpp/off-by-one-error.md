# off by one error [High](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/detector-library/cpp/severity/high)

Off-by-one errors are programming mistakes where loops or array indices are improperly incremented or decremented by one, resulting in unintended behavior. These errors often lead to out-of-bounds memory access, incorrect data processing, or program crashes. Mitigation involves ensuring correct loop boundaries, validating indices, and implementing thorough boundary checks to prevent such issues.

#### Noncompliant example

```cpp
1#include <stdio.h>
2
3void offByOneErrorNoncompliant() {
4    int id_sequence[3];
5
6    id_sequence[0] = 123;
7    id_sequence[1] = 234;
8    id_sequence[2] = 345;
9    // Noncompliant: Attempting to access index 3 out of bound
10    id_sequence[3] = 456;
11}

```

#### Compliant example

```cpp
1#include <stdio.h>
2
3void offByOneErrorCompliant() {
4
5    int id_sequence[4]; // Increase array size to accommodate the additional element
6
7    id_sequence[0] = 123;
8    id_sequence[1] = 234;
9    id_sequence[2] = 345;
10    // Compliant: This is a valid index within the bounds of the array.
11    id_sequence[3] = 456;
12}

```
