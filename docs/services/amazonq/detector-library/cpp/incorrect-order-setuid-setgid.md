# Incorrect Order Of setuid and setgid [Critical](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/detector-library/cpp/severity/critical)

A compromised process might be able to regain elevated group privileges if set(e)gid() is called after set(e)uid(). A similar case is when privileges are temporarily dropped with seteuid() and then setuid() or seteuid() are called from while under unprivileged user.

#### Noncompliant example

```cpp
1#include <unistd.h>
2
3void incorrectOrderSetuidSetgidNoncompliant()
4{
5    // Noncompliant: `setgid()` is called after `setuid()`.
6    setuid(getuid());
7    setgid(getgid());
8}

```

#### Compliant example

```cpp
1#include <unistd.h>
2
3void incorrectOrderSetuidSetgidCompliant()
4{
5    // Compliant: `setgid()` is called before `setuid()`
6    setgid(getgid());
7    setuid(getuid());
8}

```
