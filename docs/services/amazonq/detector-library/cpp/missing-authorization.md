# Missing Authorization [High](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/detector-library/cpp/severity/high)

When access control checks are not applied, users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to access or perform. The lack of access control checks can cause the exposure of information, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution. We recommend that you apply access control checks to all access points.

#### Noncompliant example

```cpp
1#include <stdio.h>
2
3void missingAuthorizationNoncompliant() {
4    // Noncompliant: Deletes a file if the user is an admin without checking specific permission.
5    if (user.isAdmin())
6    {
7        deleteFile("important_document.txt");
8    }
9}

```

#### Compliant example

```cpp
1#include <stdio.h>
2
3void missingAuthorizationCompliant() {
4    // Compliant: Checks for a specific permission (DELETE_FILE) before deleting the file.
5    if (user.hasPermission(DELETE_FILE))
6    {
7        deleteFile("important_document.txt");
8    }
9}

```
