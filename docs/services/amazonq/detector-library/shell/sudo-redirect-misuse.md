#### Noncompliant example

```bash
1
2# Noncompliant: `sudo` doesn't affect redirections, so this fails to write.
3sudo echo "New setting" > /etc/myapp/settings.conf
```

#### Compliant example

```bash
1
2# Compliant: Uses `tee` to write with `sudo` privileges.
3echo "New setting" | sudo tee /etc/myapp/settings.conf > /dev/null
