# Use of if and then [Medium](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/detector-library/shell/severity/medium)

The task is to verify the success or failure of a command within a shell script using conditional statements. The solution requires understanding how to use 'if cmd; then' to assess the exit code of a command to evaluate its output, ensuring proper error handling and flow control in shell scripting contexts.

#### Noncompliant example

```bash
1
2# Noncompliant: Incorrectly uses test brackets around a command.
3if [ ls -l /etc/passwd ]
4then
5    echo "Successfully listed /etc/passwd"
6else
7    echo "Failed to list /etc/passwd"
8fi
```

#### Compliant example

```bash
1
2# Compliant: Directly uses the command in the `if` statement.
3if ls -l /etc/passwd
4then
5    echo "Successfully listed /etc/passwd"
6else
7    echo "Failed to list /etc/passwd"
8fi
```
