# Single-Iteration Loop [Medium](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/detector-library/shell/severity/medium)

Using a constant value in a for loop results in only one iteration, which is likely unintended and ineffective. To fix this, use appropriate syntax to iterate over multiple values, such as '$var' for variable contents, or '$(cmd)' for command output.

#### Noncompliant example

```bash
1
2# Noncompliant: This loop will only run once.
3for file in myfile.txt
4do
5    echo "Processing $file"
6done
```

#### Compliant example

```bash
1
2# Compliant: Correct usage of for loop to iterate over files.
3for file in *.txt
4do
5    echo "Processing $file"
6done
```
