# Prefer Find Over LS [Medium](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/detector-library/shell/severity/medium)

The 'ls' command is primarily intended for human-readable output and can be unreliable when used for scripting. For file operations, use 'find' which offers more flexibility, accuracy, and control over handling files with special characters or long filenames.

#### Noncompliant example

```bash
1
2# Noncompliant: ls output can be inconsistent and break with special characters
3ls -l | grep 'somefile*' | grep '\.log$'
4NUMFILES=$(ls *.txt | wc -l)

```

#### Compliant example

```bash
1
2# Compliant: find handles special characters and provides consistent output
3find . -type f -name '*.log' -exec ls -l {} + | grep 'somefile*'
4numfiles=$(find . -type f -name '*.txt' | wc -l)
```
