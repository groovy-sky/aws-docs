# Log Injection [High](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/detector-library/ruby/severity/high)

User input has access to log output, which allows manipulation of logged data. This may allow for malicious users to log false information.

#### Noncompliant example

```ruby
1  def log_params_noncompliant
2    init_logger
3
4    unsanitized = params[:foo]
5    # Noncompliant: Unsanitized user-input is used in logger
6    @logger.error "input: " + unsanitized
7  end
```

#### Compliant example

```ruby
1  def log_params_compliant
2    init_logger
3
4    unsanitized = params[:foo]
5
6    sanitized = unsanitized.gsub("\n", "")
7    # Compliant: Sanitized user-input is used in logger
8    @logger.warn "input: " + sanitized
9  end
```
