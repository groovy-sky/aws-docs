# Upgrading Java versions with Amazon Q Developer

Amazon Q Developer can upgrade your Java applications to newer language versions in
the integrated development environment (IDE). Changes Amazon Q can make to upgrade your code
include updating deprecated code components and APIs as well as upgrading libraries,
frameworks, and other dependencies in your code.

To transform your code, Amazon Q first builds your code in the source language version and
verifies that it has the information necessary to perform the transformation. After Amazon Q
successfully transforms your code, you verify and accept the changes in your IDE. Since
Amazon Q Developer makes the minimal changes necessary to make your upgraded code compatible with
the target JDK, an additional transformation is required to upgrade your project's
libraries and dependencies. For more information about how Amazon Q transforms your code,
see [How Amazon Q Developer transforms code for Java language upgrades](how-ct-works.md).

## Supported Java upgrades and IDEs

Amazon Q currently supports the following Java source code versions and target versions
for transformations. Transforming code to the same Java version includes upgrading
libraries and other dependencies in the source code version.

Java 21

Amazon Q supports Java upgrades in the following IDEs:

- Modules in JetBrains IDEs

- Projects and workspaces in Visual Studio Code

## Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you continue, make sure you’ve completed the steps in [Set up Amazon Q in your IDE](q-in-ide-setup.md).

Make sure that the following prerequisites are met before you begin a Code
Transformation job:

- Your project is written in a [supported\
Java version](#supported-languages-IDEs) and is built on Maven.

- Your project successfully builds with Maven in your IDE. Maven 3.8 or later is currently supported.

- Your project source JDK is available locally and is the version of your source
code. For example, if you are transforming Java 8 code, your local JDK installation should be
JDK 8.

- Your project builds in 55 minutes or less.

- Your project is configured correctly, and the correct JDK version is specified.
For more information, see [Step 2: Configure your project](#configure-project).

- Your project doesn't require access to resources on your private network,
including a virtual private cloud (VPC) or on-premise network. For example, if your
project contains unit tests that connect to a database in your network, the
transformation will fail.

- Your project doesn't use plugins that package languages other than Java in your Java
project. For example, if your project uses the
[frontend-maven-plugin](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin) for executing
front-end JavaScript code in addition to your Java source code, the transformation will fail.

- Your local network allows uploads to Amazon S3 buckets that Amazon Q uses to transform
your code. For more information, see [Allow access to Amazon S3 buckets in data perimeters](firewall.md#data-perimeters).

- Your application only uses UTF-8 characters. If your application uses non-UTF-8
characters, Amazon Q will still attempt to transform your code.

## Step 2: Configure your project

To configure your project, use the following information for the IDE you're
using.

### Configure a project in JetBrains

To configure your project in JetBrains, you might need to specify the following project and module settings.

If your modules use the same JDK and language level as your project, you don't need
to update module settings.

- Project SDK – The JDK used to compile your project.

- Project language level – The Java version used in your project.

- Module SDK – The JDK used to compile your module.

- Module language level – The Java version used in your module.

- Maven Runner JRE – The JDK you build your module with.

###### Update project and module settings

To update your SDK and language level settings for your project or module, complete
the following steps:

1. From your JetBrains IDE, choose **File** and then **Project Structure**.

2. The Project Structure window opens. Under **Project Settings**,
    choose **Project**.
1. To update your project JDK, choose from the dropdown list next to **SDK**.

2. To update your project language, choose from the dropdown next to **Language level**.
3. Under **Project Settings**, choose
    **Modules**.
1. To update your module JDK, choose from the dropdown list next to **SDK**.

2. To update your module language, choose from the
       dropdown next to **Language level**.

For more information, see
[Project structure settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/project-settings-and-structure.html) and
[Module structure\
settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configure-modules.html) in the JetBrains documentation.

###### Update Maven settings

To update your Maven Runner JRE, complete the following steps:

1. From your JetBrains IDE, choose the gear icon, and then choose **Settings** in the menu that appears.

2. In the **Settings** window, choose **Build, Execution, Deployment**, then
    **Build Tools**, then **Maven**, and then **Runner**.

3. In the JRE field, choose the JDK used to build the module you're transforming.

### Configure a project in VS Code

To configure your project in VS Code, your project must
contain the following:

- A `pom.xml` file in the project root folder

- A `.java` file in the project directory

If your project contains a Maven wrapper executable ( `mvnw` for
macOS or `mvnw.cmd` for Windows), make sure
it’s at the root of your project. Amazon Q will use the wrapper, and no other Maven
configuration is necessary.

If you aren’t using a Maven wrapper, install Maven. For more information, see
[Installing Apache\
Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) in the Apache Maven documentation.

After installing Maven, add it to your `PATH` variable. For more
information, see [How do I add Maven to my PATH?](troubleshooting-code-transformation.md#add-maven-to-path)
Your Java `runtime` variable should also be pointing to a JDK and not to a
JRE. To confirm your configuration is correct, run `mvn -v`. The output
should show your Maven version and the `runtime` variable pointing to the
path to your JDK.

## Step 3: Create a dependency upgrade file (optional)

You can provide Amazon Q with a _dependency upgrade file_, a YAML
file that lists your project's dependencies and which versions to upgrade to during
a transformation. By providing a dependency upgrade file, you can specify third and
first party dependencies that Amazon Q might not otherwise know to upgrade.

First party dependencies refer to the libraries, plugins, and frameworks that your
organization maintains and are only available locally or on your organization’s
private network. Amazon Q is able to access your first party dependencies when it
performs builds in your local environment. For more information, see [Building code in your local environment](how-ct-works.md#java-local-builds). Third party dependencies are publicly available
or open source dependencies that aren’t unique to your organization.

You can specify first party dependencies you want to upgrade in a YAML file, and Amazon Q
upgrades them during the JDK upgrade (for example, Java 8 to 17). You can initiate a
separate transformation (17 to 17 or 21 to 21) after the initial JDK upgrade to upgrade
third-party dependencies.

Once Amazon Q performs a minimum JDK upgrade, you can initiate a separate transformation
to upgrade all third party dependencies. Alternatively, you can specify third party
dependencies and their versions in a YAML file to only upgrade those dependencies during
the library upgrade transformation.

Amazon Q will prompt you to provide a dependency upgrade file during the
transformation. If you want to provide one, first make sure you've configured the
file properly. The following fields are required in the YAML file:

- name - The name of the dependency upgrade file.

- description (optional) - A description of the dependency upgrade file, and for which transformation.

- dependencyManagement - Contains the list of dependencies and plugins to upgrade.

- dependencies - Contains the name and version of the libraries to upgrade.

- plugins - Contains the names and versions of the plugins to upgrade.

- identifier - The name of the library, plugin, or other dependency.

- targetVersion - The version of the dependency to upgrade to.

- versionProperty (optional) - The version of the dependency you're
defining, as set with the `properties` tag in your application's `pom.xml`
file.

- originType - Whether the dependency is first or third party, specified by either FIRST\_PARTY or THIRD\_PARTY.

Following is an example of a dependency upgrade YAML file, and the required configuration for Amazon Q to parse:

```

name: dependency-upgrade

description: "Custom dependency version management for Java migration from JDK 8/11/17 to JDK 17/21"

dependencyManagement:

  dependencies:

    - identifier: "com.example:library1"

      targetVersion: "2.1.0"

      versionProperty: "library1.version"  # Optional

      originType: "FIRST_PARTY"

    - identifier: "com.example:library2"

      targetVersion: "3.0.0"

      originType: "THIRD_PARTY"

  plugins:

    - identifier: "com.example.plugin"

      targetVersion: "1.2.0"

      versionProperty: "plugin.version"  # Optional

      originType: "THIRD_PARTY"
```

## Step 4: Transform your code

To test your IDE setup, download and unzip the sample
project, and complete the following steps for your IDE. If you are able to view the
proposed changes and transformation summary, you are ready to transform your own code
project. If the transformation fails, your IDE is not configured correctly. To address
configuration issues, review [Step 2: Configure your project](#configure-project) and [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting-code-transformation.md).

###### Note

Do not turn off, close, or put your local machine to sleep during the code
transformation. The initial and validation builds use the client-side environment, which
requires a stable network connection.

To upgrade the language version of your code project or module, complete the following
steps for your IDE.

JetBrains

1. Open the module that you want to upgrade in JetBrains. Make sure you’ve
    successfully built your project in the IDE.

2. Choose the Amazon Q logo, and ask Amazon Q to transform your application
    in the chat panel that opens.

3. A **Transform your application** pop-up appears. Choose
    the project that you want to upgrade from the dropdown list, and then choose
    **Transform**.

4. Amazon Q prompts you to provide an upgrade dependency file. If you have
    configured a YAML with the dependencies and version to upgrade to, add your
    file. Amazon Q will validate the file to ensure it's configured correctly. If
    you get an error, review the format and required fields described in [Step 3: Create a dependency upgrade file (optional)](#create-dependency-upgrade-file).

5. Amazon Q begins the transformation. You can view progress on the
    **Transformation details** tab.

6. After the transformation is complete, you can verify the upgraded code
    before updating your project. To view the new code, go to the
    **Transformation details** tab and then choose
    **View diff**. In the **Apply patch**
    window that appears, choose a file to open a diff view with your source code
    and upgraded code.

7. To accept the changes that Amazon Q made, choose **View**
**diff** to open the **Apply patch** window.
    Select all the updated files, and choose **OK** to update
    your project in place.

8. To get details about how your code was upgraded and suggested next steps,
    on the **Transformation details** tab, choose
    **View transformation summary**.

Visual Studio Code

01. Open the project or workspace that you want to upgrade in VS Code.
     Make sure that you’ve successfully built your project in the IDE.

02. Choose the Amazon Q logo, and ask Amazon Q to transform your application in the chat panel that
     opens.

03. Choose the project that you want to upgrade from the search bar at the
     top of the IDE.

04. If Amazon Q can’t find the version of your source code, it prompts you to
     choose your code version. Choose the version that your source code is
     written in, and then choose **Transform** in the pop-up to
     proceed.

05. If prompted, enter the `JAVA_HOME` path to your JDK. For more
     information, see [Configure your VS Code project](#configure-vsc).

06. Amazon Q prompts you to provide an upgrade dependency file. If you have
     configured a YAML with the dependencies and version to upgrade to, add your
     file. Amazon Q will validate the file to ensure it's configured correctly. If
     you get an error, review the format and required fields described in [Step 3: Create a dependency upgrade file (optional)](#create-dependency-upgrade-file).

07. Amazon Q begins the transformation. You can view progress on the
     **Transformation Hub** tab.

08. After the transformation is complete, the **Proposed**
    **Changes** tab opens. To verify the upgraded code before updating
     your project, choose **Download proposed changes**. Choose
     a file to open a diff view with your source code and upgraded code.

09. To accept the changes Amazon Q made, go to the **Proposed**
    **Changes** tab and choose **Accept**.

10. To get details about how your code was upgraded and suggested next steps,
     on the **Transformation Hub**, choose the **Views**
    **and More Actions** ellipsis button, and then choose
     **Show Transformation Summary**.
