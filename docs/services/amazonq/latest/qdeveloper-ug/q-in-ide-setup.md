# Installing the Amazon Q Developer extension or plugin in your IDE

To set up Amazon Q Developer in your integrated development environment (IDE), complete the following steps.
After installing the Amazon Q extension or plugin, authenticate through IAM Identity Center or AWS Builder ID. You can use
Amazon Q for free, without an AWS account, by authenticating with Builder ID.

To get started, download the Amazon Q extension or plugin for your IDE:

- [Download Amazon Q for Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/amazon-q)

- [Download Amazon Q for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.amazon-q-vscode)

- [Download Amazon Q for JetBrains\
IDEs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24267-amazon-q)

- [Download Amazon Q in the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.AWSToolkitforVisualStudio2022)

###### Note

In general, the default duration for a session that is authenticated through IAM Identity Center is 8 hours.
However, in the case of Amazon Q, the default session lasts 90 days (if you set up IAM Identity Center on April 18,
2024 or later). For more information refer to [How to extend the session duration for Amazon Q in the IDE](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/configure-user-session.html#90-day-extended-session-duration) in the
_AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_

To sign in and authenticate, complete the steps in this section.

## Using an IAM principal in your AWS console

Depending on how you use AWS, you may be accustomed to using your IAM credentials to sign in
to the console for all AWS services. However, you cannot use Amazon Q Developer in the IDE as an IAM
principal, or with an IAM role. You must authenticate with credentials from either IAM Identity Center or
Builder ID.
