# AWS managed policies for Amazon Q Developer

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS
managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start
assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles.

The quickest way for an administrator to grant access to users is through an AWS managed policy.
The following AWS managed policies for Amazon Q Developer can be attached to IAM identities:

- `AmazonQFullAccess` provides full access to enable interactions with Amazon Q Developer,
including administrator access.

- `AmazonQDeveloperAccess` provides full access to enable interactions with
Amazon Q Developer, without administrator access.

###### Note

Users accessing Amazon Q in the IDE or on the command line don't require
IAM permissions.

Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your
specific use cases because they’re available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you
reduce permissions further by defining [customer managed policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md#customer-managed-policies) that are specific to your use cases.

You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the
permissions defined in an AWS managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users,
groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is most likely to update an AWS managed
policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for existing
services.

For more information, see [AWS\
managed policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md#aws-managed-policies) in the _IAM User Guide_.
