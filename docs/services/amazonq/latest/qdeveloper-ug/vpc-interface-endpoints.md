# Amazon Q Developer and interface endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)

###### Note

Amazon Q Developer supports interface endpoints for features available [in\
your IDE](q-in-ide.md). Chatting with Amazon Q [on AWS apps and\
websites](q-on-aws.md) is not supported for VPC endpoints. Neither is the Amazon Q Developer transformation web experience.

You can establish a private connection between your VPC and Amazon Q Developer by creating an
_interface VPC endpoint_. Interface endpoints are powered by [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink), a technology that enables you
to privately access Amazon Q APIs without an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or
AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC don't need public IP addresses to
communicate with Amazon Q APIs. Traffic between your VPC and Amazon Q does not leave the Amazon
network.

Each interface endpoint is represented by one or more [Elastic Network Interfaces](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-eni.md) in your
subnets.

For more information, see [Interface VPC\
endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html) in the _Amazon VPC User_
_Guide_.

## Considerations for Amazon Q VPC endpoints

Before you set up an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon Q, ensure that you review [Interface\
endpoint properties and limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#vpce-interface-limitations) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

Amazon Q supports making calls to all of its API actions from your VPC, in the context
of services that are configured to work with Amazon Q.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin any of the procedures below, ensure that you have the
following:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and configure
resources.

- A VPC already created in your AWS account.

- Familiarity with AWS services, especially Amazon VPC and Amazon Q.

## Creating an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon Q

You can create a VPC endpoint for the Amazon Q service using either the Amazon VPC console or the
AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For more information, see [Creating an interface\
endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

Create the following VPC endpoints for Amazon Q using the following service names:

- com.amazonaws. `region`.q

- com.amazonaws.us-east-1.codewhisperer

Replace `region` with AWS Region where your Amazon Q Developer profile is
installed. For more information, see [Supported Regions for the Q Developer console and Q Developer profile](q-admin-setup-subscribe-regions.md#qdev-console-and-profile-regions).

###### Note

The Amazon CodeWhisperer endpoint (com.amazonaws.us-east-1.codewhisperer) is only supported in
the US East (N. Virginia) Region.

If you enable private DNS for the endpoint, you can make API requests to Amazon Q using its
default DNS name for the Region, for example, `q.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.

For more information, see [Accessing a\
service through an interface endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#access-service-though-endpoint) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.

## Using an on-premises computer to connect to a Amazon Q endpoint

This section describes the process of using an on-premises computer to connect to
Amazon Q through a AWS PrivateLink endpoint in your AWS VPC.

1. [Create a VPN\
    connection between your on-premises device and your VPC.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-user/client-vpn-user-what-is.html)

2. [Create an interface VPC endpoint for\
    Amazon Q.](#vpc-endpoint-create)

3. [Set up an inbound Amazon Route 53 endpoint.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-vpc-interface-endpoint.html) This will enable you to use
    the DNS name of your Amazon Q endpoint from your on-premises device.

## Using an in-console coding environment to connect to a Amazon Q endpoint

This section describes the process of using an in-console coding environment to
connect to a Amazon Q endpoint.

In this context, an in-console IDE is an IDE that you access inside the AWS console,
and authenticate to with IAM. Examples include SageMaker AI Studio and AWS Glue
Studio.

1. [Create an interface VPC endpoint for\
    Amazon Q.](#vpc-endpoint-create)

2. Set up Amazon Q with the in-console coding environment

- [SageMaker AI Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/sagemaker-setup.html)

- [AWS Glue Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/glue-setup.html)

3. Configure the coding environment to use the Amazon Q endpoint.

- [SageMaker AI Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/host-vpc.html)

- [AWS Glue Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/start-connecting.html)

## Connecting to Amazon Q through AWS PrivateLink from a third-Party IDE on an Amazon EC2 instance

This section will walk you through the process of installing a third-party Integrated
Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code or JetBrains on an Amazon EC2 instance,
and configuring it to connect to Amazon Q using AWS PrivateLink.

1. [Create an interface VPC endpoint for\
    Amazon Q.](#vpc-endpoint-create)

2. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance in your desired subnet within your VPC. You can
    choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that is compatible with your third-party
    IDE. For example, you can select an Amazon Linux 2 AMI.

3. Connect to the Amazon EC2 instance.

4. Install and Configure the IDE (Visual Studio Code or JetBrains).

5. [Install the Amazon Q extension or\
    plugin.](q-in-ide-setup.md)

6. Configure the IDE to connect via AWS PrivateLink.
