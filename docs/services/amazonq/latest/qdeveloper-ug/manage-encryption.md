<a name="manage-encryption"></a>

**Note**
This section does not apply to personal accounts (Builder IDs).

By default, Amazon Q Developer uses an AWS managed key for encryption. For some features, you can set up a customer managed key to encrypt data. For a list of features that support encryption with customer managed keys, see [Data encryption](data-encryption.md#encryption-rest).

To set the key used for encryption, complete the following procedure.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.

1. Switch to the Amazon Q Developer console.

   To use the Amazon Q Developer console, you must have the permissions defined in [Allow administrators to use the Amazon Q Developer console](id-based-policy-examples-admins.md#q-admin-setup-admin-users) .

1. Choose **Settings**.

1. Choose **Edit** in the Amazon Q Developer account details panel.

1. On the **Edit details** page, expand the **Encryption key - optional** section.

1. To use a customer managed key for encryption, select **Customize encryption settings (advanced)**.

1. In the search bar that appears, search for the name of the key you want to use for encryption or enter the key ARN.

   If you haven't created a key yet, choose **Create an AWS KMS key**, and then return to this page to add your key.

1. To disable encryption with your customer managed key and revert to an AWS managed key for encryption, deselect **Customize encryption settings (advanced)**.
