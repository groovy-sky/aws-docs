# Amazon Q Developer permissions reference

Amazon Q Developer uses two types of APIs to provide the service:

- User and administrator permissions, which can be used in policies to control usage of
Amazon Q

- Other APIs used to provide the service, which can’t be used in policies to control usage of
Amazon Q

This section provides information about the APIs used by Amazon Q Developer, and what they do.

## Amazon Q Developer permissions

You can use the following permissions as a reference when you are setting up [Authenticating with identities in Amazon Q](security-iam.md#security-iam-authentication) and
writing permissions policies that you can attach to an IAM identity (identity-based
policies).

The following table shows the Amazon Q Developer permissions that you can allow or deny access to in
policies.

###### Important

To chat with Amazon Q, an IAM identity needs permissions for the following actions:

- `StartConversation`

- `SendMessage`

- `GetConversation` (console only)

- `ListConversations` (console only)

If one of these actions isn't explicitly allowed by an attached policy, an IAM permissions
error is returned when you try to chat with Amazon Q.

###### Note

The `codewhisperer` prefix is a legacy name from a service that merged
with Amazon Q Developer. For more information, see
[Amazon Q Developer rename - Summary of changes](service-rename.md).

### Using q:PassRequest

`q:PassRequest` is an Amazon Q permission that allows Amazon Q to call AWS APIs on
your behalf. When you add the `q:PassRequest` permission to an IAM identity,
Amazon Q gains permission to call any API that the IAM identity has permission to call. For
example, if an IAM role has the `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` permission and the
`q:PassRequest` permission, Amazon Q is able to call the
`ListAllMyBuckets` API when a user assuming that IAM role asks Amazon Q to list
their Amazon S3 buckets.

You can create IAM policies that restrict the scope of the `q:PassRequest`
permission. For example, you can prevent Amazon Q from performing a specific action, or only
permit Amazon Q to perform a subset of actions for a service. You can also specify what regions
Amazon Q can make calls to when performing actions on your behalf.

For examples of IAM policies that control the use of `q:PassRequest`, see the
following identity-based policy examples:

- [Allow Amazon Q to perform actions on your behalf in chat](id-based-policy-examples-users.md#id-based-policy-examples-allow-actions)

- [Deny Amazon Q permission to perform specific actions on your behalf](id-based-policy-examples-users.md#id-based-policy-examples-deny-some-actions)

- [Allow Amazon Q permission to perform specific actions on your behalf](id-based-policy-examples-users.md#id-based-policy-examples-allow-some-actions)

- [Allow Amazon Q permission to perform actions on your behalf in specific regions](id-based-policy-examples-users.md#id-based-policy-examples-allow-actions-some-regions)

- [Deny Amazon Q permission to perform actions on your behalf](id-based-policy-examples-users.md#id-based-policy-examples-deny-actions)

## Amazon Q User Subscriptions permissions

Amazon Q Developer administrators must have the following permissions to create and manage
subscriptions for users and groups in their organization.

The following terminology is useful in understanding what subscriptions permissions do:

**User**

An individual user, represented within AWS IAM Identity Center by a unique user ID.

**Group**

A collection of users, represented within AWS IAM Identity Center by a unique group ID.

**Subscription**

A subscription is tied to a single Identity Center user, and entitles them to use
Amazon Q features. A subscription does not authorize a user to use Amazon Q features. For
example, if Adam is subscribed to Amazon Q Developer Pro, they are entitled to used Amazon Q Developer
features, but they don't have access to those features until their administrator grants
them the needed permissions.

## Other Amazon Q Developer APIs

The following table shows the APIs that are used by features of Amazon Q in the IDE. These APIs
aren’t used to control access to features of Amazon Q, but they will appear in AWS CloudTrail logs in
management accounts when users access the associated feature.
