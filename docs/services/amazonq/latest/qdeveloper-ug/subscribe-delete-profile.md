# Deleting the Amazon Q Developer profile

###### Note

This section does not apply to personal accounts (Builder IDs).

You might want to delete the Amazon Q Developer profile to quickly cancel all subscriptions and
remove all Q Developer configurations from your AWS account. When you delete the Amazon Q Developer
profile, the following occurs:

- All subscriptions associated with the profile marked as
**Canceled**, and users will no longer be able to access
Amazon Q Developer features. The final monthly subscription fee is charged at the end of the
current billing cycle for all users who had active subscriptions. You'll be charged
for the full month; the fee won't be prorated. Subscriptions will continue to be
visible in the Amazon Q Developer console until the end of the month, at which time they will
be removed from view.

- All settings and options in the Amazon Q Developer console that became available as a result
of creating the profile will no longer be visible or take effect. For example, the Q
Developer dashboard will no longer be visible, customizations will no longer be
configurable or applied, and user activity reports will no longer be configurable or
generated.

- The managed application (called
**QDevProfile- `region`**) will be
removed from the IAM Identity Center instance that is connected to Amazon Q Developer. (This IAM Identity Center instance
might be a different account from the one where the profile is being deleted,
depending on your [deployment option](deployment-options.md).)

###### Note

If you accidentally delete the profile:

- You'll have to recreate it and then resubscribe users. You'll also have to reset
any settings you configured previously through the Amazon Q Developer console. Your IAM Identity Center
instance will remain, so there is no need to recreate user identities.

- You won't be able to see historical data in the Amazon Q Developer dashboard after
recreating the profile; you can only see data starting from the date of the new
profile creation onward.

Use the following instructions to delete the Amazon Q Developer profile.
