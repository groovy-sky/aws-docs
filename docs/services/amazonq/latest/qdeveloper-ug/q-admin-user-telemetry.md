# Viewing the activity of specific users in Amazon Q Developer

You can configure Amazon Q to collect user activity telemetry of individual Amazon Q Developer subscribers in your
organization and present that information in a report. The report gives you insights into how specific
users are using Amazon Q.

Amazon Q generates the report every day at midnight (00:00) Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and saves
it in a CSV file at the following path:

`s3://bucketName/prefix/AWSLogs/accountId/QDeveloperLogs/by_user_analytic/region/year/month/day/00/accountId_by_user_analytic_timestamp.csv`

The CSV file is laid out as follows:

- Each row shows a user who interacted with Amazon Q that day.

- Each column shows a metric, as described in [User activity report metrics](user-activity-metrics.md). Metrics are calculated based on the user
telemetry collected over the course of the day.

If more than 1,000 users interact with Amazon Q during the day, Amazon Q splits the data into several CSV
files containing 1,000 users each, and having suffixes of `part_1`,
`part_2`, and so on.

###### Note

When you enable user activity reports, Amazon Q collects telemetry regardless of how a developer has
set the **Enable Amazon Q to send usage data to AWS** setting in their IDE. That
setting controls whether telemetry can be used by the _AWS corporation_, not
your organization. For more information about this setting, see [Opting out of sharing your client-side telemetry](opt-out-ide.md#opt-out-IDE-telemetry).

Use the following instructions to enable user activity reports.

**Prerequisite**

Create an Amazon S3 bucket to hold the user activity report CSV file. The bucket must:

- Be in the AWS Region where the Amazon Q Developer profile was installed. This profile was
installed when you subscribed IAM Identity Center workforce users to Amazon Q Developer Pro for the first time. For more
information about this profile and the Regions where it's supported, see [What is the Amazon Q Developer profile?](subscribe-understanding-profile.md), and [Supported Regions for the Q Developer console and Q Developer profile](q-admin-setup-subscribe-regions.md#qdev-console-and-profile-regions).

- Be in the AWS account where users are subscribed. If users are subscribed in multiple
AWS accounts, then you must create buckets in each of those accounts. Cross-account buckets
are not supported.

- (Optional but recommended) Be different from the bucket you might be using for [prompt logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/q-admin-prompt-logging.html).

- Include a prefix, also known as a subfolder, where Amazon Q will save the CSV file. The CSV file
cannot be saved in the root of the bucket.

- Have a bucket policy like the one that follows. Replace
`bucketName`, `region`,
`accountId`, and `prefix` with your own
information.
JSON

```json

{
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Sid": "QDeveloperLogsWrite",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Principal": {
                  "Service": "q.amazonaws.com"
              },
              "Action": [
                  "s3:PutObject"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                  "arn:aws:s3:::bucketName/prefix/*"
              ],
              "Condition": {
                  "StringEquals": {
                      "aws:SourceAccount": "111122223333"
                  },
                  "ArnLike": {
                      "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:codewhisperer:us-east-1:111122223333:*"
                  }
              }
          }
      ]
}

```

If you're configuring SSE-KMS on the bucket, add the below policy on the KMS key:

```json

{
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
          "Service": "q.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "kms:GenerateDataKey",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
            "aws:SourceAccount": "accountId"
          },
          "ArnLike": {
             "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:codewhisperer:region:accountId:*"
          }
      }
}
```

To learn about protecting the data in your Amazon S3 bucket, see [Protecting data with\
encryption](../../../s3/latest/userguide/usingencryption.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

###### To enable user activity reports

1. Open the Amazon Q Developer console.

To use the Amazon Q Developer console, you must have the permissions defined in [Allow administrators to use the Amazon Q Developer console](id-based-policy-examples-admins.md#q-admin-setup-admin-users).

2. Choose **Settings**.

3. Under **Q Developer user activity reports**, choose
    **Edit**.

4. Toggle **Collect granular metrics per user**.

5. Under **S3 location**, enter the Amazon S3 URI that you will use to hold the CSV
    reports. Example: `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/user-activity-reports/`
