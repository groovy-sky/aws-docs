# Asking Amazon Q to troubleshoot your resources

In the AWS Management Console, you can ask Amazon Q to troubleshoot issues you're having with your
AWS resources. When you encounter a problem, open the chat panel and describe the situation to
Amazon Q. For instance, you might enter, "I can't add an object to my S3 bucket" or "My load
balancer is returning a 503 error". Amazon Q analyzes the information you provided to identify
potential root causes. It then offers tailored solutions, step-by-step instructions, or best
practices to resolve your issue efficiently.

Amazon Q currently accepts English prompts for the issues shown in the following table.

AWS serviceType of issue that Amazon Q can help withExample prompts

Amazon S3

amzn-s3-demo-bucket.

Why can’t I delete the object
s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket-locked/Q-Stream2.jpg?

AWS Glue

Job
failures

My Glue job with the job name
'Run111B11B11- `<…>`' and the
job run id 'bb\_b1b111 `<…>`' in the
'us-west-2' region failed.

Why did my Glue job called
GlueRun00AA00A00A- `<…>` fail?

Amazon Athena

Query issues

My Athena query didn't return any results. query ID:
222c22cc-2c022- `<…>` region
id: us-east-2

I ran an Athena query with an execution ID of
333d33dd-3d33- `<…>` and a
region of us-east-1, and it didn't return any results.

Amazon ECS

Task stoppage issues; Fargate health check issues; disconnected
agent issues

My ECS task is stopped and I don't know why. The details of the task
are: Cluster: my-ecs-cluster, Service: my-ecs-service, Task Definition:
my-task-definition, Task ARN:
arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:444444444444:task/my-ecs-cluster/4ee4ee4ee4444 `<…>`

I'm having a problem with my ECS task. The task health check always
fails for the task in the 'my-ecs-cluster' cluster and service.

The Amazon ECS agent on one of my container instances appears to be
disconnected. The agent is not responding or updating its status, which
is causing tasks to be stuck in a pending state.

Amazon EC2 Elastic Load Balancing

Health check issues; 504, 503, 502, and 500 errors

Why are the health checks for the target group called
'my-target-group' failing?

Why am I receiving 503 errors from my load balancer
'my-elb'?

Amazon EKS

Application Load Balancer (ALB) ingress controller issues; managed add-on issues

I have an ALB ingress controller in my EKS cluster, and am seeing a
failure with the error message 'WebIdentityErr:failed to retrieve
credentials'. The AWS region is us-west-2.

There seems to be an issue with the add-ons in my EKS cluster called
my-eks-cluster, in the us-west-2 region.

Amazon ECR

Secondary account access issues

I'm having difficulty granting access to an Amazon ECR image repository
from a different AWS account. Specifically, I need to allow account
222222222222 to push and pull images from the repository named
"my-ecr-repo" in my account (111111111111) in the region
(us-west-2).

For Amazon Q to troubleshoot your resources, you'll need the same permissions as those outlined
