# Unsubscribing from Amazon Q Developer Pro

How you unsubscribe from the Pro tier depends on whether you're an end-user with a personal
account (Builder ID) or an administrator of IAM Identity Center workforce users.

## Unsubscribing a personal account (Builder ID)

Read this section if you want to unsubscribe your personal account (Builder ID) from the Pro
tier.

When you unsubscribe your Builder ID, your subscription is marked as **Canceled**, and you can no longer access Amazon Q Developer features. (You can still use
the [Free tier](q-tiers.md) though, provided you have not exceeded your Free
tier limits.) The final monthly subscription fee is charged at the end of the current billing
cycle. You'll be charged for the full month; the fee won't be prorated.

###### Warning

Deleting your Builder ID does not unsubscribe you. To stop being billed, you must actively
unsubscribe yourself using the instructions in this section. Similarly, deleting your
Amazon Q Developer Profile or Kiro Profile does not cancel your Builder ID subscription.

You can unsubscribe starting from one of the following interfaces:

- IDE

- command line

- AWS Management Console

## Unsubscribing IAM Identity Center workforce users

If you are the administrator of an AWS standalone account, an AWS management account, or
an AWS member account, use the following procedure to unsubscribe IAM Identity Center workforce users from
your account.

For more information about AWS management and member accounts, see [Managing AWS accounts in an organization with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts.html).

Notes about unsubscribing users:

- If you are an administrator of either a management or member account within an
organization managed by [AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html), you
can only unsubscribe users if your created their subscriptions.

- If a user has been subscribed in both member and management accounts, both account
administrators must unsubscribe the user from their respective accounts for the user
to be fully unsubscribed.

- If you are a management account administrator, you can view other accounts the user
is subscribed in by choosing **View subscriptions from member**
**accounts** on the **Settings** page of the
Amazon Q Developer console. This allows you to coordinate with member account administrators
for unsubscription. Alternatively, if you have the appropriate permissions, you can
sign in as a member account administrator and unsubscribe the user directly. For more
information about viewing member account subscriptions as a management account
administrator, see [Viewing an aggregated list of Amazon Q Developer subscriptions](subscribe-visibility.md).

- After unsubscribing users or groups, their subscriptions are marked as
**Canceled**, and they can no longer access Amazon Q Developer features.
(They can still use the [Free tier](q-tiers.md) though, provided they
have not exceeded their Free tier limits.) The final monthly subscription fee is
charged at the end of the current billing cycle for all users who had active
subscriptions. You'll be charged for the full month; the fee won't be prorated.

###### To unsubscribe a user or group you manage

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS standalone, management, or member
    account.

2. Switch to the Amazon Q Developer console.

3. In the **Identity provider users and groups** section, choose the
    **Users** or **Groups** tab.

4. Choose the user or group you want to unsubscribe.

5. Choose **More actions**.

6. Choose **Unsubscribe**.
