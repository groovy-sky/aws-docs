websites, including the AWS Management Console, AWS Console Mobile Application, and AWS Documentation site.

For policies that enable administrative access to Amazon Q Developer, see [Administrator permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/id-based-policy-examples-admins.html).

###### Note

Users accessing [Amazon Q in the IDE](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/q-in-IDE.html) or [Amazon Q on the command line](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line.html) don't require IAM

- `AWS-region` – The AWS Region where the plugin
was created.

- `AWS-account-ID` – The AWS account ID of the
account where your plugin is configured.
