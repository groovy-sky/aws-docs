# Using Amazon Q Developer for line-by-line recommendations

Depending on your use case, Amazon Q may not be able to generate an entire function block
in one recommendation. However, Amazon Q can still provide line-by-line recommendations.

Go and GoLand

In this example, Amazon Q provides line-by-line recommendations.

Here is another example of line-by-line recommendations, this time with a unit test.

C++ and CLion

In this example, Amazon Q provides line-by-line recommendations.

Python

In the following image, the customer has written an initial comment indicating that they
want to publish a message to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs group. Given this context, Amazon Q is only able to
suggest the client initialization code in its first recommendation, as shown in the following
image.

However, if the user continues to request line-by-line recommendations, Amazon Q also
continues to suggest lines of code based on what's already been written.

###### Note

In the example above, `VPCFlowLogs` may not be the correct constant value. As
Amazon Q makes suggestions, remember to rename any constants as required.

Amazon Q can eventually complete the entire code block as shown in the following
image.

In this example, Amazon Q provides recommendations, one line at at time.
