# Viewing Amazon Q Developer user activity on the dashboard

Available only for Amazon Q Developer administrators, the Amazon Q Developer dashboard summarizes useful data about how
your Pro tier subscribers use the service.

![The Amazon Q dashboard that shows total subscriptions, active subscriptions, pending subscriptions, a suggested lines of code widget, an active users widget, and filters.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/images/q-dev-dashboard.png)

Amazon Q generates and displays new metrics on an hourly basis for the most part. The only section that is
not updated hourly is the **Active users** widget, which is updated daily according to the
coordinated universal time (UTC) clock.

The dashboard shows metrics collected from users who are subscribed in:

- the AWS account that you're currently signed into

_and_

- member accounts, if you're signed in to a management account for which [organization-wide visibility of subscriptions](subscribe-visibility.md) has been
enabled.

###### Note

The **Active users** widget only displays information from the account that you're
currently signed into.

###### To view and filter the dashboard

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.

2. Switch to the Amazon Q Developer console.

3. From the navigation pane, choose **Dashboard**.

4. (Optional) Filter the information by date range, programming language, customization, or integrated development environment (IDE) vendor.

**Notes**:

- If the **Dashboard** link is not available in the navigation pane, see [Troubleshooting the dashboard](dashboard-troubleshooting.md).

- If you’d like to send user metrics to a daily report with a per-user breakdown of their Amazon Q Developer
usage, see [Viewing the activity of specific users in Amazon Q Developer](q-admin-user-telemetry.md).

- For information about specific metrics, see [Descriptions of Amazon Q Developer dashboard usage metrics](dashboard-metrics-descriptions.md) or choose the help link (![The help link.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/images/help-icon.png)) at the top-right of the dashboard page.
