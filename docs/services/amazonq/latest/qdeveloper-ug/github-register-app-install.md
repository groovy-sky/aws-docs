# Increasing usage limits and configuring details in Amazon Q Developer console

###### Note

Amazon Q Developer for GitHub is in preview release and is subject to change.

You can use Amazon Q Developer agents in GitHub for free without the need to set up an AWS account
to get started. You're provided with limited invocations per month for the feature development
and code review capabilities. You can increase your free usage at any time by registering your Amazon Q Developer app
installation with your AWS account.

By default, the **Code reviews** and **Feature**
**development** features are enabled in
GitHub when you install the app. You can disable any of these features when you register.
Registering requires an Amazon Q Developer profile to manage the features from the console. The
profile stores your settings and code recommendation
customization.

###### Important

To register the app installation in the Amazon Q Developer console, you must meet the
requirements for the GitHub organization. For more information, see [Requirements to install a GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/apps/using-github-apps/installing-a-github-app-from-a-third-party) and [OAuth apps and organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) in the _GitHub_
_documentation_.

###### To register your Amazon Q Developer installation

    console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/developer/home).

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Amazon Q Developer in GitHub**.

4. Choose **Register installation**, and then choose
    **Authorize** to be directed to GitHub.

If you previously authorized Amazon Q Developer to access your GitHub
    organization, you'll be redirected back to the Amazon Q Developer console.
    In this case, skip to step 7.

5. Sign in to your GitHub account using your GitHub credentials. If you have multiple
    accounts, choose the account where you want to provide access to Amazon Q Developer.

6. Choose **Authorize Amazon Q Developer** to provide access to your GitHub
    account. You'll be redirected back to Amazon Q Developer console after the authorization.

7. Under **Registration details**, enter your GitHub details, optionally
    configure the code reviews feature, and add tags.
1. In the **Registration name** text input filed, enter a name for
       your app installation.

2. (Optional) In the **Organization name -**
      **_optional_** text input field, enter a name for the
       organization associated with the app installation.

3. (Optional) Under **Features**, configure the **Code**
      **reviews** feature by choosing the toggle to enable or disable the feature.
       **Feature development** configuration cannot be
       modified, and is enabled by default.

4. (Optional) Under **Tags - optional**, choose **Add new**
      **tag** to add a tag that can help to search and filter your AWS resources
       in GitHub.
8. Choose **Register** to register your
    app installation in GitHub with your AWS account.

After successfully registering the app installation, you can view the registration details.
You can still enable or disable the code reviews feature, as well as add tags at a later time.
You can also delete the registration. For more information, see
