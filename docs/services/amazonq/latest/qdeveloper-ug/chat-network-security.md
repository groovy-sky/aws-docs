# Chatting about your network security

Chatting about network security is in preview,
and is subject to change.

Amazon Q can help you analyze your network security configurations, identify missing or
misconfigured AWS network security services, and provide recommendations for a stronger
network security posture. This helps you understand network security findings, implement
remediation steps, and follow security best practices without interrupting your
workflow.

When you ask Amazon Q about your network security, its responses include specific
information about your resources, related security findings, and detailed remediation
instructions as well as links to learn more in the AWS Management Console.

For more information about network security analysis with Amazon Q, see [Get insights with Amazon Q\
Developer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/nsd-security-insights.html) in the _AWS Shield network security director Developer Guide_.
