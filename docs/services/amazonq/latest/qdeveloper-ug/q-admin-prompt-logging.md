# Logging users' prompts in Amazon Q Developer

Administrators can enable the logging of all [inline\
suggestions](inline-suggestions.md) and [chat conversations](q-in-ide-chat.md) that users have
with Amazon Q in their integrated development environment (IDE). These logs can help with auditing,
debugging, analytics, and ensuring compliance.

When developers use inline suggestions, Amazon Q will log the accepted and actively rejected suggestions.
When developers chat with Amazon Q, Amazon Q will log both the developers' prompts and Amazon Q's responses. When
developers chat with [the Amazon Q Agent for software development](q-in-ide-chat.md#develop-code)
using the `/dev` command, only the prompts will be logged.

Amazon Q stores the logs in an Amazon S3 bucket that you create, at the following path:

`bucketName/prefix/AWSLogs/accountId/QDeveloperLogs/log-type/region/year/month/day/utc-hour/zipFile.gz/logFile.json`

At the previous path, `log-type` is one of the
following:

- `GenerateAssistantResponse` — holds chat logs

- `GenerateCompletions` — holds inline completion logs

- `StartTaskAssistCodeGeneration` — holds
`/dev` logs

For examples and explanations of log file contents, see [Prompt log examples in Amazon Q Developer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/q-admin-prompt-log-examples.html).

There is no charge for the prompt logging feature other than the storage cost of the Amazon S3 bucket
used to hold the logs, and a small fee for the optional KMS key used to encrypt the bucket.

Use the following instructions to enable prompt logging.

**Prerequisites**

- Make sure users are subscribed in a standalone account or, if you're using [AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html), a management account. Currently, Q Developer does not support logging
the prompts of users who are subscribed in member accounts in AWS Organizations.

- Create an Amazon S3 bucket to hold the prompt logs. The bucket must:

- Be in the AWS Region where the Amazon Q Developer profile was installed. This profile was
installed when you subscribed users to Amazon Q Developer Pro for the first time. For more
information about this profile and the Regions where it's supported, see [What is the Amazon Q Developer profile?](subscribe-understanding-profile.md), and [Supported Regions for the Q Developer console and Q Developer profile](q-admin-setup-subscribe-regions.md#qdev-console-and-profile-regions).

- Be in the AWS account where users are subscribed.

- Have a bucket policy like the one that follows. Replace
`bucketName`, `region`,
`accountId`, and `prefix` with
your own information.
JSON

```json

{
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Sid": "QDeveloperLogsWrite",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Principal": {
                  "Service": "q.amazonaws.com"
              },
              "Action": [
                  "s3:PutObject"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                  "arn:aws:s3:::bucketName/prefix/*"
              ],
              "Condition": {
                  "StringEquals": {
                      "aws:SourceAccount": "111122223333"
                  },
                  "ArnLike": {
                  "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:codewhisperer:us-east-1:111122223333:*"
                  }
              }
          }
      ]
}

```

If you're configuring SSE-KMS on the bucket, add the following policy on the KMS
key:

```json

{
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
          "Service": "q.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "kms:GenerateDataKey",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
            "aws:SourceAccount": "accountId"
          },
          "ArnLike": {
             "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:codewhisperer:region:accountId:*"
          }
      }
}
```

To learn about protecting the data in your Amazon S3 bucket, see [Protecting data with encryption](../../../s3/latest/userguide/usingencryption.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User_
_Guide_.

###### To enable prompt logging

1. Open the Amazon Q Developer console.

To use the Amazon Q Developer console, you must have the permissions defined in [Allow administrators to use the Amazon Q Developer console](id-based-policy-examples-admins.md#q-admin-setup-admin-users).

###### Note

You must sign in as a standalone account administrator, or management account
administrator. Member account administrators cannot enable prompt logging because prompt
logging is not supported for users subscribed in member accounts.

2. Choose **Settings**.

3. Under **Preferences**, choose **Edit**.

4. In the Edit preferences window, toggle **Q Developer prompt**
**logging**.

5. Under Amazon S3 location, enter the Amazon S3 URI that you will use to receive the logs. Example:
    `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/qdev-prompt-logs/`
