# Code issue severity in Amazon Q Developer code reviews

Amazon Q defines the severity of the code issues detected in your code so
you can prioritize what issues to address and track the security posture of your
application. The following sections explain what methods are used to determine the severity of
code issues and what each level of severity means.

## How severity is calculated

The severity of a code issue is determined by the detector that generated the
issue. Detectors in the [Amazon Q Detector Library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/detector-library) are each assigned a severity using the Common
Vulnerability Scoring System ( [CVSS](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator)). The
CVSS considers how the finding can be exploited in its context (for example, can it
be done over internet, or is physical access required) and what level of access can
be obtained.

The following table outlines how severity is determined based on the level of access and
level of effort required for a bad actor to successfully attack a system.

## Severity definitions

The severity levels are defined as follows.

**Critical – The code issue should be addressed**
**immediately to avoid it escalating.**

Critical code issues suggest that an attacker can gain control of the system or modify its
behavior with moderate effort. It is recommended that you treat critical findings
with the utmost urgency. You also should consider the criticality of the resource.

**High – The code issue must be addressed as a near-term**
**priority.**

High severity code issues suggest that an attacker can gain control of the system or modify
its behavior with high effort. It is recommended that you treat a high severity
finding as a near-term priority and that you take immediate remediation steps. You also should
consider the criticality of the resource.

**Medium – The code issue should be addressed as a**
**midterm priority.**

Medium severity findings can lead to crash, unresponsiveness, or unavailability of the
system. It is recommended that you investigate the implicated code at your earliest
convenience. You also should consider the criticality of the resource.

**Low – The code issue does not require action on its**
**own.**

Low severity findings suggest programming errors or anti-patterns. You do not need to take
immediate action on low severity findings, but they can provide context when you correlate them
with other issues.

**Informational – No recommended**
**action.**

Informational findings include suggestions for quality or readability improvements, or
alternative API operations. No immediate action is necessary.
