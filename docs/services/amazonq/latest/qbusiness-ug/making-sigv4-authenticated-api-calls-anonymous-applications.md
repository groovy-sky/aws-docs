# Making authenticated Amazon Q Business API calls for application environment supporting anonymous access

Amazon Q Business can securely handle data with integrated authentication and
authorization. In order to achieve this, a subset of the Amazon Q Business APIs
( [Chat](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_Chat.html), [ChatSync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_ChatSync.html), and [PutFeedback](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_PutFeedback.html)) require identity-unaware [AWS Sig V4\
credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/signing-elements.html) for the API call that is being made.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin setting up for making Sig V4 authenticated API calls for
anonymous application environments, make sure you've done the following:

- [Created an Amazon Q Business anonymous\
application environment](create-anonymous-application.md).

- Configured access to the AWS CLI.

## One-time setup

The following section outlines the steps to set up the Amazon Q Business
access for application environment that support anonymous access. You only need to perform
these steps once.

1. Create a directory named _policies_.

2. Then, in the same directory, create and save a file named
    _permspolicyforAPIanonymous.json_ with the following
    JSON.

**API permissions policy**

```

{
       "Version": "2012-10-17",,
       "Statement": [{
               "Sid": "QBusinessAnonymousConversationAPIPermissions",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "qbusiness:Chat",
                   "qbusiness:ChatSync",
                   "qbusiness:PutFeedback"
               ],
               "Resource": "arn:aws:qbusiness:{{region}}:{{account_id}}:application/{{application_id}}"
           }]
}
```

3. Finally, create and attach the policy using the following commands in the
    AWS CLI.

**Create and attach policy**

```nohighlight

aws iam \
create-role \
   --role-name
   --policy-document file://policies/permspolicyforAPIanonymous.json
```

## Workflow for each API call session

1. First, call the [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html) API to get AWS credentials. To
    do so, use the following command:

```nohighlight

aws sts
assume-role
   --role-arn role arn
   --role-session-name session-name

```

2. Then, set the following environment variables in your command line
    environment using the credentials you received as a response from the [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) API call.

```nohighlight

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="sigv4-access-key"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="sigv4-secret-key"
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="sigv4-session-token"
```

Then, make Amazon Q Business API calls using the following
    command:

```nohighlight

aws qbusiness \
chat-sync \
   --application-id application-id
   --user-message sample-chat-request
```
