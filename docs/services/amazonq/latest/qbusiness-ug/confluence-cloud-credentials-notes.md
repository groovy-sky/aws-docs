# How Amazon Q works with Confluence (Cloud) access and refresh tokens

The following are important points to note about using Confluence (Cloud) access
and refresh tokens with Amazon Q:

- If a Confluence (Cloud) access token-refresh token pair you use to connect
to Amazon Q are expired or invalid, the Amazon Q sync
process fails. If this happens, you need to generate and provide a new pair
of tokens.

- If your access token is valid but you have an invalid refresh token,
Amazon Q will sync data until the access token expires (up to
1 hour). After the access token expires, you won't be able to re-generate an
access token-refresh token pair using the expired refresh token. When both
access token and refresh token expire, the Amazon Q
Confluence (Cloud) data source connector stops syncing.

- If an access token expires during the Confluence (Cloud) connector sync
process, the connector internally regenerates a new pair of tokens using the
existing refresh token (if the provided refresh token is valid). After
regenerating the new pair of tokens, the old pair is invalidated by
Confluence (Cloud) and can't be re-used. To sync documents again after the
connector auto-regenerates tokens, you must provide a new access
token-refresh token pair.

- If you use OAuth, select **Rotate secret** if you want
Amazon Q to rotate the secret automatically so that you don’t have to
manually update the secret every time before you sync.

- As a best practice, use Confluence (Cloud) OAuth and the **Rotate**
**secret** feature for the Amazon Q connector.
