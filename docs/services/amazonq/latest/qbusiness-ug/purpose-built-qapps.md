You and your web experience users can create lightweight, purpose-built *Amazon Q Apps* within your broader Amazon Q Business application environment. Using your enterprise data, users can create a generative AI-powered app that streamlines their tasks. These Q Apps can be easily created by anyone at the click of a button, transforming their conversations with an Amazon Q Business assistant into reusable and shareable Amazon Q Apps.

Teams across your organization can create Amazon Q Apps tailored to their specific workflows and business needs. When your Amazon Q Business assistant generates useful content, users can transform those conversations into reusable apps that automate repetitive tasks and ensure consistency. The following examples show how different teams might use Amazon Q Apps:

+ Input card: Product name and key features
+ Text output card: Generates professional post with company tone
+ Text output card: Creates social-media-friendly version
Result: Team members can quickly generate consistent branded content for any product launch.

**Example Employee onboarding assistant**
An HR team creates a Amazon Q App to streamline new employee setup:
+ Input card: Employee name, department, start date
+ Plugin card: Creates Jira ticket for IT equipment setup
+ Text output card: Generates personalized welcome email
+ File upload card: Processes signed documents
