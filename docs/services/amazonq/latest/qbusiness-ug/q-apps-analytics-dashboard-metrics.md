# Amazon Q Apps Analytics dashboard metrics

The Amazon Q Apps dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key metrics to help admins
understand the performance and usage of Q Apps.

If the metrics are not populated in the dashboard, it is likely due to the absence of a
Q Apps service role or the role is not configured properly in the Amazon Q Business application environment.
Usually a banner will be displayed on the Amazon Q Business console to prompt creating and registering
the Q Apps service role.

Depending on how you set up the Amazon Q Business application environment prior to the introduction of
analytics dashboard feature, the banner might not always appear. To resolve the issue, go to
the **Admin controls and guardrails** page for the Amazon Q Business application environment,
choose **Edit Global Control** and re-save the configuration without changes.
The metrics should start populating in 10 minutes.

The following analytics are available in the Amazon Q Apps Analytics dashboard for the
specified time period.
