# Creating an Amazon Quick-integrated Amazon Q Business application

With an Amazon Quick-integrated Amazon Q Business application, Quick users authenticate through
Amazon Quick and access answers from unstructured data in Amazon Q Business. [Amazon Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/welcome.html)
is a business intelligence service that provides insights from your structured data, such as
databases, data lakes, and data warehouses.

With Quick authentication, your Amazon Quick administrator uses Quick as a single
point of entry to manage access to unstructured data in Amazon Q Business. You can manage users and
groups without reliance on AWS IAM Identity Center, including permissions, governance, and access
controls.

After you set up Quick as your authentication, users sign in through Quick with
their existing credentials. After authentication, they can use Quick Q&A and Data
Stories to get answers to questions based on your unstructured enterprise data in Amazon Q Business
and your structured data analytics.

You can create an Quick integrated Amazon Q Business application environment from Amazon Quick or you can
create it with the Amazon Q Business [CreateApplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_CreateApplication.html)
API operation.

## Considerations

The following limitations apply to the Amazon Q application.

- Quick and Amazon Q Business must exist in the same AWS account. Cross account calls
are not supported.

- Quick and Amazon Q Business accounts must exist in the same AWS Region. Cross-region
calls are not supported. For a list of all supported Quick Regions, see
[Supported AWS Regions for Amazon Q in QuickSight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/regions-aqs.html). For
a list of all supported Amazon Q Business Regions, see [Service quotas for\
Amazon Q Business](quotas-regions.md).

If your Quick account exists in more than one region, you can connect one
Amazon Q Business application from each region to the Quick account. For example,
if your Quick account exists in US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon),
one Amazon Q Business application located in US East (N. Virginia) and one Amazon Q Business
application located in US West (Oregon) can be connected to the Quick
account.

- Quick and Amazon Q Business accounts that are integrated need to use the same identity
methods. For example, if a Quick account uses IAM Identity Center for identity management,
the Amazon Q Business account that it is integrating with must also use IAM Identity Center for
identity management.

- Email addresses that are associated with Quick users and groups are used
to perform authorization checks in Amazon Q Business.

- To create an Amazon Q Business application with the [CreateApplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_CreateApplication.html) API operation, the user or role must have
permissions to create an application. For more information about setting up
Amazon Q Business, see [Setting up for Amazon Q Business](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/setting-up.html).

## Creating a Quick-integrated application from Amazon Quick

To set up an Quick-integrated Amazon Q Business application environment, Quick administrators
can create a new application from the Quick admin portal or connect to an existing
one. After you create an application environment, you create an index and add a data source in
Amazon Q Business.

- For information on setting up and managing a Quick-integrated Amazon Q Business
application from Quick, see [Augmenting Amazon QuickSight generative BI capabilities with Amazon\
Q](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/generative-bi-q-business-configure.html) in the _Amazon Quick User Guide_.

- For information about adding a data source to an Amazon Q application, see [Connecting Amazon Q Business data sources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/data-sources.html).

## Creating a Quick-integrated application with Amazon Q Business API operations

To create an Amazon Quick integrated application environment with Amazon Q Business APIs, you use the
[CreateApplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_CreateApplication.html) API operation. For `identityType`, specify
`AWS_QUICKSIGHT_IDP`. In `QuickSightConfiguration`, specify
the `clientNamespace`. This is the Quick namespace that you use as your
identity provider. For more information about Quick namespaces, see [Namespace\
operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/developerguide/namespace-operations.html).

The following example shows how to use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to create a
Quick-integrated application environment.

```nohighlight

aws qbusiness create-application \
--display-name MyQBusinessApp \
--identity-type AWS_QUICKSIGHT_IDP \
--quick-sight-configuration '{"clientNamespace": "my-quicksight-namespace"}'
```
