# How Amazon Q Business connector crawls Amazon FSx (Windows) ACLs

Connectors support crawling ACL and identity information where applicable based on the data source.
If you index documents without ACLs, all documents are considered public.
Indexing documents with ACLs ensures data security.

Amazon Q Business supports crawling ACLs for document security by default.

When you connect an Amazon FSx (Windows) data source to Amazon Q Business, Amazon Q Business crawls ACL information attached to a document (user and group
information) from the directory service of the Amazon FSx instance. If you choose to
activate ACL crawling, the information can be used to filter chat responses to your end
user's document access level.

The group and user IDs are mapped as follows:

- `_group_ids`—Group IDs exist in Amazon FSx on files
where there are set access permissions. They are mapped from the system group names
in the directory service of Amazon FSx.

- `_user_id`—User IDs exist in Amazon FSx on files where
there are set access permissions. They are mapped from the system user names in the
directory service of Amazon FSx.
