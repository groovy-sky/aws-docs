###### Actions

## Deleting an Amazon Q Business index

To delete a Amazon Q Business index, you can use the console or the
[DeleteIndex](../api-reference/api-deleteindex.md) API
operation.

If you use the console, deleting an index automatically deletes the retriever
attached to it. If you use the API, you must also use the [DeleteRetriever](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_DeleteRetriever.html) API operation to
delete the Amazon Q Business retriever attached to your index.

The following tabs provide a procedure for the AWS Management Console and code examples for
the AWS CLI.

    **Delete**.

6. In the dialog box that opens, type
    `Confirm` to confirm deletion, and

You are returned to the service console while your
    application environment is deleted. When the deletion process is
    complete, the console displays a message confirming
    successful deletion.
