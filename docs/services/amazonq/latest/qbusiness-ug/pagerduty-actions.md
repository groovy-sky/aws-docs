# Configuring a PagerDuty Advance plugin for Amazon Q Business

PagerDuty Operations Cloud is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) incident response management
platform that provides IT teams with knowledge about incidents as soon as they occur. If
you’re a PagerDuty Advance customer who has [PagerDuty Advance AI Assistant](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/pagerduty-advance) functionality turned on, you can use the Amazon Q Business PagerDuty Advance plugin to allow your end users to perform the
following actions from within their web experience chat:

- Get incidents

- Similar incidents

- Root cause incident

- Find recent changes

- Who is on-call

- Status update on incident

- Customer impact

- Update incident

To create a PagerDuty Advance plugin, you need configuration information from your
PagerDuty Advance instance to set up a connection between Amazon Q and
PagerDuty Advance and allow Amazon Q to perform actions in PagerDuty Advance.

For more information on how to use plugins during your web experience chat, see [Using\
plugins](using-plugins.md).

- [Prerequisites](#pagerduty-plugin-prereqs)

- [Service access roles](#pagerduty-plugin-iam)

- [Creating a plugin](#pagerduty-plugin-create)

## Prerequisites

Before you configure your Amazon Q PagerDuty Advance plugin, you must do
the following:

- As an admin, create a new OAuth 2.0 PagerDuty Advance app in the
PagerDuty Advance developer console with scoped permissions for performing
actions in Amazon Q. To learn how to do this, see [Register an App](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/dd91fbd09a1a1-register-an-app) in PagerDuty Advance Developer
Documentation.

- Make sure you've added following required scopes:

- `openid`

- `write`

###### Note

We recommend choosing Classic OAuth Scopes.

- Note the domain URL of your PagerDuty Advance instance. For example:
`https://api.pagerduty.com`.

- Note your:

- **Access token URL** – For
PagerDuty Advance OAuth applications, this is
`https://identity.pagerduty.com/oauth/token`.

- **Authorization URL** – For
PagerDuty Advance OAuth applications, this is
`https://identity.pagerduty.com/oauth/authorize`.

- **Redirect URL** – The URL to
which user needs to be redirected after authentication. If your deployed
web url is `<q-endpoint>`, use
`<q-endpoint>/oauth/callback` . Amazon Q Business will handle OAuth tokens in this URL. This callback
URL needs to be allowlisted in your third-party application.

- **Client ID** – The client ID
generated when you create your OAuth 2.0 application in
PagerDuty Advance.

- **Client secret** – The client
secret generated when you create your OAuth 2.0 application in
PagerDuty Advance.

You will need this authentication information during the plugin configuration
process.

## Service access roles

To successfully connect Amazon Q to PagerDuty Advance, you need to give Amazon Q
the following permission to access your Secrets Manager secret to get your PagerDuty Advance
credentials. Amazon Q assumes this role to access
your PagerDuty Advance credentials.

The following is the service access IAM role required:

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:secretsmanager:{{your-region}}:{{your-account-id}}:secret:[[secret-id]]"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

To allow Amazon Q to assume a role, use the following trust policy:

```json

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "QBusinessApplicationTrustPolicy",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "qbusiness.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:SourceAccount": "{{source_account}}"
        },
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:SourceArn":"arn:aws:qbusiness:{{your-region}}:{{source_account}}:application/{{application_id}}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

If you use the console and choose to create a new IAM role,
Amazon Q creates the role for you. If you use the console and choose
to use an existing secret, or you use the API, make sure your IAM role contains these
permissions.

## Creating a plugin

To create a PagerDuty Advance plugin for your web experience chat, you can use the
AWS Management Console or the [CreatePlugin](../api-reference/api-createplugin.md) API operation. The
following tabs provide a procedure for creating a PagerDuty Advance plugin using the
console and code examples for the AWS CLI.
