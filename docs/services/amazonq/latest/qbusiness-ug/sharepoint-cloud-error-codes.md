# Understand error codes in the SharePoint (Online) connector
<a name="sharepoint-cloud-error-codes"></a>

The following table provides information about error codes you may see for the Microsoft SharePoint connector and suggested resolutions. If you used the Amazon Q section of the AWS [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) to configure your connectors, be sure to make the changes associated with an error through the console as well. You can refer to the Microsoft SharePoint [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/) for more information regarding SharePoint settings and details.
