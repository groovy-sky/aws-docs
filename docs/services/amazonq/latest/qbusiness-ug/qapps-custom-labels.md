# Custom labels for Amazon Q Apps

To organize and classify apps based on your unique business needs, Administrators can
customize the labels available for published Q Apps. You can add up to 10 labels, and
remove or update existing labels. Labels help web experience users find Q Apps in the
library.

For example, you might add custom HR organization-specific labels like
_Employee onboarding_ and _Benefits_
_inquiries_. When members of your HR team create and use Q Apps, they can use
these labels to classify them and help other users find the apps they need.

## Prerequisites for customizing labels

Before your web experience users can use custom labels, the web experience IAM
role for your application environment must have permission to perform the
`qapps:ListCategories` action. We recommend updating the
`QAppsResourceAgnosticPermissions` statement of the IAM policy
attached to this role to include the action as follows:

```json

{
"Sid": "QAppsResourceAgnosticPermissions",
"Effect": "Allow",
"Action": [
    "qapps:CreateQApp",
    "qapps:PredictQApp",
    "qapps:PredictProblemStatementFromConversation",
    "qapps:PredictQAppFromProblemStatement",
    "qapps:ListQApps",
    "qapps:ListLibraryItems",
    "qapps:CreateSubscriptionToken"
    "qapps:ListCategories"
],
"Resource": "arn:aws:qbusiness:us-west-2:account-number:application/application-id"
}
```

## Considerations for customizing labels

When you add labels, note the following:

- The maximum number of labels for an application environment is 10. This includes
predefined labels.

- You can't add duplicate labels.

- Labels can't include special characters.

## Customizing labels

To customize labels available in an application environment for Q Apps, you can use the
Amazon Q Business console or the following API operations.

- [ListCategories](../api-reference/api-qapps-listcategories.md)

- [BatchUpdateCategory](../api-reference/api-qapps-batchupdatecategory.md)

- [BatchCreateCategory](../api-reference/api-qapps-batchcreatecategory.md)

- [BatchDeleteCategory](../api-reference/api-qapps-batchdeletecategory.md)

After you save your changes, the label updates appear in the web experience
immediately. If users don't see the changes, make sure you have configure
permissions for the web experience IAM role for your application environment correctly. For
more information, see [Prerequisites for customizing labels](#qapps-labels-prerequisites).

The following shows how to customize Q Apps with the Amazon Q Business console or the
AWS Command Line Interface.

To customize labels for Q Apps, navigate to the
**Q Apps** page for your application environment, choose the
**Settings** tab, and add, update, or remove
labels.

###### To customize labels

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business
    console.

2. In **Applications**, choose the name of your
    application environment from the list of applications.

3. From the left navigation menu, choose
    **Enhancements**, and then choose
    **Amazon Q Apps**.

4. Choose the **Settings** tab, and add, update, or
    remove labels.

5. Choose **Save**. After you save your changes, the
    label updates appear in the web experience immediately.

To customize labels with the AWS CLI, use the `list-categories`,
`batch-update-category`, `batch-create-category`
or `batch-delete-category` commands.

- To view all custom labels for your application environment, use the
`list-categories` command.

```nohighlight

aws qapps list-categories --instance-id instanceId --region region
```

- If you have reached the 10 label limit, you can use the
`batch-update-category` command to update an existing
category name.

```nohighlight

aws qapps batch-update-category \
  --instance-id instanceId \
  --categories '[{"id":"existingCategoryId","title":"updatedCategoryName"}]' \
  --region region
```

- If you have less than 10 labels, you can use the
`batch-create-category` command to add new
labels.

```nohighlight

aws qapps batch-create-category \
  --instance-id  instanceId \
  --categories '[{"id":"uniqueId","title":"newCategoryName"}]' \
  --region region
```

- To delete categories, use the `batch-delete-category`
command. For `categories`, specify the list of IDs of the
categories to be deleted.

```nohighlight

aws qapps batch-delete-category \
  --instance-id instanceId \
  --categories '["categoryId1", "categoryId2"]' \
  --region region
```
