# Add your website as an allowed URL

To configure allowed websites for your existing web experience, you can use the
Amazon Q Business console or the Amazon Q Business API.

###### Note

- The allowed _base URLs_ must begin with
`https://` or `http://`.

- You must only submit a _base URL_, and not the full
path. For example, `https://docs.aws.amazon.com`.

1. Sign in to the [Amazon Q console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/business).

2. Choose **Applications**, then select the name of your
    application from the list.

###### Note

- Copy and save the **Deployed URL** for
your Amazon Q application. You'll need this URL
when you embed the web experience on your website.

- For [anonymous applications](create-anonymous-application.md), the
**Deployed URL** must be generated
every time using the ` CreateAnonymousWebExperienceUrl` API
operation. For more information, see [Share an anonymous web experience](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/supported-exp-actions-anonymous.html#create-experience-anonymous-url).

3. From the left navigation pane, choose **Amazon Q**
**embedded** under the **Enhancements**
    section.

4. On the main page, choose **Add allowed website** and
    enter the _base URL_ of the website where you'll be
    embedding the Amazon Q Business web experience.

```nohighlight

aws qbusiness update-web-experience \
  --application-id application-id \
  --web-experience-id web-experience-id \
  --origins origins

aws qbusiness get-web-experience \
  --application-id application-id \
  --web-experience-id experience-id

```

The `get-web-experience` operation will return the
`defaultEndpoint`, which is the web experience URL that you will
embed in your website.
