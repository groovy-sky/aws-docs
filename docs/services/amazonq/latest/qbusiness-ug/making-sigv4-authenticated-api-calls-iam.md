# Making authenticated Amazon Q Business API calls using IAM federation

Amazon Q Business can securely handle data with integrated authentication and
authorization. During data ingestion, Amazon Q Business preserves the
authorization information—access control lists (ACLs)—from the data source
so users can only request answers from the data they already have access to. Through
IAM Federation, Amazon Q Business uses [trusted identity propagation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/using-apps-with-trusted-token-issuer.html) to ensure that an end user
is authenticated and receives fine-grained authorization to their user ID and
group-based resources.

In order to achieve this, a subset of the Amazon Q Business APIs ( [Chat](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_Chat.html),
[ChatSync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_ChatSync.html), [SearchRelevantContent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_SearchRelevantContent.html), [ListConversations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_ListConversations.html), [ListMessages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_ListMessages.html), [DeleteConversation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_DeleteConversation.html), [PutFeedback](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_PutFeedback.html)) require identity-aware [AWS Sig V4\
credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/signing-elements.html) for the authenticated user on whose behalf the API call is being
made.

This page provides an overview of the workflows needed to obtain AWS Sig V4
credentials for a user authenticated using an identity provider (IdP), such as
Okta. While we use Okta as an example, the same
principles and steps apply to any other identity provider synced with your IAM
instance.

###### Important

Amazon Q Business doesn't support OIDC for Google and
Microsoft Entra ID.

###### Note

Federated groups aren't supported through IAM Federation. If you want to ingest
federated groups, use the [PutGroup](../api-reference/api-putgroup.md) API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin setting up for making Sig V4 authenticated API calls, make sure
you've done the following:

- [Created an Amazon Q Business\
application](../api-reference/api-createapplication.md).

- Created an Okta IdP instance and configured users and
groups within it. While we use Okta as an example, the same
principles and steps apply to any other identity provider connected to your
IAM instance.

- Created an IAM instance for your Amazon Q Business application and
connected Okta as your identity source.

- Configured access to the AWS CLI.

## One-time setup

The following section outlines the steps to set up the Amazon Q Business
control plane. You only need to perform these steps once.

1. Create an [OIDC app integration](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_oidc.htm) in Okta.

2. Create the IAM identity provider using the following command:

```nohighlight

aws iam \
create-open-id-connect-provider \
   --url issuer-url
```

Then, copy the `OpenIDConnectProviderArn` from the
    output.

3. Next, create the IAM role. To do so, perform the following steps:
1. Create a directory named `policies`.

2. In that directory, create and save a file named
       `trustpolicyforfederation.json` with the following
       JSON included:
4. Next, create the IAM policy for your web experience. To do so, perform
    the following steps:
1. In the `policies` directory, create and save a new file
       named `permspolicyforfederation.json` with the following
       JSON included:
5. Finally, create and attach the roles in IAM using the following
    command:

```nohighlight

aws iam \
create-role \
   --role-name
   --assume-role-policy-document file://policies/trustpolicyforfederation.json \
   --policy-document file://policies/permspolicyforfederation.json

```

## Workflow for each API call session for authenticated user

1. First, use the `IdToken` from Okta to call the
    [AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html) API to get AWS
    credentials. To do so, use the following command:

```nohighlight

aws sts
assume-role-with-web-identity
   --role-arn role arn
   --role-session-name session-name
   --web-identity-token id-token-from-okta
```

2. Then, set the following environment variables in your command line
    environment using the credentials you received as a response from the [AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html) API call.

```nohighlight

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="identity-aware-sigv4-access-key"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="identity-aware-sigv4-secret-key"
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="identity-aware-sigv4-session-token"
```

3. Then, make Amazon Q Business API calls using the following
    command:

```nohighlight

aws qbusiness \
chat-sync \
   --application-id application-id
   --user-message sample-chat-request
```
