# Connecting Amazon Q Business to Google Calendar using the console (Preview)

The following procedure outlines how to connect Amazon Q Business to
Google Calendar using the AWS Management Console.

###### Connecting Amazon Q to Google Calendar

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business
     console.

02. From the left navigation menu, choose **Data**
    **sources**.

03. From the **Data sources** page, choose
     **Add data source**.

04. Then, on the **Add data sources** page, from
     **Data sources**, add the **Google Calendar** data source to your Amazon Q application.

05. Then, on the **Google Calendar** data source page, enter
     the following information:

06. **Name and description**, do the following:

- For **Data source name** – Name your data
source for easy tracking.

###### Note

You can include hyphens (-) but
not spaces. Maximum of 1,000 alphanumeric characters.

- **Description –**
**_optional_** – Add an optional
description for your data source. This text is viewed only by Amazon Q Business administrators and can be edited later.

07. **Authorization** – Amazon Q Business crawls ACL information by default to ensure responses are generated only from
     documents your end users have access to. If supported for your connector, you can manage ACLs by selecting **Enable ACLs** to enable ACLs or **Disable ACLs** to disable them.
     To manage ACLs, you need specific IAM permissions. See [Grant permission to create data sources with ACLs disabled](setting-up.md#DisableAclOnDataSource) for more details.

     See [Authorization](connector-concepts.md#connector-authorization) for more details.

08. In **Authentication**, Choose between Google service account
     or OAuth 2.0 authentication, based on your use case.

09. AWS Secrets Manager secret – Choose an existing secret or create a Secrets
     Manager secret to store your Google Calendar authentication credentials. If you
     choose to create a secret, an **AWS Secrets Manager secret**
     window opens.
    1. If you choose **Existing**, select an existing secret
        for **Select secret**.

    2. If you choose New, enter the following information in the New AWS
        Secrets Manager secret section:
       1. **Secret Name** – A name for your
           secret.

       2. If you chose Google service account, enter the following
           information:
          1. **Client email** – The email
              ID of the service account.

          2. **Admin account email** –The
              email ID of the admin user (the email used by the
              Service Account User) in your Google service account
              configuration.

          3. **Private key** – The private
              key created in your Google service account.

          4. Choose **Save and add**
             **secret**.
    3. If you chose OAuth 2.0 authentication, enter the details of Secret
        Name, Client ID, Client secret and Refresh token that you created in
        your service account. Then, choose Save and add secret.
10. **Configure VPC and security group –**
    **_optional_** – Choose
     whether you want to use a VPC. If you do, enter the following
     information:

    1. **Subnets** – Select up to 6
        repository subnets that define the subnets and IP ranges
        the repository instance uses in the selected VPC.

    2. **VPC security groups** –
        Choose up to 10 security groups that allow access to
        your data source. Ensure that the security group allows
        incoming traffic from Amazon EC2 instances and
        devices outside your VPC. For databases, security group
        instances are required.

For more information, see [VPC](connector-concepts.md#connector-vpc).

11. **IAM role** – Choose
     an existing IAM role or create an IAM role to access your repository credentials and
     index content.

    ###### Note

    Creating a new service IAM role is recommended.

    For more information, see [IAM role](gcal-connector.md#gcal-iam).

12. In Sync scope, choose from the following options:

- **All calendars**: Add all the calendars
to the index.

- **Specific calendars only**: Add email
addresses associated to only the calendars you want to include in your
index.

- **Exclude specific calendars**: Add email
addresses for the calendars you want to exclude from your index.

13. **Advanced settings**

    **Document deletion safeguard** \- _optional_–To safeguard
     your documents from deletion during a sync job, select **On** and enter an integer between 0 - 100. If
     the percentage of documents to be deleted in your sync job exceeds the percentage you selected, the
     delete phase will be skipped and no documents from this data source will be deleted from your index. For more information, see
     [Document deletion safeguard](connector-concepts.md#document-deletion-safeguard).

14. For **Sync mode**, choose how you want to update your index
     when your data source content changes. When you sync your data source with
     Amazon Q for the first time, all content is synced by
     default.

- **Full sync** – Sync all content regardless of
the previous sync status.

- **New, modified, or deleted content sync** –
Sync only new, modified, and deleted documents.

15. In **Sync run schedule**, for
     **Frequency** – Choose how often
     Amazon Q will sync with your data
     source. For more details, see [Sync run schedule](connector-concepts.md#connector-sync-run). To learn how to start a data sync job,
     see [Starting data source connector sync jobs](supported-datasource-actions.md#start-datasource-sync-jobs).

16. **Tags - _optional_** –
     Add tags to search and filter your resources or track your AWS costs. See [Tags](tagging.md) for more details.

17. **Field mappings** – A list of data source document
     attributes to map to your index fields.

    ###### Note

    Add or update the fields from the **Data**
    **source details** page after you finish adding your data source.

    You can choose from two types of fields:

    1. **Default** – Automatically created by
        Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
        can't edit these.

    2. **Custom** – Automatically created by
        Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
        can edit these. You can also create and add new custom fields.

       ###### Note

       Support for adding custom fields varies by connector. You
       won't see the **Add field** option if your
       connector doesn't support adding custom fields.

For more information, see [Field mappings](connector-concepts.md#connector-field-mappings).

18. In **Data source details**, choose **Sync**
    **now** to allow Amazon Q to begin syncing (crawling and
     ingesting) data from your data source. When the sync job finishes, your data
     source is ready to use.

    ###### Note

    View CloudWatch logs for your data source sync job by selecting **View**
    **CloudWatch logs**. If you encounter a `Resource not found
                                exception` error, wait and try again as logs may not be available
    immediately.

    You can also view a detailed document-level report by selecting
    **View Report**. This report shows the status of each
    document during the crawl, sync, and index stages, including any errors. If
    the report is empty for an in-progress job, check back later as data is
    emitted to the report as events occur during the sync process.

    For more information, see [Troubleshooting data source\
    connectors](troubleshooting-data-sources.md#troubleshooting-data-sources-not-indexed).
