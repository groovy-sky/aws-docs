# Setting up for Amazon Q Business

Before you begin using Amazon Q Business for the first time, complete the following
tasks.

###### Topics

- [Sign up for an AWS account](#sign-up-for-aws)

- [(Optional) Install the AWS CLI](#cli-install-setup)

- [(Optional) Set up the AWS SDKs](#service-sdk-setup)

- [Consider AWS Regions and endpoints](#service-endpoints)

- [Set up required permissions](#permissions)

## Sign up for an AWS account

To get started with AWS, you need an AWS account. For information about creating an AWS account, see
[Getting started with an AWS account](../../../accounts/latest/reference/getting-started.md)
in the _AWS Account Management Reference Guide_.

## (Optional) Install the AWS CLI

The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified developer tool for managing
AWS services, including Amazon Q Business.

1. To install the AWS CLI, follow the instructions in [Installing the AWS Command Line\
    Interface](../../../cli/latest/userguide/installing.md) in the _AWS Command Line_
_Interface User Guide_.

2. To configure the AWS CLI and set up a profile to call the AWS CLI, follow the instructions in [Configuring the AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.md) in the _AWS Command_
_Line Interface User Guide_.

3. To confirm that the AWS CLI profile is configured, run the following
    command:

```

aws configure ––profile default
```

If your profile has been configured correctly, you will see output similar to the
    following:

```

AWS Access Key ID [****************52FQ]:
AWS Secret Access Key [****************xgyZ]:
Default region name [us-west-2]:
Default output format [json]:
```

4. To verify that the AWS CLI is configured for use with Amazon Q Business, run the following commands:

```

aws qbusiness help
```

If the AWS CLI is configured correctly, you will see a list of the
    supported AWS CLI commands for Amazon Q Business, Amazon Q Business
    runtime, and Amazon Q Business events.

## (Optional) Set up the AWS SDKs

Download and install the AWS SDKs that you want to use. This guide provides
examples for Python. For information about other AWS SDKs, see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/tools).

The package for the Python SDK is called
_Boto3_.

Before you run the following Python commands, you must first download and
install [Python 3.6 or\
later](https://www.python.org/downloads) for your operating system. Support for Python 3.5 and earlier
is deprecated.

If you don't have pip included in your Python Scripts
directory, you can download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and store this in your Scripts directory. You can also set your
Python directory as a [Path or environment\
variable](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html) using a terminal program.

To install Python, complete the following steps:

```python

# Install the latest Boto3 release via pip
pip install boto3

# You can install a specific version of Boto3 for compatibility reasons
# Install Boto3 version 1.0 specifically
pip install boto3==1.0.0

# Make sure Boto3 is no older than version 1.15.0
pip install boto3>=1.15.0

# Avoid versions of Boto3 newer than version 1.15.3
pip install boto3<=1.15.3
```

To use Boto3, you must set up authentication credentials for your
AWS account using the [IAM\
console](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-credentials-access-keys.md#Using_CreateAccessKey).

## Consider AWS Regions and endpoints

An _endpoint_ is a URL that's the entry point for a web
service. Each endpoint is associated with a specific AWS Region.

If you use a combination of the Amazon Q Business console, the AWS CLI,
and the Amazon Q Business SDKs, pay attention to their default Regions. All Amazon Q Business components of a given application must be created in the same Region.
Examples of a component include a retriever, an index, and a chat experience. To understand
why this is important, see [Considerations for choosing an AWS Region](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-started-prereqs-considerations.md) in the IAM Identity Center User
Guide.

For regions and endpoints supported by Amazon Q Business, see [Service quotas\
for Amazon Q Business](quotas-regions.md).

## Set up required permissions

If you use Amazon Q Business through the AWS Management Console, basic required permissions are
added on your behalf.

To use Amazon Q Business as an IAM user on the AWS CLI, or AWS SDK, you must
attach the following permissions to allow Amazon Q Business to create and manage
resources on your behalf:

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "QBusinessFullAccessPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "qbusiness:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

If you're using Q Apps, add the following permissions:

```json

"qapps:*"
```

If you're using Q Apps, add the following permissions:

```json

"quicksight:*"
```

If you're using a customer managed key, add the following permissions:

```json

"kms:DescribeKey"
"kms:CreateGrant"
```

If you're using IAM Identity Center, add the following permissions:

```json

"sso:CreateApplication",
"sso:PutApplicationAuthenticationMethod",
"sso:PutApplicationAccessScope",
"sso:PutApplicationGrant",
"sso:DeleteApplication",
"organizations:DescribeOrganization",
"sso-directory:DescribeGroup",
"sso-directory:DescribeUser",
"sso:DescribeApplication",
"sso:DescribeInstance"
```

To assign user subscriptions to applications, you must include permissions to call the
necessary user subscription-related APIs. The subscription-related APIs give permission to
create, update, cancel, and view all user subscriptions for an application. You can assign
user subscriptions through both the Amazon Q Business console and programmatically using
the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs.

**To allow Amazon Q to assign user subscriptions, use the following**
**role policy:**

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "QBusinessSubscriptionPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "qbusiness:UpdateSubscription",
                "qbusiness:CreateSubscription",
                "qbusiness:CancelSubscription",
                "qbusiness:ListSubscriptions"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:qbusiness:us-east-1:111122223333:application/application-id",
                "arn:aws:qbusiness:us-east-1:111122223333:application/application-id/subscription/subscription-id"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "QBusinessServicePermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "user-subscriptions:UpdateClaim",
                "user-subscriptions:CreateClaim",
                "organizations:DescribeOrganization",
                "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole",
                "sso-directory:DescribeGroup",
                "sso-directory:DescribeUser",
                "sso:DescribeApplication",
                "sso:DescribeInstance"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

### Grant permission to create data sources with ACLs disabled

By default, when Amazon Q administrators create data sources, ACLs are on.
Some administrators may want to create data sources with ACLs disabled. You can grant them
permission by attaching the IAM action `DisableAclOnDataSource` to their role
or policy. With this permission, the administrator can create data sources with the ACL
field disabled. If an administrator creates a data source with the ACL field set to enabled,
they can't change the field to disabled. If they want to use a data source with ACLs
disabled, they need to create a new data source.

We don't recommend disabling ACLs in production environments.

###### Warning

When ACLs are disabled for a data source, all documents ingested by the data source
become accessible to all end users of the Amazon Q Business application.

You can check if data source connectors were created with ACLs disabled and whether
Amazon Q administrators have the `DisableAclOnDataSource` IAM
policy. To check ACLs on a data source, review `CreateDataSource` and
`UpdateDataSource` event logs in CloudTrail. To check if administrators have been
granted the `DisableAclOnDataSource` IAM action, review permissions in the IAM
console.

As a best practice, we recommend you use an explicit deny on the
`DisableAclOnDataSource` IAM action and that you only grant the
`DisableAclOnDataSource` permission when requested by Amazon Q
administrators.

###### Note

This feature is only available for use with the following connectors:
ServiceNow Online, Confluence, SharePoint,
Jira, Google Drive, OneDrive,
Salesforce, Zendesk, GitHub, MS
Teams, and Slack.

###### Example An example policy using `qbusiness:DisableAclOnDataSource`

The following is an example policy showing how to use
`qbusiness:DisableAclOnDataSource`

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ExplicitDenyACLDisable",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": [
                "qbusiness:DisableAclOnDataSource"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```
