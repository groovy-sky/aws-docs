# Connecting Amazon Q Business to SharePoint (Online) using the console

The following procedure outlines how to connect Amazon Q Business to
SharePoint (Online) using the AWS Management Console.

###### Connecting Amazon Q to SharePoint (Online)

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business
     console.

02. From the left navigation menu, choose **Data**
    **sources**.

03. From the **Data sources** page, choose
     **Add data source**.

04. Then, on the **Add data sources** page, from
     **Data sources**, add the **SharePoint** data source to your Amazon Q application.

05. Then, on the **SharePoint (Online)** data source page, enter
     the following information:

06. **Name and description**, do the following:

- For **Data source name** – Name your data
source for easy tracking.

###### Note

You can include hyphens (-) but
not spaces. Maximum of 1,000 alphanumeric characters.

- **Description –**
**_optional_** – Add an optional
description for your data source. This text is viewed only by Amazon Q Business administrators and can be edited later.

07. In **Source**, enter the following information:
    1. In **Source**, for **Hosting**
       **Method** – Choose **SharePoint**
       **Online**.

    2. **Site URLs specific to your SharePoint repository**
        – Enter the SharePoint host URLs. The format for the host URLs
        you enter is
        `https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite`
        or `https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com`. The
        URL must start with `https` protocol. Separate URLs with a
        new line. You can add up to 100 URLs.

    3. **Domain** – Enter the
        SharePoint domain. For example, the domain in the URL
        `https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite`
        is `yourdomain`. Note that the domain name in
        the URL and the domain name you're expected to enter in the domain field
        can be different.
08. **Authorization** – Choose whether Amazon Q
     will crawl user and group access control list (ACL) information from your data
     source. Amazon Q can use this information to only generate responses
     from documents your end users have access to. You can manage ACLs by selecting
     **Enable ACLs** to enable ACLs or **Disable**
    **ACLs** to disable them. To manage ACLs, you need specific IAM
     permissions. See [Grant permission to create data sources with ACLs\
     disabled](setting-up.md#DisableAclOnDataSource) for more details. See [Authorization](connector-concepts.md#connector-authorization) for more details.

    ###### Note

    Using ACL data to filter responses is not a replacement for user
    authentication and authorization for your application. For information on
    setting up identity management for Amazon Q, see [Integrating with an Identity Provider\
    (IdP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/idp-integration.html).

    ###### Important

    If you don't specify a value, **Email** is considered as
    the default value.

09. For **Authentication**, choose between
     **Basic**, **Oauth 2.0**, **Azure**
    **AD App-Only authentication**, and **SharePoint App-Only**
    **authentication** based on your use case.

    ###### Note

    OneNote can only be crawled by the connector using a Tenant ID, and with
    OAuth 2.0, or SharePoint (Online) App Only authentication activated.

    1. If using **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) App-Only authentication**, enter
        the following information:

- **Tenant ID** – Tenant ID of your
SharePoint account. To learn how to find your
Tenant ID, see [Get subscription and tenant IDs in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/get-subscription-tenant-id)
in Azure portal documentation.

- **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) self-signed X.509 certificate**
– Certificate to authenticate the connector for Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).
For more information on how to do this, see [Granting access via Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) App-Only](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread) and
New-PnPAzureCertificate in _Microsoft_
_developer documentation_.

- **Generate a certificate using OpenSSL**
– As an example:

```

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout /path/to/folder/private.key -out /path/to/folder/sharepoint.crt -days 365 -subj "/CN=ExampleCorp/emailAddress=example@domain.com
/C=US/ST=Texas/L=Dallas/O=ExampleCorp/OU=IT" -set_serial 1
```

###### Note

Avoid using the -sha1 flag when generating certificates. SHA-1 is considered insecure and deprecated. Most modern browsers and
systems reject certificates signed with SHA-1. By default, OpenSSL uses a secure algorithm such as SHA-256 when the -sha1 flag is omitted.

- For **AWS**
**Secrets Manager secret** – Choose an
existing secret or create a Secrets Manager secret to store
your SharePoint authentication credentials. If you choose to
create a secret, an AWS Secrets Manager secret window opens. Enter the

your secret.

- **Client ID** – The Client ID
generated when you complete Azure App registration for
SharePoint (Online) in Entra
ID.

- **Private key** – A private
key to authenticate the connector for Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).

- **Register a new app in the Microsoft Azure**
**portal**:

1. Log in to the Azure Portal with your
    Microsoft account.

2. Choose New Registration:

01. Provide the name for your application. In
     the example we are using the name
     `TargetApp`. The Amazon Q Business
     application uses TargetApp to connect to the
     SharePoint Online site to crawl and index the
     data.

02. Choose "Accounts" in the organizational
     directory. ( `Tenant name` only - Single
     tenant).

03. Choose "Register".

04. Note down the application (client ID and the
     directory (tenant) on the Overview page, as you'll
     need them when prompted for "TargetApp-ClientId"
     and "TenantId".

05. Choose API permissions under "Manage" in the
     navigation pane.

06. Choose "Add a permission" to allow the
     application to read data in your organization's
     directory regarding the signed-in user.

07. Choose "Sharepoint".

08. Choose "Application permissions".

09. Choose "Sites.FullControl.All" from the User
     section.

10. Choose "Add permissions".

3. On the options menu, choose to "Remove" a

     whether you want to use a VPC. If you do, enter the following
     information:

    1. **Subnets** – Select up to 6
        repository subnets that define the subnets and IP ranges
        the repository instance uses in the selected VPC.

    2. **VPC security groups** –
        Choose up to 10 security groups that allow access to
        your data source. Ensure that the security group allows
        incoming traffic from Amazon EC2 instances and
        devices outside your VPC. For databases, security group
        instances are required.

For more information, see [VPC](connector-concepts.md#connector-vpc).

The SharePoint connector supports Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) groups associated with documents. In order
for Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) group members to search the data, you have to integrate Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) with IAM
Identity Center.

1. **IAM role** – Choose
    an existing IAM role or create an IAM role to access your repository credentials and
    index content.

###### Note

Creating a new service IAM role is recommended.

For more information, see [IAM role](sharepoint-cloud-connector.md#sharepoint-cloud-iam).

2. In **Sync scope**, choose from the following options :
1. **Select entities** – Choose the entities that
       you want to crawl. You can select to crawl **All**
       entities or any combination of **Files**,
       **Attachments**, **Links**,
       **Pages**, **Events**,
       **Comments**, and **List**
      **Data**.

2. For **Maximum file size** – Specify the file
       size limit in MBs that Amazon Q will crawl. Amazon Q will crawl only
       the files within the size limit you define. The default file size is
       50MB. The maximum file size should be greater than 0MB and less than or
       equal to 50MB.

3. In **Additional configuration –**
      **_optional_**, for **Entity**
      **regex patterns** – Add regular expression patterns
       for **Links**, **Pages**, and
       **Events** to include specific entities instead of
       syncing all your documents.

4. In **Additional configuration**, for **Regex**
      **patterns** – Add regular expression patterns to
       include or exclude files by **File path**,
       **File name**, **File type**,
       **OneNote section name**, and **OneNote**
      **page name** instead of syncing all your documents. You can
       add up to 100 patterns.

      ###### Note

      Any valid regex pattern is supported. For example, if you use the
      regex `^QBusiness*`, any content starting with the word
      `QBusiness` followed by any number of characters will
      be filtered ( `QBusiness_doc1` or `QBusiness`,
      but not `doc1_QBusiness`).

      ###### Note

      OneNote crawling is available only for OAuth 2.0 and SharePoint
      App Only authentication.

5. **Multi-media content configuration – optional** –
       To enable content extraction from embedded images and visuals in documents, choose **Visual content in documents**.

      To extract audio transcriptions and video content, enable processing for the following file types:

6. **Advanced settings**

      **Document deletion safeguard** \- _optional_–To safeguard
       your documents from deletion during a sync job, select **On** and enter an integer between 0 - 100. If
       the percentage of documents to be deleted in your sync job exceeds the percentage you selected, the
       delete phase will be skipped and no documents from this data source will be deleted from your index. For more information, see
       [Document deletion safeguard](connector-concepts.md#document-deletion-safeguard).
3. In **Sync mode**, choose how you
    want to update your index when your data source
    content changes. When you sync your data source with
    Amazon Q for the first time, all content
    is synced by default.

- **Full sync** – Sync
all content regardless of the previous sync
status.

- **New or modified content**
**sync** – Sync only new and modified
documents.

- **New, modified, or deleted**
**content sync** – Sync only new,
modified, and deleted documents.

For more details, see [Sync mode](connector-concepts.md#connector-sync-mode).

4. In **Sync run schedule**, for
    **Frequency** – Choose how often
    Amazon Q will sync with your data
    source. For more details, see [Sync run schedule](connector-concepts.md#connector-sync-run). To learn how to start a data sync job,
    see [Starting data source connector sync jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/supported-datasource-actions.html#start-datasource-sync-jobs).

5. **Tags - _optional_** –
    Add tags to search and filter your resources or track your AWS costs. See [Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/tagging.html) for more details.

6. **Field mappings** – A list of data source document
    attributes to map to your index fields.

###### Note

Add or update the fields from the **Data**
**source details** page after you finish adding your data source.

You can choose from two types of fields:

1. **Default** – Automatically created by
       Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
       can't edit these.

2. **Custom** – Automatically created by
       Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
       can edit these. You can also create and add new custom fields.

      ###### Note

      Support for adding custom fields varies by connector. You
      won't see the **Add field** option if your
      connector doesn't support adding custom fields.

For more information, see [Field mappings](connector-concepts.md#connector-field-mappings).

7. In **Data source details**, choose **Sync**
**now** to allow Amazon Q to begin syncing (crawling and
    ingesting) data from your data source. When the sync job finishes, your data
    source is ready to use.

###### Note

View CloudWatch logs for your data source sync job by selecting **View**
**CloudWatch logs**. If you encounter a `Resource not found
                               exception` error, wait and try again as logs may not be available
immediately.

You can also view a detailed document-level report by selecting
**View Report**. This report shows the status of each
document during the crawl, sync, and index stages, including any errors. If
the report is empty for an in-progress job, check back later as data is
emitted to the report as events occur during the sync process.
