# Uploading files
<a name="upload-docs"></a>

To upload documents directly to an Amazon Q Business application environment, you can use the AWS Management Console or the [BatchPutDocument](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_BatchPutDocument.html) API operation.

If you use an Amazon Kendra index to retrieve your documents, you can't directly upload documents.

**Note**
This procedure is available if you chose to create a new Amazon Q Business index for your application environment. Files can only be uploaded after the Amazon Q Business index and retriever creation process has completed.

The following tabs provide a procedure for the AWS Management Console and code examples for the AWS CLI.
