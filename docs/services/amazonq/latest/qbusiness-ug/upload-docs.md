# Uploading files

To upload documents directly to an Amazon Q Business application environment, you can use
the AWS Management Console or the [BatchPutDocument](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_BatchPutDocument.html) API operation.

If you use an Amazon Kendra index to retrieve your documents, you can't directly
upload documents.

###### Note

This procedure is available if you chose to create a new Amazon Q Business index for your
application environment. Files can only be uploaded after the Amazon Q Business index
and retriever creation process has completed.

The following tabs provide a procedure for the AWS Management Console and code examples for the
AWS CLI.

Console

**To upload files**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business
    console.

2. Complete the steps to create your Amazon Q Business
    application.

3. Complete the steps for [creating an Amazon Q Business\
    index](select-retriever.md#native-retriever).

4. Then, from the left navigation menu, choose **Data**
**sources**.

5. From the **Data sources** page, choose
    **Add data source**.

6. Then, on the **Add data sources** page, from
    **Data sources** choose **Upload**
**files**.

7. Then, in **Upload files**, select one of the
    following methods to add your files:

- Drag and drop the document files that you want to
upload.

- Add your documents to the application environment, and then select
**Choose files**.

8. After choosing your files, choose
    **Upload**.

You are returned to the Amazon Q Business console while your
    documents are uploaded. The console displays a confirmation message
    when your documents are successfully uploaded.
