# Creating an Amazon Q Business application using Identity Federation through IAM
<a name="create-application-iam"></a>

This section walks you through creating and configuring an Amazon Q Business application using IAM federation to manage end user access.

Amazon Q Business supports identity federation through AWS Identity and Access Management. When you use identity federation, you can manage users with your enterprise identity provider (IdP) and use AWS Identity and Access Management to authenticate users when they sign in to Amazon Q Business.

You can use any third-party identity provider that supports Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0) or OpenID Connect (OIDC) to provide an onboarding flow for your Amazon Q Business users. Such identity providers include, but aren't limited to Okta and Ping Identity.

**Important**
Amazon Q Business supports Microsoft Entra ID with SAML 2.0, but doesn't support OIDC for Google or Microsoft Entra ID.

With identity federation, your users get one-click access to their Amazon Q Business applications using their existing identity credentials. You also have the security benefit of identity authentication by your identity provider. You can control which users have access to Amazon Q Business using your existing identity provider.

**Note**
Federated groups aren't supported through IAM Federation. If you want to ingest federated groups, use the [PutGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_PutGroup.html) API.
