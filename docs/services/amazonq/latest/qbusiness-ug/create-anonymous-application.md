# Creating an Amazon Q Business application environment for anonymous access

Amazon Q Business application environments support anonymous access, enabling unauthenticated
user interactions with the Amazon Q generative AI assistant. You can also make
selected enterprise data accessible to users without requiring credentials, such as website
visitors seeking product information or support. This can be integrated through:

- Embedding the web experience URL in an iframe for quick deployment

- Using the `Chat`, `ChatSync`, and `PutFeedback`
APIs to build custom interfaces

Billing for anonymous access application environments is based on usage. For more information, see
[Amazon Q Business\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/pricing).

###### Important

**Limitations of anonymous application environments**

- You can create your anonymous application environment using Amazon Q Business
Console, API, SDK, and AWS CLI. You can only use the application environment with the chat
APIs. The following are the only chat APIs that support anonymous access
application environments.

- `Chat`

- `ChatSync`

- `PutFeedback`

- The web experience is only available for preview and testing purposes unless
used within the context of an Amazon Q embedded implementation. For
more information, see [Amazon Q embedded](embed-amazon-q-business.md).

- The GetDocumentContent API is not available for anonymous applications, consistent with other APIs such as GetMedia that require authentication.

- Chat history is not available for anonymous application environments

- Anonymous users and authenticated users are not supported on the same
application environments

- Topic rules using users and groups are not supported for anonymous
application environments

- Plugins are not supported for anonymous application environments

- Amazon Q Apps are not supported for anonymous application environments

- Attachments are not supported for anonymous application environments

- Admin controls and guardrails are read-only for anonymous application environments,
except for [blocked words](guardrails-global-controls.md#guardrails-global-blocked).

- Amazon Q Business integrations are not supported for anonymous
application environments

- The Amazon Q Quick integration is not supported for anonymous
application environments

- You must only ingest publicly available data sources without access control
lists (ACLs). Examples of public data sources include:

- any data from the Amazon Q Business Web Crawler

- S3 data without Amazon Q Business ACLs

All other Amazon Q Business functionality and features remain unchanged.

## Creating an a Amazon Q Business application environment for anonymous access

You can create an Amazon Q Business application environment that can be accessed
anonymously using the Amazon Q Business Console, API, SDK, and AWS CLI. As a
prerequisite, you must complete the [setting up](setting-up.md) tasks. If
you're using the AWS CLI or the API, you must create the required [IAM\
roles](setting-up.md).

The following tabs provide a procedure for creating your Amazon Q Business
application environment with anonymous access using the Amazon Q Business console; and an
example using the AWS CLI.

Console

**To create an anonymous access**
**application environment**

1. Sign in to the Amazon Q Business console.

2. On the **Create application environment** page, for
    **What kind of application environment do you want to**
**create?**, enter the following information for your
    Amazon Q Business application environment:
1. **Application name** – A name for
       your Amazon Q Business application environment for easy
       identification. This name is only visible in the AWS Management Console.
       The name can include hyphens (-), but not spaces, and can
       have a maximum of 1,000 alphanumeric characters. Amazon Q Business auto-generates an application environment name for
       you, unless you choose to enter a custom name.

2. **User Access** – Choose
       **Anonymous access**, users can then
       access this application environment without authentication.

      ###### Note

      The web experience is only available for preview and
      testing purposes _unless_ used within
      the context of an Amazon Q embedded
      implementation. For more information, see [Amazon Q embedded](embed-amazon-q-business.md). If you want
      this capability, choose **Web**
      **experience**
3. For application environments with **Anonymous access**, you
    will be billed using usage based billing. For more information, see
    [Amazon Q Business pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/pricing).

4. For **Application details** – Amazon Q Business chooses the following configuration settings for
    your application environment by default:
1. For **Application service access**
       – Amazon Q Business will create a new
       service-linked role for your application environment.

2. **Encryption** – Amazon Q Business will create an AWS owned AWS KMS key to
       encrypt your data.
5. (Optional) To customize **Application details**,
    expand the **Application details section**, and
    then do the following:
1. In **Application service access**, for
       **Choose a method to authorize Amazon Q Business**, choose from the
       following options:
      1. **Create and use a new service-linked role**
         **(SLR)** – Create and use a new
          Amazon Q Business-managed IAM role to
          allow it to access the AWS resources
          it needs to create your application environment.

      2. **Create and use a new service role**
         **(SR)** – Create and use a new
          IAM role for Amazon Q Business to allow it to access the AWS
          resources it needs to create your
          application environment.

      3. **Use an existing service role**
         **(SR)/service-linked role (SLR)** –
          Use an existing service role or service-linked
          IAM role to allow Amazon Q Business to access the AWS
          resources it needs to create your
          application environment.

         ###### Note

         For more information about example service
         roles, see [IAM role for an Amazon Q Business application](create-application-iam-role.md). For
         information on service-linked roles, including to
         manage them, see [Using service-linked\
         roles](../business-use-dg/using-service-linked-roles.md).

      4. **Service role name** – A
          name for the service (IAM) role you
          created for easy identification on the
          console.
2. For **Encryption** – Amazon Q Business encrypts your data by default using
       AWS managed AWS KMS keys. To customize your
       encryption settings, select **Customize encryption**
      **settings (advanced)**. Then, you can choose to
       use an existing AWS KMS key or create a new
       one.
6. For **Web experience service settings**, consider
    the following.
1. **If you will use the web experience feature,**
      **choose a method to authorize Amazon Q Business** – A service access role assumed by
       your web experience that grants permission to have
       conversations anonymously. You can choose to use an existing
       role or create a new role.

2. **Service role name** – A name for
       the service role you created for easy identification on the
       console.
7. To start creating your application environment, choose
    **Create**.

AWS CLI

**To configure an Amazon Q Business**
**application environment for anonymous access**

```nohighlight

aws qbusiness create-application \
--region your-region
--display-name application-name \
--identity-type ANONYMOUS \
