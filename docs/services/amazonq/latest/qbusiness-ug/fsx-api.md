# Connecting Amazon Q Business to Amazon FSx (Windows) using APIs
<a name="fsx-api"></a>

You use the [CreateDataSource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_CreateDataSource.html) action to connect a data source to your Amazon Q application. You can also use the [UpdateDataSource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_UpdateDataSource.html) action to modify an existing data source configuration.

Then, you use the `configuration` parameter to provide a JSON blob that conforms the AWS-defined JSON schema.

For an example of the API request, see [CreateDataSource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_CreateDataSource.html) and [UpdateDataSource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_UpdateDataSource.html) in the Amazon Q API Reference.

The following table provides information about important JSON keys to configure.

| Configuration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| connectionConfiguration | Configuration information for the endpoint for the data source. |
| repositoryEndpointMetadata | The endpoint information for the data source. |
| fileSystemId | The identifier of the Amazon FSx (Windows) file system. You can find your file system ID on the File Systems dashboard in the Amazon FSx (Windows) console. |
| fileSystemType | The type of Amazon FSx you use: Amazon FSx (Windows) file system. |
| repositoryConfigurations | Configuration information for the content of the data source. For example, configuring specific types of content and field mappings. |
|  +  `All`   | A list of objects that map the attributes or field names of your Amazon FSx (Windows) pages and assets to Amazon Q index field names. |
| additionalProperties | Additional configuration options for your content in your data source. |
| isCrawlAcl | Specify true to crawl access control information from documents.  Amazon Q Business crawls ACL information by default to ensure responses are generated only from documents your end users have access to. See [Authorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/connector-concepts.html#connector-authorization) for more details.  |
| maxFileSizeInMegaBytes | Specify the maximum single file size limit in MBs that Amazon Q will crawl. Amazon Q will crawl only the files within the size limit you define. The default file size is 50MB. The maximum file size should be greater than 0MB and less than or equal to 50MB. |
|  +  `inclusionPatterns`   | A list of regular expression patterns to include specific content from you Amazon FSx (Windows) data source. Content that match the patterns are included in the index. Content that doesn't match the patterns are excluded from the index. If content matches both an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence, and the content isn't included in the index. |
|  +  `exclusionPatterns`   | A list of regular expression patterns to exclude specific content from your Amazon FSx (Windows) data source. Content that match the patterns are excluded from the index. Content that doesn't match the patterns are included in the index. If content matches both an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence, and the content isn't included in the index. |
| enableIdentityCrawler | true to activate identity crawler. Identity crawler is activated by default. Crawling identity information on users and groups with access to specific documents is useful for user context filtering. Search results are filtered based on the user or their group access to documents.  Amazon Q Business crawls identity information from your data source by default to ensure responses are generated only from documents end users have access to. For more information, see [Identity crawler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/connector-concepts.html#connector-identity-crawler).   |
| syncMode | Specify whether Amazon Q should update your index by syncing all documents or only new, modified, and deleted documents. You can choose between the following options: +  Use `FORCED_FULL_CRAWL` to freshly re-crawl all content and replace existing content each time your data source syncs with your index <br />+  Use `FULL_CRAWL` to incrementally crawl only new, modified, and deleted content each time your data source syncs with your index   |
| type | The type of data source. Specify FSX as your data source type. |
| version | The version of this template that's currently supported. |
