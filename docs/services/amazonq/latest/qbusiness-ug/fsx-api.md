# Connecting Amazon Q Business to Amazon FSx (Windows) using APIs

You use the [CreateDataSource](../api-reference/api-createdatasource.md) action to connect a data source to your
Amazon Q application. You can also use the [UpdateDataSource](../api-reference/api-updatedatasource.md) action to modify an existing data source configuration.

Then, you use the
`configuration` parameter to provide a JSON blob that conforms the AWS-defined JSON schema.

For an example of the API request, see [CreateDataSource](../api-reference/api-createdatasource.md) and [UpdateDataSource](../api-reference/api-updatedatasource.md) in the Amazon Q API Reference.

The following table provides information about important JSON keys to
configure.

ConfigurationDescription`connectionConfiguration`Configuration information for the endpoint for the data
source.`repositoryEndpointMetadata`The endpoint information for the data source.`fileSystemId`The identifier of the Amazon FSx (Windows) file system. You can find
your file system ID on the File Systems dashboard in the
Amazon FSx (Windows) console.`fileSystemType`The type of Amazon FSx you use: Amazon FSx (Windows) file
system.`repositoryConfigurations`Configuration information for the content of the data source. For
example, configuring specific types of content and field
mappings.

- `All`

A list of objects that map the attributes or field names of your
Amazon FSx (Windows) pages and assets to Amazon Q index field
names.`additionalProperties`Additional configuration options for your content in your data
source.`isCrawlAcl`Specify `true` to crawl access control information from
documents.

###### Note

Amazon Q Business crawls ACL information by default to
ensure responses are generated only from documents your end
users have access to. See [Authorization](connector-concepts.md#connector-authorization) for more
details.

`maxFileSizeInMegaBytes`Specify the maximum single file size limit in MBs that Amazon Q will
crawl. Amazon Q will crawl only the files within the size limit you
define. The default file size is 50MB. The maximum file size should be
greater than 0MB and less than or equal to 50MB.

- `inclusionPatterns`

A list of regular expression patterns to include specific content
from you Amazon FSx (Windows) data source. Content that match the patterns
are included in the index. Content that doesn't match the patterns are
excluded from the index. If content matches both an inclusion and
exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence, and the
content isn't included in the index.

- `exclusionPatterns`

A list of regular expression patterns to exclude specific content
from your Amazon FSx (Windows) data source. Content that match the
patterns are excluded from the index. Content that doesn't match the
patterns are included in the index. If content matches both an inclusion
and exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence, and the
content isn't included in the index.`enableIdentityCrawler``true` to activate identity crawler. Identity crawler is
activated by default. Crawling identity information on users and groups
with access to specific documents is useful for user context filtering.
Search results are filtered based on the user or their group access to
documents.

###### Note

Amazon Q Business crawls identity information from your
data source by default to ensure responses are generated only
from documents end users have access to. For more information,
see [Identity crawler](connector-concepts.md#connector-identity-crawler).

`syncMode`Specify whether Amazon Q should update your index by
syncing all documents or only new, modified, and deleted documents. You
can choose between the following options:

- Use `FORCED_FULL_CRAWL` to freshly re-crawl all
content and replace existing content each time your data
source syncs with your index

- Use `FULL_CRAWL` to incrementally crawl only
new, modified, and deleted content each time your data
source syncs with your index

`type`The type of data source. Specify `FSX` as your data source
type.`version`The version of this template that's currently supported.
