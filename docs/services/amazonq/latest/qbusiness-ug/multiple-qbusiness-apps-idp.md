# Connecting multiple Amazon Q Business applications to an Identity Provider

You can connect multiple Amazon Q Business custom applications to a single SAML
2.0 or OIDC based identity provider (IdP) application. Connecting multiple Amazon Q Business applications to a single identity provider enables end users access
Amazon Q Business with all their web-based tools and services through a single
sign-on (SSO) provided by the IdP.

Most IdPs allow you to configure additional custom web applications alongside existing
ones. In this section we use Okta as an example to show you the specific
steps to configure a new custom application.

###### Important

Amazon Q Business supports Microsoft Entra ID with SAML 2.0,
but doesn't support OIDC for Google or Microsoft Entra
ID.

## Using SAML

In this section we use Okta as an example to show you the specific
steps to configure a new custom application using SAML 2.0.

**To connect multiple Amazon Q Business custom**
**applications to Okta**

01. Sign into Okta and go to the admin console.

02. In the left navigation pane, choose **Applications**, and
     then choose your existing SAML 2.0 application.

03. From **General**, choose **SAML**
    **settings**.

04. Keep your **General Settings** as is and select
     **Next**.

05. In **Edit SAML Integration**, for **SAML**
    **Settings**, under **General**, make sure
     you've already entered the **Single sign-on URL** and
     **Audience URI** for your first SAML application. For
     steps on how to do this, see [Create and configure an Okta\
     application](create-application-iam.md#create-iam-app-okta-1).

06. Then, from **General**, select **Show Advanced**
    **Settings**.

07. Scroll down to **Other Requestable SSO URLs** and select
     **Add Another**.

08. Then, add a **Single sign-on URL** for each additional
     SAML application you want to configure, and provide an index value for each.
     Example URL format:
     `http://localhost:8000/saml`.

09. Then, scroll down and select **Next**.

10. On the **Feedback** page, select
     **Finish**.

You're done with setting up your Okta application for multiple
Amazon Q Business applications.

To make a request to this URI, you need to construct a SAML request in the
following format:

```nohighlight

<samlp:AuthnRequest
    xmlns:samlp="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol"
    xmlns:saml="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion"
    ID="_uniqueID12345"
    Version="2.0"
    IssueInstant="2024-08-08T12:00:00Z"
    ProtocolBinding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect"
    Destination="https://idp-sso-url/sso"
    AssertionConsumerServiceIndex="0"
    <saml:Issuer>https://sp.example.com/</saml:Issuer>
    <samlp:NameIDPolicy Format="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified" AllowCreate="true"
</samlp:AuthnRequest>
```

Then, you send a SAML request to your to your custom web application's URI with
index 0. The SAML request is usually sent via HTTP redirect, which requires the XML
to be Base64 encoded. This can be done programmatically in various languages. For
example, in JavaScript, you would do the following:

```

const samlRequest = '<samlp:AuthnRequest ...>...</samlp:AuthnRequest>'; // Your SAML request
const encodedRequest = btoa(samlRequest); // Base64 encoding
```

After encoding, redirect the user to the IdP with the following SAML request as
parameter:

```

window.location.href = `https://idp.example.com/sso?SAMLRequest=$${encodedRequest}`;
```

## Using OIDC

You can configure multiple redirect URLs for a single OpenID Connect (OIDC)
application. In this section we use Okta as an example to show you
the specific steps to configure a new custom application using OIDC.

**To connect multiple Amazon Q Business custom**
**applications to Okta**

1. Sign into Okta and go to the admin console.

2. From **General**, scroll down to **General**
**Settings**, and then select **Edit**.

3. From **LOGIN**, for **Sign-in redirect**
**URIs**, and then select **Edit**.

4. In **Sign-in redirect URIs**, choose **Add**
**URI** to add multiple URIs. Then, select
    **Save**.

You're done with setting up your Okta application for multiple
Amazon Q Business applications.
