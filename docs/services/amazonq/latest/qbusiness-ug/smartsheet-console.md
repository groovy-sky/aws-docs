# Connecting Amazon Q Business to Smartsheet using the console

The following procedure outlines how to connect Amazon Q Business to
Smartsheet using the AWS Management Console.

###### Note

Before you begin adding your data source, make sure you've created an Amazon Q Business application, and added an index and retriever to it.

###### Connecting Amazon Q to Smartsheet

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business
     console.

02. From the left navigation menu, choose **Data**
    **sources**.

03. From the **Data sources** page, choose
     **Add data source**.

04. Then, on the **Add data sources** page, from
     **Data sources**, add the **Smartsheet** data source to your Amazon Q application.

05. Then, on the **Smartsheet** data source page, enter
     the following information:

06. **Name and description**, do the following:

- For **Data source name** – Name your data
source for easy tracking.

###### Note

You can include hyphens (-) but
not spaces. Maximum of 1,000 alphanumeric characters.

- **Description –**
**_optional_** – Add an optional
description for your data source. This text is viewed only by Amazon Q Business administrators and can be edited later.

07. In **User type** – Choose the user type in your
     Smartsheet account. You can choose between **System**
    **Admin** and **Non-System Admin**. System Admins
     can ingest sheets, folders, and workspaces into Amazon Q Business.
     Non-System Admins can ingest only sheets.

08. **Authentication** – Enter the following information
     for your **AWS Secrets Manager secret**.
    1. **Secret name** – A name for your
        secret.

    2. For **Smartsheet API access token** –
        Enter the value for the access token you created in your
        Smartsheet account.
09. **IAM role** – Choose
     an existing IAM role or create an IAM role to access your repository credentials and
     index content.

    ###### Note

    Creating a new service IAM role is recommended.

    For more information, see [IAM role](smartsheet-connector.md#smartsheet-iam).

10. In **Sync scope**, enter the following information:
    1. In **Select specific sheets, folders, and**
       **workspaces**, for **ID type** –
        Select content to sync using a specific **Sheet ID**,
        **Folder ID**, and **Workspace**
       **ID**.

    2. For **Select attachments and conversations**, select
        from the following options:

- **All attachments** – Select to
include all attachments.

- **All conversations** – Select to
include all conversations.

    3. In **Additional configuration –**
       **_optional_, select from the following**
       **options:**

- **Sheet and folder regex patterns** –
Choose to include or exclude specific sheet and folder names
using regex patterns.

- **Attachment regex patterns** – Choose
to include or exclude specific files by name and type using
regex patterns.

    4. For **Maximum file size** – Specify the file
        size limit in MBs that Amazon Q will crawl. Amazon Q will crawl only
        the files within the size limit you define. The default file size is
        50MB. The maximum file size should be greater than 0MB and less than or
        equal to 50MB.

    5. **Multi-media content configuration – optional** –
        To enable content extraction from embedded images and visuals in documents, choose **Visual content in documents**.

       To extract audio transcriptions and video content, enable processing for the following file types:

    6. **Advanced settings**

       **Document deletion safeguard** \- _optional_–To safeguard
        your documents from deletion during a sync job, select **On** and enter an integer between 0 - 100. If
        the percentage of documents to be deleted in your sync job exceeds the percentage you selected, the
        delete phase will be skipped and no documents from this data source will be deleted from your index. For more information, see
        [Document deletion safeguard](connector-concepts.md#document-deletion-safeguard).
11. For **Sync mode**, choose how you want to update your index
     when your data source content changes. When you sync your data source with
     Amazon Q for the first time, all content is synced by
     default.

- **Full sync**—Sync all content regardless of
the previous sync status.

- **New, modified, or deleted content**
**sync**—Sync only new, modified, and deleted
documents.

12. In **Sync run schedule**, for **Frequency**
     – Choose how often Amazon Q will sync with your data source.
     For more details, see [Sync run schedule](connector-concepts.md#connector-sync-run).

    ###### Note

    The Amazon Q Business Smartsheet connector doesn't support
    hourly syncs. For optimal performance, choose to sync your data during a
    time window outside of 11am UTC to 11pm UTC.

13. **Tags - _optional_** –
     Add tags to search and filter your resources or track your AWS costs. See [Tags](tagging.md) for more details.

14. **Field mappings** – A list of data source document
     attributes to map to your index fields. Add the fields from the **Data**
    **source details** page after you finish adding your data source.

     You can choose from two types of fields:

    1. **Default** – Automatically created by Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data
        source. You can't edit these.

    2. **Custom** – Automatically created by Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data
        source. You can edit these. You can also create and add new custom
        fields.

       ###### Note

       Support for adding custom fields varies by connector. You
       won't see the **Add field** option if your
       connector doesn't support adding custom fields.

For more information, see [Field mappings](connector-concepts.md#connector-field-mappings).

15. In **Data source details**, choose **Sync**
    **now** to allow Amazon Q to begin syncing (crawling and
     ingesting) data from your data source. When the sync job finishes, your data
     source is ready to use.

    ###### Note

    View CloudWatch logs for your data source sync job by selecting **View**
    **CloudWatch logs**. If you encounter a `Resource not found
                                exception` error, wait and try again as logs may not be available
    immediately.

    You can also view a detailed document-level report by selecting
    **View Report**. This report shows the status of each
    document during the crawl, sync, and index stages, including any errors. If
    the report is empty for an in-progress job, check back later as data is
    emitted to the report as events occur during the sync process.

    For more information, see [Troubleshooting data source\
    connectors](troubleshooting-data-sources.md#troubleshooting-data-sources-not-indexed).
