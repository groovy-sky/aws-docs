# Known limitations for the Google Calendar connector (Preview)
<a name="gcal-limitations"></a>

The connector employs a rolling window approach for indexing data. This rolling window mechanism spans a total of six months, with four months of historical data and two months of future data. As the connector syncs and ingests new data, the oldest data that falls beyond the four-month historical window is automatically purged from the index. Simultaneously, new data for the upcoming two months is added to the index, allowing for future data visibility and analysis.
