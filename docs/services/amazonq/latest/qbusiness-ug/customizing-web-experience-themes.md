# Customizing visual themes
<a name="customizing-web-experience-themes"></a>

This topic shows how to customize the visual theme using the Amazon Q Business console and the AWS CLI.

**Note**
The console only supports accessing customization artifacts stored in Amazon S3 but the Amazon Q Business API supports accessing artifacts in both S3 and other data sources.
Your web customization artifacts must be of one of the following supported content types.
Custom logo and favicons — `image/svg+xml`, `image/x-icon`, and `image/png`. Logo files must be 1 MB or smaller.
Custom fonts — `font/ttf`, `font/otf`, `font/woff`, and `font/woff2`.

## Prerequisites for accessing your customization artifacts stored in Amazon S3
<a name="customizing-web-experience-themes-requirements"></a>

1. All S3 URIs for files to read and folders to store must be located in the same AWS Region as the application environment of the web experience.

1. You can use public or private Amazon S3 buckets to save and store your web experience customization.
   +

**Prerequisites for public S3 buckets**
     + Ensure all S3 URIs for files to read and folders to store are publicly accessible. For managing access to your S3 files, see [Access Control in Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-management.html).
     + Configure CORS to allow console and web app access to resources. For more information, see [Configuring cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/enabling-cors-examples.html).
   + **Prerequisites for private S3 buckets**

     To allow Amazon Q Business to access web customization artifacts from your private S3 buckets, you must do the following:
     + Disable [access control lists (ACLs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html). For more information, see [Setting Object Ownership on an existing bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-ownership-existing-bucket.html).
     + If your Amazon S3 bucket is encrypted using AWS KMS Key instead of Amazon S3 managed key, a similar resource policy to the sample bucket policy below must be added to AWS KMS key.

           }]
       }
       ```

------
     + Create a bucket policy in your private bucket.
**Note**
 The value of "`aws:Referer"` cannot contain `"https://"` or end with `"/"`.
