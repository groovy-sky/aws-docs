# Connecting Amazon Q custom connector to Amazon Q Business

Use a custom data source when you have a repository that Amazon Q Business doesn’t
yet provide a data source connector for. When you create a custom data source, you have
complete control over how the documents to index are selected. Amazon Q only
provides metric information that you can use to monitor your data source sync jobs. You must
create and run the crawler that determines the documents your data source indexes.

**You can use a custom data source connector to:**

- See the same run history metrics that Amazon Q data sources provide
even when you can't use Amazon Q data sources to sync your
repositories.

- Create a consistent sync monitoring experience between Amazon Q data
sources and custom data sources.

- See sync metrics for a data source connector that you created using the [BatchPutDocument](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_BatchPutDocument.html) and [BatchDeleteDocument](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_BatchDeleteDocument.html) API operations.

You can create an Amazon Q custom data source connector using either the
AWS Management Console or the [CreateDataSource](../api-reference/api-createdatasource.md).

**When you create a custom data source using the**
**`CreateDataSource` API operation:**

- The action returns an ID to use when you synchronize the data source.

- You only need to provide a `Name` and optionally a `Description`.

- Set the `Configuration` parameter as follows:

```json

"configuration": {
"type": "CUSTOM",
"version": "1.0.0"
}
```

- When indexing documents later, you must specify the main title of your documents using the [Document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_Document.html) object, and `_source_uri` in [DocumentAttribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_DocumentAttribute.html). The main title is
required so that `DocumentTitle` and `DocumentURI` are
included in the [ChatSync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_ChatSync.html) or [Chat](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_Chat.html) response.

**When you create a custom data source using the**
**console:**

- The console returns an ID to use when you synchronize the data source.

- Give your data source a name, and optionally a description and resource
tags.

- After the data source is created, a data source ID is shown. Copy this ID to use
when you synchronize the data source with the index.
