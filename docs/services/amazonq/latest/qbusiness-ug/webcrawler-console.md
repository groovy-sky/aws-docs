# Connecting Amazon Q Business to Web Crawler using the console

The following procedure outlines how to connect Amazon Q Business to
Web Crawler using the AWS Management Console.

###### Note

Before you begin adding your data source, make sure you've created an Amazon Q Business application, and added an index and retriever to it.

###### Connecting Amazon Q to Web Crawler

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business
     console.

02. From the left navigation menu, choose **Data**
    **sources**.

03. From the **Data sources** page, choose
     **Add data source**.

04. Then, on the **Add data sources** page, from
     **Data sources**, add the **Web Crawler** data source to your Amazon Q application.

05. Then, on the **Web Crawler** data source page, enter
     the following information:

06. **Name and description**, do the following:

- For **Data source name** – Name your data
source for easy tracking.

###### Note

You can include hyphens (-) but
not spaces. Maximum of 1,000 alphanumeric characters.

- **Description –**
**_optional_** – Add an optional
description for your data source. This text is viewed only by Amazon Q Business administrators and can be edited later.

07. In **Source** choose from the following options:

- **Source URLs** – Add up to 10 seed/starting
point URLs of the websites you want to crawl. You can also include
website subdomains.

- **Source sitemaps** – Add up to 3 sitemap URLs
of the websites you want to crawl.

- **Source URLs file** – Add up to 100
seed/starting point URLs listed in a text file in Amazon S3.
Each URL should be on a separate line in the text file.

- **Source sitemaps file** – Add up to 3 sitemap
XML files stored in Amazon S3. You can also zip the XML
files.

###### Note

If you choose to use a text file that includes a list of up to 100 seed
URLs or to use a sitemap XML file, you specify the path to the Amazon S3 bucket where your file is stored.

You can also combine multiple sitemap XML files into a .zip file.
Otherwise, you can manually enter up to 10 seed or starting point URLs, and
up to three sitemap URLs.

###### Note

If you want to crawl a sitemap, check that the base or root URL is the
same as the URLs listed on your sitemap page. For example, if your sitemap
URL is
_https://example.com/sitemap-page.html_,
the URLs listed on this sitemap page should also use the base URL
"https://example.com/".

###### Note

If you want to later edit your data source to change your seed URLs with
authentication to sitemaps, you must create a new data source.

Amazon Q configures the data source using the seed URLs
endpoint information in the Secrets Manager secret for authentication.
Therefore, Amazon Q can't reconfigure the data source when
changing to sitemaps.

08. In **Authentication**, choose the type of authentication you
     want to use and enter the following information in your AWS
     Secrets Manager secret:

- **No authentication** – Choose to crawl a
public website without any authentication.

- **Basic authentication** – Enter a name for
the secret, and the username and password you use to access the website
you want to crawl.

- **NTLM/Kerberos authentication** – Enter a
name for the secret, and the username and password you use to access the
website you want to crawl. NTLM authentication protocol includes
password hashing, and Kerberos authentication protocol includes password
encryption.

- **Form authentication** – Enter a name for the
secret, and the username and password you use to access the website you
want to crawl. Also add the following values:

- **User name field Xpath** – Enter the
XPath for your user name field. For example,
`//input[@id='username']`.

- **Password field Xpath** – Enter the
XPath for your password field. For example,
`//input[@id='password']`.

- **User name button Xpath –**
**_Optional_** –
Provide the XPath for the button associated with the username
input field, typically found on a login page. For example,
`//button[@id='login-submit']`. This XPath helps
the automation script identify and interact with the button to
proceed with the login process. You can find this XPath using
your browser’s developer tools.

- **Password button Xpath** – Provide
the XPath for the button associated with the password input
field, typically used to submit the login form. For example,
`//button[@id='login-submit']`. This XPath is
essential for automating the interaction with the button after
the password has been entered. You can find this XPath using
your browser’s developer tools.

###### Note

You can find the XPaths (XML Path Language) of elements using your
web browser's developer tools. XPaths usually follow this format:
`//tagname[@Attribute='Value']`. To learn how to
retrieve XPaths, see [Retrieving XPaths (XML Path Language) for\
Web Crawler](webcrawler-retrieving-credentials.md).

- **SAML authentication** – Enter a name for the
secret, and the username and password you use to access the website you
want to crawl. Also add the following values:

- **User name field Xpath** – Enter the
XPath for your user name field. For example,
`//input[@id='username']`.

- **Password field Xpath** – Enter the
XPath for your password field. For example,
`//input[@id='password']`.

- **User name button Xpath –**
**_Optional_** –
Provide the XPath for the button associated with the username
input field, typically found on a login page. For example,
`//button[@id='login-submit']`. This XPath helps
the automation script identify and interact with the button to
proceed with the login process. You can find this XPath using
your browser’s developer tools.

- **Password button Xpath** – Provide
the XPath for the button associated with the password input
field, typically used to submit the login form. For example,
`//button[@id='login-submit']`. This XPath is
essential for automating the interaction with the button after
the password has been entered. You can find this XPath using
your browser’s developer tools.

###### Note

You can find the XPaths (XML Path Language) of elements using your
web browser's developer tools. XPaths usually follow this format:
`//tagname[@Attribute='Value']`. To learn how to
retrieve XPaths, see [Retrieving XPaths (XML Path Language) for\
Web Crawler](webcrawler-retrieving-credentials.md).

09. **Web proxy – _optional_** –
     Enter the host name and the port number of the proxy server that you want to use
     to connect to internal websites. For example, the host name of
     _https://a.example.com/page1.html_ is
     "a.example.com" and the port number is 443, the standard port
     for HTTPS. If web proxy credentials are required to connect to a website host,
     you can create an AWS Secrets Manager secret that stores the following
     credentials: the username and password required for the web proxy to log into
     the host URL.

10. **Configure VPC and security group –**
    **_optional_** – Choose
     whether you want to use a VPC. If you do, enter the following
     information:

    1. **Subnets** – Select up to 6
        repository subnets that define the subnets and IP ranges
        the repository instance uses in the selected VPC.

    2. **VPC security groups** –
        Choose up to 10 security groups that allow access to
        your data source. Ensure that the security group allows
        incoming traffic from Amazon EC2 instances and
        devices outside your VPC. For databases, security group
        instances are required.

For more information, see [VPC](connector-concepts.md#connector-vpc).

11. **IAM role** – Choose
     an existing IAM role or create an IAM role to access your repository credentials and
     index content.

    ###### Note

    Creating a new service IAM role is recommended.

    For more information, see [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/webcrawler-connector.html#webcrawler-iam).

12. In **Sync scope**, enter the following information:
    1. **Sync domain range** – Choose whether to sync
        website domains with subdomains only, or also crawl other domains that
        the webpages link to ( **Sync everything**). By default,
        Amazon Q only syncs the domains of the websites that you
        want to crawl.

    2. For **Maximum file size** – Specify the file
        size limit in MBs that Amazon Q will crawl. Amazon Q will crawl only
        the files within the size limit you define. The default file size is
        50MB. The maximum file size should be greater than 0MB and less than or
        equal to 50MB.

    3. In **Additional configuration –**
       **_optional_** – Configure the
        following settings:

- **Scope settings**, choose from the
following:

- **Crawl depth** – The depth,
or number, of levels from the seed level to crawl. For
example, the seed URL page is depth 0 and any hyperlinks
on this page that are also crawled are depth 1.

- **Maximum links per page** –
The maximum number of URLs on a single webpage to
crawl.

- **Maximum throttling** – The
maximum number of URLs crawled per website host per
minute.

- **Include files that web pages link to**
– Select this option to allow Amazon Q Business to
crawl and index files that are linked from webpages.

- **Crawl URL patterns** – Add regular
expression patterns to specify which URLs should be included or
excluded during the crawling process. This allows you to control
which pages on a website are crawled and which hyperlinks on
those pages are indexed.

- **URL pattern to index** – Add regular
expression patterns to define which URLs or files should be
included or excluded from indexing. This helps you focus the
indexing process on specific URLs or files, ensuring that only
the desired content is indexed.

    4. **Multi-media content configuration – optional** –
        To enable content extraction from embedded images and visuals in documents, choose **Visual content in documents**.

       To extract audio transcriptions and video content, enable processing for the following file types:

    5. **Advanced settings**

       **Document deletion safeguard** \- _optional_–To safeguard
        your documents from deletion during a sync job, select **On** and enter an integer between 0 - 100. If
        the percentage of documents to be deleted in your sync job exceeds the percentage you selected, the
        delete phase will be skipped and no documents from this data source will be deleted from your index. For more information, see
        [Document deletion safeguard](connector-concepts.md#document-deletion-safeguard).
13. In **Sync mode**, choose how you want to update your index
     when your data source content changes. When you sync your data source with
     Amazon Q for the first time, all content is synced by
     default.

- **Full sync** – Sync all content regardless of
the previous sync status.

- **New, modified, or deleted content sync** –
Sync only new, modified, and deleted documents.

14. In **Sync run schedule**, for
     **Frequency** – Choose how often
     Amazon Q will sync with your data
     source. For more details, see [Sync run schedule](connector-concepts.md#connector-sync-run). To learn how to start a data sync job,
     see [Starting data source connector sync jobs](supported-datasource-actions.md#start-datasource-sync-jobs).

15. **Tags - _optional_** –
     Add tags to search and filter your resources or track your AWS costs. See [Tags](tagging.md) for more details.

16. **Field mappings** – A list of data source document
     attributes to map to your index fields.

    ###### Note

    Add or update the fields from the **Data**
    **source details** page after you finish adding your data source.

    You can choose from two types of fields:

    1. **Default** – Automatically created by
        Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
        can't edit these.

    2. **Custom** – Automatically created by
        Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
        can edit these. You can also create and add new custom fields.

       ###### Note

       Support for adding custom fields varies by connector. You
       won't see the **Add field** option if your
       connector doesn't support adding custom fields.

For more information, see [Field mappings](connector-concepts.md#connector-field-mappings).

17. In **Data source details**, choose **Sync**
    **now** to allow Amazon Q to begin syncing (crawling and
     ingesting) data from your data source. When the sync job finishes, your data
     source is ready to use.

    ###### Note

    View CloudWatch logs for your data source sync job by selecting **View**
    **CloudWatch logs**. If you encounter a `Resource not found
                                exception` error, wait and try again as logs may not be available
    immediately.

    You can also view a detailed document-level report by selecting
    **View Report**. This report shows the status of each
    document during the crawl, sync, and index stages, including any errors. If
    the report is empty for an in-progress job, check back later as data is
    emitted to the report as events occur during the sync process.

    For more information, see [Troubleshooting data source\
    connectors](troubleshooting-data-sources.md#troubleshooting-data-sources-not-indexed).
