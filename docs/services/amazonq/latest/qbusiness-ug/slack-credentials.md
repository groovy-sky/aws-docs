     account](https://slack.com/signin) and sign into your Slack workspace.

    ###### Note

    admin user in the Slack account.

02. From the workspace menu, select **Tools and settings** and
     then select **Manage apps**.

08. On the **OAuth & Permissions** page, go to
     **Scopes**, and then do the following based on whether you
     want to use a Bot Token to connect Slack to Amazon Q, or
     a User Token:

    ###### Important

    If you use the bot token as part of your Slack credentials,
    you cannot index direct messages and group messages, and you must add the
    bot token to the channel you want to index. For information on
    Slack token types, see [Token\
    types](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types) in Slack API.

- Add the following **Bot Token Scopes**:
