# Managing user subscriptions for IAM Identity Center-integrated applications

To manage user subscriptions added to an application environment, you can perform the
following actions:

###### Actions

- [Updating user subscriptions](#update-user-subscriptions)

- [Canceling user or group subscriptions](#delete-user-subscriptions)

- [Listing user subscriptions](#list-user-subscriptions)

## Updating user subscriptions

To update a subscription in an Amazon Q Business application, you can
use either the AWS Management Console or the [UpdateSubscription](../api-reference/api-updatesubscription.md) API
operation.

For more information on user subscriptions for an IAM Identity Center-integrated Amazon Q Business application, see [Subscriptions for applications using\
IAM Identity Center](tiers.md#managing-sub-tiers-sso).

Console

**To update user or group subscription**
**tier**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business console.

2. In **Applications**, select the name of
    the application environment you created.

3. From your applications page, from the **User**
**access** section, select **Manage user**
**access**.

4. From **Manage access and subscriptions**
    select the subscription you want to update. Then, select
    **Edit subscription**.

5. In the **Confirm subscription change**
    dialog box that opens, from the **New**
**subscription** dropdown select **Q**
**Business Lite** or **Q Business**
**Pro**.

6. Then, select **Confirm**. You will see
    the subscription status notification change next to the user
    you've added the subscription to.

7. Then, select **Confirm** to save your
    changes.

AWS CLI

**To update user or group subscription**
**tier**

```nohighlight

aws qbusiness update-subscription \
--application-id application-id \
--subscription-id subscription-id \
--type subscription-type
```

## Canceling user or group subscriptions

To cancel subscriptions, you can use the AWS Management Console or the [CancelSubscription](../api-reference/api-cancelsubscription.md) API
operation.

When you unsubscribe and remove a user or group, it unsubscribes them from the
application environment and removes them from the user list.

For more information on user subscriptions for an IAM Identity Center-integrated Amazon Q Business application, see [Subscriptions for applications using\
IAM Identity Center](tiers.md#managing-sub-tiers-sso).

Console

**To unsubscribe a user or group from an**
**Amazon Q Business application environment**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business console.

2. In **Applications**, select the name of
    the application environment you created.

3. From your applications page, from the **User**
**access** section, select **Manage user**
**access**.

4. From **Manage access and subscriptions**
    select the user or group subscription you want to update.
    Then, select **Remove and**
**unsubscribe**.

5. Then, from the **Unsubscribe and remove**
    dialog box, **Confirm**.

6. Then, select **Confirm** to save your
    changes.

This step cancels subscriptions for the selected users and
    groups and also removes them from your Amazon Q Business application environment.

###### Note

To stop subscription charges for a user, ensure you
have unsubscribed that user from all Amazon Q Business application environments and Quick
instances. For instructions on how to unsubscribe a user
from Quick, see [Unsubscribing from Quick Q](../../../quicksight/latest/user/quicksight-q-unsubscribe.md) in the Quick User
Guide.

To stop charges for an Amazon Q Business index,
you must delete either your Amazon Q Business
index or [delete your Amazon Q Business application environment](supported-app-actions.md#delete-app). If you use
the console, deleting your application environment is the only way
to delete an index associated with it.

AWS CLI

**To cancel user or group subscriptions to**
**Amazon Q Business**

```nohighlight

aws qbusiness cancel-subscription \
--application-id application-id \
--subscription-id subscription-id \
--type subscription-type
```

## Listing user subscriptions

To see a list of user and group subscriptions within a specific Amazon Q Business
application, you can use the AWS Management Console or the [ListSubscriptions](../api-reference/api-listsubscriptions.md) API
operation.

For a consolidated view of your user subscriptions—including a list of
subscribed users, their subscription status, and applications, accounts, or
services a user can access through their subscriptions—you can also view
the [Amazon Q\
subscriptions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/subscriptions).

3. From your applications page, from the **User**
**access** section, select **Manage user**
**access**.

4. In the **Manage access and**
**subscriptions** select
    **Users** if you want to view user
    subscriptions or **Groups** if you want to
    list group subscriptions.

**To view a consolidated list of all user**
**and group subscriptions across all Amazon Q Business**
**application environments**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q
    console.

2. From the left navigation menu, choose
    **Subscriptions**,and then select
