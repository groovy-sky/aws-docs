# Connecting Amazon Q Business to Salesforce Online using the console

The following procedure outlines how to connect Amazon Q Business to
Salesforce Online using the AWS Management Console.

###### Connecting Amazon Q to Salesforce Online

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business
     console.

02. From the left navigation menu, choose **Data**
    **sources**.

03. From the **Data sources** page, choose
     **Add data source**.

04. Then, on the **Add data sources** page, from
     **Data sources**, add the **Salesforce Online** data source to your Amazon Q application.

05. Then, on the **Salesforce Online** data source page, enter
     the following information:

06. **Name and description**, do the following:

- For **Data source name** – Name your data
source for easy tracking.

###### Note

You can include hyphens (-) but
not spaces. Maximum of 1,000 alphanumeric characters.

- **Description –**
**_optional_** – Add an optional
description for your data source. This text is viewed only by Amazon Q Business administrators and can be edited later.

07. In **Source**, enter the following information:

- **Salesforce URL** – Enter your
Salesforce server URL. For example,
`https://mysite.salesforce.com`.

08. **Authorization** – Amazon Q Business crawls ACL information by default to ensure responses are generated only from
     documents your end users have access to. If supported for your connector, you can manage ACLs by selecting **Enable ACLs** to enable ACLs or **Disable ACLs** to disable them.
     To manage ACLs, you need specific IAM permissions. See [Grant permission to create data sources with ACLs disabled](setting-up.md#DisableAclOnDataSource) for more details.

     See [Authorization](connector-concepts.md#connector-authorization) for more details.

09. **Authentication** – Enter the following information for your
     **AWS Secrets Manager secret**.
    1. **Secret name** – A name for your secret.

    2. For **Username**, **Password**,
        **Security token**, **Consumer key**,
        **Consumer secret**, and **Authentication URL**
        – Enter the authentication credential values that you created in your
        Salesforce account.

       ###### Note

       If you use Salesforce Online Developer Edition, use
       `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token` or the My Domain
       login URL (for example, `
                         https://MyCompany.my.salesforce.com`) as the **Authentication**
       **URL**. If you use Salesforce Online Sandbox Edition, use
       `https://test.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token ` or the My Domain
       login URL (for example, `
                         MyDomainName--SandboxName.sandbox.my.salesforce.com`) as the
       **Authentication URL**.

    3. Choose **Save and add secret**.
10. **Configure VPC and security group –**
    **_optional_** – Choose
     whether you want to use a VPC. If you do, enter the following
     information:

    1. **Subnets** – Select up to 6
        repository subnets that define the subnets and IP ranges
        the repository instance uses in the selected VPC.

    2. **VPC security groups** –
        Choose up to 10 security groups that allow access to
        your data source. Ensure that the security group allows
        incoming traffic from Amazon EC2 instances and
        devices outside your VPC. For databases, security group
        instances are required.

For more information, see [VPC](connector-concepts.md#connector-vpc).

11. **IAM role** – Choose
     an existing IAM role or create an IAM role to access your repository credentials and
     index content.

    ###### Note

    Creating a new service IAM role is recommended.

    For more information, see [IAM role](salesforce-connector.md#salesforce-iam).

12. **Sync scope** – Set the content that you want to sync.
    1. For **Standard objects**, **Standard objects with**
       **attachments**, **Standard objects without attachments**,
        and **Knowledge articles** – Select Salesforce
        entities or content types you want to crawl.

       ###### Note

       You must provide configuration information for indexing at least one of standard
       objects, knowledge articles, or chatter feeds. If you choose to crawl
       **Knowledge articles** you must specify the types of knowledge
       articles to index, the name of the articles, and whether to index the standard
       fields of all knowledge articles or only the fields of a custom article type. If you
       choose to index custom articles, you must specify the internal name of the article
       type. You can specify up to 10 article types.

    2. For **Custom objects** – Add custom object names. You can
        choose to include custom object attachments as well.

    3. **Multi-media content configuration – optional** –
        To enable content extraction from embedded images and visuals in documents, choose **Visual content in documents**.

       To extract audio transcriptions and video content, enable processing for the following file types:

    4. **Advanced settings**

       **Document deletion safeguard** \- _optional_–To safeguard
        your documents from deletion during a sync job, select **On** and enter an integer between 0 - 100. If
        the percentage of documents to be deleted in your sync job exceeds the percentage you selected, the
        delete phase will be skipped and no documents from this data source will be deleted from your index. For more information, see
        [Document deletion safeguard](connector-concepts.md#document-deletion-safeguard).
13. For **Maximum file size** – Specify the file size limit in MBs
     that Amazon Q will crawl. Amazon Q will crawl only the files within the size limit you
     define. The default file size is 50MB. The maximum file size should be greater than 0MB
     and less than or equal to 50MB.

14. In **Additional configuration –**
    **_optional_**:

- For **Entity regex patterns** and **Attachment regex**
**patterns** – Add regular expression patterns to include or exclude
certain files. You can add up to 100 patterns.

15. In **Sync mode**, choose how you
     want to update your index when your data source
     content changes. When you sync your data source with
     Amazon Q for the first time, all content
     is synced by default.

- **Full sync** – Sync
all content regardless of the previous sync
status.

- **New or modified content**
**sync** – Sync only new and modified
documents.

- **New, modified, or deleted**
**content sync** – Sync only new,
modified, and deleted documents.

For more details, see [Sync mode](connector-concepts.md#connector-sync-mode).

16. In **Sync run schedule**, for
     **Frequency** – Choose how often
     Amazon Q will sync with your data
     source. For more details, see [Sync run schedule](connector-concepts.md#connector-sync-run). To learn how to start a data sync job,
     see [Starting data source connector sync jobs](supported-datasource-actions.md#start-datasource-sync-jobs).

17. **Tags - _optional_** –
     Add tags to search and filter your resources or track your AWS costs. See [Tags](tagging.md) for more details.

18. **Field mappings** – A list of data source document
     attributes to map to your index fields.

    ###### Note

    Add or update the fields from the **Data**
    **source details** page after you finish adding your data source.

    You can choose from two types of fields:

    1. **Default** – Automatically created by
        Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
        can't edit these.

    2. **Custom** – Automatically created by
        Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
        can edit these. You can also create and add new custom fields.

       ###### Note

       Support for adding custom fields varies by connector. You
       won't see the **Add field** option if your
       connector doesn't support adding custom fields.

For more information, see [Field mappings](connector-concepts.md#connector-field-mappings).

19. In **Data source details**, choose **Sync**
    **now** to allow Amazon Q to begin syncing (crawling and
     ingesting) data from your data source. When the sync job finishes, your data
     source is ready to use.

    ###### Note

    View CloudWatch logs for your data source sync job by selecting **View**
    **CloudWatch logs**. If you encounter a `Resource not found
                                exception` error, wait and try again as logs may not be available
    immediately.

    You can also view a detailed document-level report by selecting
    **View Report**. This report shows the status of each
    document during the crawl, sync, and index stages, including any errors. If
    the report is empty for an in-progress job, check back later as data is
    emitted to the report as events occur during the sync process.

    For more information, see [Troubleshooting data source\
    connectors](troubleshooting-data-sources.md#troubleshooting-data-sources-not-indexed).
