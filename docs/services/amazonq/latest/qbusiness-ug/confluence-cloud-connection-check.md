Before you sync your Confluence (Cloud) data source connector after [configuring it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/confluence-cloud-console.html), we recommend you check the connection between Amazon Q Business and Confluence (Cloud). The following are the cURL commands you need to check Confluence (Cloud) connectivity.

## Checking basic authentication connectivity
<a name="confluence-cloud-connection-check-basic"></a>

To check connectivity for a Confluence (Cloud) data source connector using basic authentication, use the following cURL command:

```
curl --location '{{https://<confluence_host-url>/wiki/rest/api/user/current}}'
--header 'Authorization: Basic <{{base64(email:api_token)}}>'
```

If your data source is connected as expected, the JSON response should resemble the following:

```
{
    "type": "known",
    "accountId": "{{accountId}}",
    "accountType": "atlassian",
    "email": "{{email}}",
    "publicName": "Administrator",
    "profilePicture": {
        "path": "{{/wiki/aa-avatar/<accountId>}}",
        "width": 48,
        "height": 48,
        "isDefault": false
    },
    "displayName": "Administrator",
    "isExternalCollaborator": false,
    "_expandable": {
        "operations": "",
        "personalSpace": ""
    },
    "_links": {
        "self": "{{https://<host_url>/wiki/rest/api/user?accountId=<accountId>}}",
        "base": "{{https://<host_url>/wiki}}",
        "context": "/wiki"
    }
}
```

If your Confluence (Cloud) connector is not connected correctly, you will see the following error:
+ CNF-5123: The profile value is invalid. Try again after sometime.

To troubleshoot the issue, check your Confluence (Cloud) URL and make sure it's correct.
