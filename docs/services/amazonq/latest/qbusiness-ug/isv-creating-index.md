Amazon Q Business is no longer open to new customers. For capabilities similar to Q Business, explore Amazon Quick. [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/qbusiness-availability-change.html).

# Creating an Amazon Q index on behalf of a customer
<a name="isv-creating-index"></a>

We recommend creating one Amazon Q Business application environment per customer for better security and data segregation. Alternatively, you can create one Amazon Q Business application environment and share it with multiple customers. This is only recommended when you index documents that are visible to all users in your application.

## Determine the identity management for your customer's Amazon Q Business application
<a name="isv-creating-index-identity-management"></a>

All Amazon Q Business application environments require user access through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity management. You can choose one of two types of user IAM identity management methods supported by Amazon Q Business. These are IAM Identity Center and IAM Federation. Both IAM Identity Center and IAM Federation require an external identity provider setup to allow end users to log in through their identity provider.

IAM Identity Center provides advanced user group management, while Identity and Access Management (IAM) Federation provides more service quotas for the external identity providers. You can choose the identity management that's best suited for you and your end customer when creating their Amazon Q Business application environment. For more information, see [Configuring an Amazon Q Business application environment using AWS IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/create-application.html) and [Creating an Amazon Q Business application environment using Identity Federation through IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/create-application-iam.html)

After the Amazon Q Business application environment is created, set up the retriever and connect the data sources. For a complete list of data source connectors,see [supported connectors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/connectors-list.html). You will need your customers to provide the relevant credentials for each connector that you intend to retrieve data from. For more information, see [Creating a retriever for an Amazon Q Business application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/select-retriever.html) and [Connecting Amazon Q Business data sources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/data-sources.html).

## Calling the SearchRelevantContent API to an Amazon Q index with an IAM Identity Center application environment
<a name="isv-calling-api-idc"></a>

Before end users can retrieve content from the Amazon Q index that you have been granted access to, you need to be able to make authenticated Amazon Q Business API calls, like the `SearchRelevantContent` API operation.

To do this you, must complete the steps in [Make authenticated Amazon Q Business API calls using IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/making-sigv4-authenticated-api-calls.html).

**Note**
Use the instructions from the previous topic, but modify the `QBusinessConversationPermission` permission by adding the additional action `, "qbusiness:SearchRelevantContent"` to the list of allowed actions, as shown in the following sample snippet of the full permission.

    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "QBusinessConversationPermission",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "qbusiness:Chat",
                "... ",
                "qbusiness:SearchRelevantContent"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

------

When configuring access scopes for your Amazon Q Businessapplication environment, add the following using the AWS CLI to enable calling the `SearchRelevantContent` API:

```
    aws sso-admin put-application-access-scope \
    --application-arn identity-center-custom-application-arn \
    --scope "qbusiness:conversations:access"

    aws sso-admin put-application-access-scope \
    --application-arn identity-center-custom-application-arn \
    --scope "qbusiness:content:access"
```

The following AWS CLI example shows how to call this `SearchRelevantContent` API operation after you have these credentials.

```
    aws qbusiness search-relevant-content \
      --application-id ${qbusiness_application_id} \
      --query-text "What is Amazon Q?" \
      --content-source '{"retriever": {"retrieverId": "${retriever_id"}}'
```

## Calling the SearchRelevantContent API on an Amazon Q application environment with IAM Federation
<a name="isv-calling-api-iam"></a>

Before end users can retrieve content from the Amazon Q index that you have been granted access to, you need to be able to make authenticated Amazon Q Business API calls, like the `SearchRelevantContent` API operation.

To do this, complete the steps in [Make authenticated Amazon Q Business API calls using IAM federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/making-sigv4-authenticated-api-calls-iam.html).

**Note**
Use the instructions in the previous topic, but modify the `trustpolicyforfederation` policy by adding the additional action, `"qbusiness:SearchRelevantContent"` to the list of allowed actions, as shown in the following sample snippet of the full permission.

```
{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "QBusinessConversationPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "qbusiness:Chat",
                "qbusiness:SearchRelevantContent"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:qbusiness:us-east-1:111122223333:application/{{application-id}}"
        }
    ]
}
```

The following AWS CLI; example shows how to call this `SearchRelevantContent` API operation after you have these credentials.

```
    aws qbusiness search-relevant-content \
      --application-id ${qbusiness_application_id} \
      --query-text "What is Amazon Q?" \
      --content-source '{"retriever": {"retrieverId": "${retriever_id"}}'
```
