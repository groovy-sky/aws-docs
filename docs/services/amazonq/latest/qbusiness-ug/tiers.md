## Index types

Amazon Q Business offers two types of indexes: starter index and enterprise index. Each index type has different capacity limits measured in index units, which determine the amount of data storage and processing capacity available for your index. For detailed information about index units and capacity, see [Index capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/concepts-terminology.html#index-units).

The following table outlines the features of both index types.

### Amazon Q Business Lite users must upgrade to Amazon Q Business Pro to continue using Q Apps

As of July 1, 2024, Amazon Q Apps are available only to
[Amazon Q Business Pro users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/tiers.html#managing-sub-tiers). Amazon Q Business Lite users will no longer be able to

As of August 30, 2024, all Amazon Q Apps created by Lite
users who did not upgrade their account to Amazon Q Business Pro have been deleted.

## Understanding user subscriptions

User subscriptions are created per Amazon Q Business application or Quick account. Each admin can manage subscriptions for users for their specific
Amazon Q Business application or Quick account.

For applications using IAM Identity Center, AWS will deduplicate subscriptions across all Amazon Q Business applications and Quick accounts, and charge each user only once for
their highest subscription level. Note that deduplication will apply only if the Amazon Q Business applications and Quick accounts share the same IAM Identity Center instance.

Users subscribed to Amazon Q Business applications using Identity Federation
through IAM (IAM Federation), will be charged once per OIDC or SAML IAM Identity
Provider. For example, if a user is subscribed to five different Amazon Q Business
applications all associated with the same IAM Identity Provider, that user will be
charged once. However, if the Amazon Q Business applications are associated with
five IAM Identity Providers, the user will be charged five times.

In scenarios where a user is subscribed to a mix of applications, the charging
structure is as follows:

- For applications using IAM Identity Center, users will be charged once across all these
applications that share the same IAM Identity Center instance.

- For applications using IAM Federation, users will be charged once per IAM
Identity Provider.

User subscriptions are prorated when created or upgraded based on the number of days
left in the calendar month. Any cancellations or downgrades are not prorated and apply
starting in the next calendar month. The charges for user subscription starts only after
first use by the user. After a user's first use, subscription charges will continue each
month until the user's subscriptions have been removed.

For a consolidated view of all your user subscriptions see the [Amazon Q subscriptions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/subscriptions).
Subscriptions can only be viewed centrally and _not_ be created or
updated from the Amazon Q subscription management console.

## Pricing

You are charged for user subscriptions to application environments and for index capacity. You
can choose any combination of the following subscription tiers and indices for your
application environment.

downgrading Amazon Q Business tiers, and more, see [Amazon Q Business Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/pricing).
