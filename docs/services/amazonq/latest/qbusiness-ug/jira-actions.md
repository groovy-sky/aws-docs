# Configuring a Jira Cloud plugin for Amazon Q Business

Jira Cloud is a project management tool that creates issues (tickets) for software
development, product management, and bug tracking. If you’re a Jira Cloud user, you
can create an Amazon Q Business plugin to allow your end users to perform the
following actions from within their web experience chat:

- Read issues

- Create issues

- Search issues

- Change issue status

- Delete issue

- Read sprint

- Move issue to sprint

- Create sprint

- Delete sprint

To create a Jira Cloud plugin, you need configuration information from your
Jira Cloud instance to set up a connection between Amazon Q and
Jira Cloud and allow Amazon Q to perform actions in
Jira Cloud.

For more information on how to use plugins during your web experience chat, see [Using\
plugins](using-plugins.md).

- [Service access roles](#jira-plugin-iam)

- [Creating a plugin](#jira-plugin-create)

## Prerequisites

Before you configure your Amazon Q Jira Cloud plugin, you must do
the following:

- As an admin, create a new OAuth 2.0 Jira Cloud app in the
Jira Cloud developer console with scoped permissions for performing
actions in Amazon Q. To learn how to do this, see [OAuth 2.0 (3LO) apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps) in Jira Cloud Developer
Documentation.

- Make sure sharing is enabled and the following required scopes are
added:

- `read:jira-work`

- `write:jira-work`

- `manage:jira-project`

- `read:sprint:jira-software`

- `write:sprint:jira-software`

- `delete:sprint:jira-software`

- `read:board-scope:jira-software`

- `read:project:jira`

- Note the domain URL of your Jira Cloud instance. For example:
`https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/yourInstanceId`.
To learn how to retrieve your instance ID (Cloud Site ID), go to [How to retrieve Cloud Site Id](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/retrieve-my-atlassian-site-s-cloud-id-1272283178.html) in Jira Software
Support.

- Note your:

- **Access token URL** – For
Jira Cloud OAuth applications, this is
`https://auth.atlassian.com/oauth/token`.

- **Authorization URL** – For
Jira Cloud OAuth applications, this is
`https://auth.atlassian.com/authorize`.

- **Redirect URL** – The URL to
which user needs to be redirected after authentication. If your deployed
web url is `<q-endpoint>`, use
`<q-endpoint>/oauth/callback` . Amazon Q Business will handle OAuth tokens in this URL. This callback
URL needs to be allowlisted in your third-party application.

- **Client ID** – The client ID
generated when you create your OAuth 2.0 application in
Jira Cloud.

- **Client secret** – The client
secret generated when you create your OAuth 2.0 application in
Jira Cloud.

You will need this authentication information during the plugin configuration
process.

## Service access roles

To successfully connect Amazon Q to Jira Cloud, you need to give Amazon Q
the following permission to access your Secrets Manager secret to get your Jira Cloud
credentials. Amazon Q assumes this role to access
your Jira Cloud credentials.

The following is the service access IAM role required:

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:secretsmanager:{{your-region}}:{{your-account-id}}:secret:[[secret-id]]"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

To allow Amazon Q to assume a role, use the following trust policy:

```json

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "QBusinessApplicationTrustPolicy",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "qbusiness.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:SourceAccount": "{{source_account}}"
        },
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:SourceArn":"arn:aws:qbusiness:{{your-region}}:{{source_account}}:application/{{application_id}}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

If you use the console and choose to create a new IAM role,
Amazon Q creates the role for you. If you use the console and choose
to use an existing secret, or you use the API, make sure your IAM role contains these
permissions.

## Creating a plugin

To create a Jira Cloud plugin for your web experience chat, you can use the
AWS Management Console or the [CreatePlugin](../api-reference/api-createplugin.md) API operation. The
following tabs provide a procedure for creating a Jira Cloud plugin using the
console and code examples for the AWS CLI.

Console

**To create a Jira Cloud plugin**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q
    console.

2. From the Amazon Q console, in
    **Applications**, select the name of your
    application from the list of applications.

3. From the left navigation menu, choose
    **Actions**, and then choose
    **Plugins**.

4. For **Plugins**, choose **Add**
**plugin**.

5. For **Add plugins**, choose
    **Jira Cloud**.

6. For **Jira Cloud**, enter the following
    information:
1. In **Plugin name**, for
       **Name** – A name for your
       Amazon Q plugin. The name can include hyphens
       (-), but not spaces, and can have a maximum of 1,000
       alphanumeric characters.

2. In **Domain URL**, for
       **URL** – Enter your
       Jira Cloud domain URL. For example,
       `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/yourInstanceId`.

3. **OAuth 2.0 authentication** – do
       the following:
      1. For **AWS Secrets Manager secret** –
          Choose **Create and add a new**
         **secret** or **Use an existing**
         **one**. Your secret must contain the
          following information:

- **Secret name** – A
name for your Secrets Manager secret.

- **Client ID**
– The client ID generated when you create
your OAuth 2.0 application in
Jira Cloud.

- **Client**
**secret** – The client secret
generated when you create your OAuth 2.0
application in Jira Cloud.

- For **Redirect**
**URL** – The URL to which user
needs to be redirected after authentication. If
your deployed web url is
`<q-endpoint>`, use
`<q-endpoint>/oauth/callback` .
Amazon Q Business will handle OAuth tokens
in this URL. This callback URL needs to be
allowlisted in your third-party
application.

      2. For **Access token**
         **URL** – For Jira Cloud
          OAuth applications, this is
          `https://auth.atlassian.com/oauth/token`.

      3. For **Authorization**
         **URL** – For Jira Cloud
          OAuth applications, this is
          `https://auth.atlassian.com/authorize`.
4. **Service access** – Choose
       **Create and add a new service role**
       or **Use an existing service role**. Make
       sure tha your service role has the necessary
       permissions.
7. **Tags – _optional_**
    – An optional tag to track your plugin.

8. Choose **Save**.
