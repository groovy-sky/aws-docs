# Tagging Amazon Q Business resources
<a name="tagging"></a>

Manage your Amazon Q Business applications and web experiences by assigning tags. You can use tags to categorize your Amazon Q Business resources in various ways. For example, you could categorize by purpose, owner, or application, or any combination. Each tag consists of a *key* and a *value*, both of which you define.

Tags help you to do the following:
+ **Identify and organize your AWS resources** – Many AWS services support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources in different services to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you can tag an Amazon Kendra retriever and the Amazon Q Business web experience that uses the retriever with the same tag.
+ **Allocate costs** – You activate tags on the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard. AWS uses tags to categorize your costs and deliver a monthly cost allocation report to you. For more information, see [Cost Allocation and Tagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html) in the *AWS Billing User Guide*.
+ **Control access to your resources** – You can use tags in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies that control access to Amazon Q Business resources. To activate tag-based access control, you can attach these policies to an IAM role or IAM user. For more information, see [Authorization based on tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-tags).

You can create and manage tags using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the Amazon Q Business API.
