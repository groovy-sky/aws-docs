# Tagging Amazon Q Business resources

Manage your Amazon Q Business applications and web experiences by assigning tags.
You can use tags to categorize your Amazon Q Business resources in various ways. For
example, you could categorize by purpose, owner, or application, or any combination. Each
tag consists of a _key_ and a _value_, both of which
you define.

Tags help you to do the following:

- **Identify and organize your AWS**
**resources** – Many AWS services support tagging, so you can
assign the same tag to resources in different services to indicate that the
resources are related. For example, you can tag an Amazon Kendra retriever and
the Amazon Q Business web experience that uses the retriever with the same
tag.

- **Allocate costs** – You activate tags on the
AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard. AWS uses tags to categorize your
costs and deliver a monthly cost allocation report to you. For more information, see
[Cost Allocation and\
Tagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html) in the _AWS Billing User Guide_.

- **Control access to your resources** – You can
use tags in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies that control access
to Amazon Q Business resources. To activate tag-based access control, you can
attach these policies to an IAM role or IAM user. For more
information, see [Authorization based on tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-tags).

You can create and manage tags using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the Amazon Q Business API.
