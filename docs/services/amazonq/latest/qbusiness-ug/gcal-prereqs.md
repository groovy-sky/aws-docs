# Prerequisites for connecting Amazon Q Business to Google Calendar (Preview)

Before you begin, make sure that you have completed the following
prerequisites.

**In Google Calendar, make sure you**
**have:**

- Created a Google Cloud Platform admin account and have created a Google Cloud
project.

- Activated the Google Calendar API and Admin SDK API in your
admin account.

- Created a service account and downloaded a JSON private key for your
Google Calendar. For information about how to create and
access your private key, see [Create a\
service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete) and [Service account credentials](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-creds) on the Google Cloud website.

On the Google Cloud website:

- Copied your admin account email, your service account email, and your private
key to use for authentication.

- Added the following Oauth scopes, using an admin role, for your user and the
shared directories you want to index:

- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly

- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly

In your AWS account, make sure you have:

- Created an Amazon Q Business application.

- Created an Amazon Q Business retriever and added an
index.

- Created an IAM role for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q
API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.

- Stored your Google Calendar authentication credentials in an AWS
Secrets Manager secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted
the ARN of the secret.

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**

- Created a Amazon Q Business application.

- Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](select-retriever.md).

- Created an [IAM role](iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.

- Stored your Google Calendar authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager
secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the
secret.

###### Note

If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager
secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the
console.
