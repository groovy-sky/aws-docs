<a name="gcal-prereqs"></a>

Before you begin, make sure that you have completed the following prerequisites.

**In Google Calendar, make sure you have:**
+ Created a Google Cloud Platform admin account and have created a Google Cloud project.
+ Activated the Google Calendar API and Admin SDK API in your admin account.
+ Created a service account and downloaded a JSON private key for your Google Calendar. For information about how to create and access your private key, see [Create a service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating) and [Service account credentials](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-creds#key-types) on the Google Cloud website.

On the Google Cloud website:
+ Copied your admin account email, your service account email, and your private key to use for authentication.
+ Added the following Oauth scopes, using an admin role, for your user and the shared directories you want to index:
  + https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly
  + https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly

  In your AWS account, make sure you have:
  + Created an Amazon Q Business application.
  + Created an Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index.
  + Created an IAM role for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.
  + Stored your Google Calendar authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the secret.

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**
+ Created a Amazon Q Business application.
+ Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/select-retriever.html).
+ Created an [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/iam-roles.html#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.
+ Stored your Google Calendar authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the secret.
**Note**
If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the console.
