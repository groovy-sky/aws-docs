**Before you configure your Amazon Q custom plugin, you must**
**ensure you have the following:**

- A defined OpenAPI schema in JSON or YAML (maximum size is 1 MB). In order to
maximize accuracy with Amazon Q Business custom plugin, follow the [best practices for configuring OpenAPI schema\
definitions](plugins-api-schema-best-practices.md) for custom plugins.

application, create OAuth authentication credentials. You need to store these
authentication credentials in a Secrets Manager secret to connect your third-party
application to Amazon Q.
