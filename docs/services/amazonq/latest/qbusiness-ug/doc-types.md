# Supported document formats in Amazon Q Business

When you add documents to an Amazon Q Business application environment ( [directly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/upload-docs.html)
or through [data source connectors](connectors-list.md)) using the console or the API,
Amazon Q Business extracts document content and internally parses these to
optimize chat responses. During this ingestion, there are file size limits depending on
the file type. Video files have a limit of up to 10 GB/10,240 MB. Audio files have a 2
GB/2,048 MB limit. PDF/Word/Powerpoint documents have a 500 MB limit. Excel and other
supported file formats have a 50 MB limit. There are also limits to the amount of text extracted
from these documents. CSV and Excel have a extracted text limit of 10MB, all other document
formats have a limit of 30MB of extracted text.

When you upload documents directly into chat using the [Upload\
files and chat](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/upload-chat-files.html) feature, the size of each file you upload must be 10 MB or less,
and 3.75 MB or less for images. The total parsed content for all files combined has to be
under 665,000 characters.

For images, chat now supports direct uploads of JPEG, JPG, and PNG files. These images can
be used for summarizing information and answering questions.

Additionally, if you’re uploading Comma Separated Values (CSV) or Microsoft Excel (XLS and
XLSX) documents directly into chat, Amazon Q Business performs best for tables with up
to 4 columns and 10 rows. Files indexed by an Amazon Q Business data source connector
or uploaded directly have no such restrictions.

When you directly add files to Amazon Q Business using the [Using direct\
document upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/upload-docs.html) or the [Upload\
files and chat](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/upload-chat-files.html) feature, it considers each file you add a document. When you
connect Amazon Q Business to a data source, what Amazon Q Business
considers—and crawls—as a document varies by connector.

Along with specific formats like PDF, Word, for example, each enterprise data source also
has different entities that it considers documents. To learn about supported entity types
for each data source, see [What is a document?](connector-doc-crawl.md).

For some file types (indicated in the table below), Amazon Q Business can extract semantic
information and insights from various types of images embedded in the documents. You can
enable content extraction when you add or update a data connector, or when you import a file
directly. For more information see [Extracting semantic meaning from embedded visual content with Amazon Q Business](extracting-meaning-from-images.md).

Document formatHow document is treatedPortable Document Format (PDF)

If you're using a data source connector, or directly uploading
documents into your application, Amazon Q can use optical character
recognition (OCR) to convert images of typed, handwritten, or
printed text into machine-readable text. If enabled, Amazon Q Business can
extract semantic information and insights from images and other
visuals.

The maximum number of pages per PDF for optical character
recognition (OCR) or insight extraction from embedded visual
elements is 3000 pages. If your PDF is more than 3000 pages, only
plaintext is extracted.

If you're directly uploading documents into chat, PDFs are
converted to HTML, and only plaintext is extracted.

HyperText Markup Language (HTML)HTML tags are filtered out to extract plaintext. Content must be
between the main `HTML` start and closing tags
( `<HTML>content</HTML>`).Extensible Markup Language (XML)XML tags are filtered out and plaintext is extracted.Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT)Tags are filtered out to extract plaintext.Markdown (MD)Content is extracted as plaintext with Markdown syntax
retained.Comma Separated Values (CSV)Content is extracted as plaintext from each cell, with a single file
treated as a single document result. You can improve answer accuracy on
CSVs by providing a [metadata file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/mapping-doc-attributes.html). Example:

```json

"Attributes":{
    "description":  "A description of your CSV table, a short paragraph providing details about what the use case is and insights you can derive from it.",
    "_document_title": "document title",
    "_file_type": "CSV"
}

```

Microsoft Excel (XLS and XLSX)Content is extracted as plaintext from each cell, with a single file
treated as a single document result. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)Content is extracted as plaintext with JSON syntax retained.Rich Text Format (RTF)RTF syntax is filtered out to extract plaintext content.Microsoft PowerPoint (PPT, PPTX)By default, only plaintext content is extracted from
PowerPoint slides for ingestion. If enabled,
Amazon Q Business can extract semantic information and insights from images and
other visuals. Otherwise, images and other content aren't
extracted.Microsoft Word (DOCX)By default, only plaintext content is extracted from
Word pages for ingestion. If enabled, Amazon Q Business can
extract semantic information and insights from images and other visuals.
Otherwise, images and other content aren't extracted.Plain text (TXT)All text in the text document is extracted.Google SlidesBy default, only plaintext content is extracted from Google
Slides pages for ingestion. If enabled, Amazon Q Business can
extract semantic information and insights from images and other visuals.
Otherwise, images and other content aren't extracted.Google Docs
By default, only plaintext content is extracted from Google
Docs pages for ingestion. If enabled, Amazon Q Business can extract
semantic information and insights from images and other visuals.
Otherwise, images and other content aren't extracted.
