## Prerequisites for integrating the Amazon Q browser extension

As admins, before you can integrate the Amazon Q Business browser
extension, you must complete the following steps.

1. [Get started with Amazon Q Business](getting-started.md)

2. [Create an IAM Identity Center-integrated\
    application](create-application.md) or [Create an IAM federated\
    application environment](create-application-iam.md) and create your Amazon Q Business web
    experience.

3. To use this feature, do the following

- Enable **Allow end users to send queries directly to**
**the LLM** in your Admin controls and guardrails.
For more information, see the [Response settings](guardrails-global-controls.md#guardrails-global-response) topic in
[Admin controls and guardrails](guardrails.md)
and [`chatMode`](../api-reference/api-chatsync.md#qbusiness-ChatSync-request-chatMode) if you
are configuring programmatically.

- If you are using the IAM Identity Center or OpenID Connect
(OIDC) provider in IAM, make sure your IAM role for an
Amazon Q Business web experience using IAM Federation is up to date.
For more information, see [IAM role for an Amazon Q Business\
web experience using IAM Federation](web-experience-iam-role-iam.md).

- [Using the AWS API](#integrating-browser-extensions-browser-extensions-using-aws-api)

### Using the console

1. Sign in to the Amazon Q console.

2. Choose **Applications**, then select the name of
    your application environment from the list.

3. Choose **Integrations** under
    **Enhancements**.

4. Choose **Edit** in the **Browser**
**extensions** section on the main page.

operations.

## Activating and deploying the browser extension

After enabling the browser extension, complete these steps to activate and
deploy it:

1. Allow-list URLs. If you are using

1. An OIDC provider like Okta: you must configure your identity
    provider (IdP) to support browser extension as follows. You will
    need to consult your provider on how to do this.

1. Make sure you enable refresh grants

2. Allow-list the following URLs with the IdP

1. Mozilla based browsers —
    `https://ba6e8e6e4fa44c1057cf5f26fba9b2e788dfc34f.extensions.allizom.org`

2. Chromium based browsers —
    `https://feihpdljijcgnokhfoibicengfiellbp.chromiumapp.org`

2. IAM Identity Center, the above is not required and you can move
    to the next step of installing the browser extension for your
    users.

2. Install the browser extension for all users using the software
    deployment processes of your organization. The following is some
    information about policy settings from the browser vendors using mobile
    device management (MDM) software that may be helpful:

1. Firefox policy settings: [https://mozilla.github.io/policy-templates/#extensionsettings](https://mozilla.github.io/policy-templates)

2. Chrome policy settings: [https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#ExtensionSettings](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies)

3. Edge policy settings: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#extensionsettings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies)
    and guide: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-manage-extensions-ref-guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-manage-extensions-ref-guide)

3. Provide your selected users the browser store URL + Web experience URL
    so they can download and install the browser extension and connect to
    Amazon Q.
