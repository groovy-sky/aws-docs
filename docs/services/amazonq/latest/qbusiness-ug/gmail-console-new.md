# Connecting Amazon Q Business to Gmail using the latest connector (Console)

The following procedure outlines how to connect Amazon Q Business to
Gmail using the latest connector and the AWS Management Console. The latest connector provides a simplified configuration experience with automatic ACL and identity crawling.

###### Connecting Amazon Q to Gmail using the latest connector

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business
     console.

02. From the left navigation menu, choose **Data**
    **sources**.

03. From the **Data sources** page, choose
     **Add data source**.

04. Then, on the **Add data sources** page, from
     **Data sources**, add the **Gmail** data source to your Amazon Q application.

05. Then, on the **Gmail** data source page, enter
     the following information:

06. **Name and description**, do the following:

- For **Data source name** – Name your data
source for easy tracking.

###### Note

You can include hyphens (-) but
not spaces. Maximum of 1,000 alphanumeric characters.

- **Description –**
**_optional_** – Add an optional
description for your data source. This text is viewed only by Amazon Q Business administrators and can be edited later.

07. In **Authentication**, for **AWS Secrets Manager**
    **secret** – Choose an existing secret or create a Secrets Manager secret to store your Gmail authentication
     credentials. If you choose to create a secret, an AWS Secrets Manager secret window
     opens.
    1. Enter the following information in the **Create an AWS Secrets Manager**
       **secret window**:
       1. **Secret Name** – A name for your
           secret.

       2. **Client email** – The client email
           address that you copied from your Google service account. For
           example, it might look like this:

          ```

          "{"clientEmailId":"service-account@123.iam.gserviceaccount.com","adminAccountEmailId":"admin@accounthost.com",
          "privateKey":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----PRIVATE KEY HERE-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"}"
          ```

       3. **Admin account email** – The admin
           account email address that you would like to use.

       4. **Private key** – The private key that
           you copied from your Google service account.

       5. Choose **Save**.
08. For **Additional configuration –**
    **_optional_**, configure the date range filter:

    1. **Date range** – Configure the time period for
        crawling email messages. Choose from:

- _Date range_: Specify start and end dates.
**(optional)** \- if
not provided, the entire inbox is
crawled.

- _Start date onwards_: Specify only a start
date to crawl from that date forward

###### Note

**Simplified configuration:** The latest connector automatically crawls email content and allows configurable draft email crawling. Only date range filtering is available to keep the configuration simple and reliable.

09. In **Sync run schedule**, for
     **Frequency** – Choose how often
     Amazon Q will sync with your data
     source. For more details, see [Sync run schedule](connector-concepts.md#connector-sync-run). To learn how to start a data sync job,
     see [Starting data source connector sync jobs](supported-datasource-actions.md#start-datasource-sync-jobs).

10. **Tags - _optional_** –
     Add tags to search and filter your resources or track your AWS costs. See [Tags](tagging.md) for more details.

11. In **Data source details**, choose **Sync**
    **now** to allow Amazon Q to begin syncing (crawling and
     ingesting) data from your data source. When the sync job finishes, your data
     source is ready to use.

    ###### Note

    View CloudWatch logs for your data source sync job by selecting **View**
    **CloudWatch logs**. If you encounter a `Resource not found
                                exception` error, wait and try again as logs may not be available
    immediately.

    You can also view a detailed document-level report by selecting
    **View Report**. This report shows the status of each
    document during the crawl, sync, and index stages, including any errors. If
    the report is empty for an in-progress job, check back later as data is
    emitted to the report as events occur during the sync process.

    For more information, see [Troubleshooting data source\
    connectors](troubleshooting-data-sources.md#troubleshooting-data-sources-not-indexed).
