# Downloading images to add to responses (API operations)
<a name="semantic-meaning-adding-img-response"></a>

If you have implemented your own application with the Amazon Q Business Chat and ChatSync APIs, you can use the [GetMedia](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_GetMedia.html) API operation to download the images to add to chat responses. You can find the `mediaId` using the Chat, ChatSync and ListMessages API operations. The `mediaId` is listed in the `textMessageSegments` as part of the source attribution.

**Note**
The `mediaBytes` field in the GetMedia API response contains binary image data that may not require base64 decoding, depending on your implementation.

```
aws qbusiness get-media \
--application-id {{app-12345abcde}} \
--conversation-id {{conv-67890fghij}} \
--media-id {{media-12345abcde}} \
--message-id {{msg-67890fghij}}
```
