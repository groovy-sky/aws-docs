If the percentage of documents to be deleted in your sync job exceeds the percentage you selected, the delete phase will be skipped and no documents from this data source will be deleted from your index. For more information, see [Document deletion safeguard](connector-concepts.md#document-deletion-safeguard).

1. In **Additional configuration – *optional***, configure the following simplified options:
   + **Date Range** – Enter the date range for which the connector will crawl your content. End date is optional. Rolling window options available: Last [X] Days/Weeks/Months.

For more details, see [Sync run schedule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/connector-concepts.html#connector-sync-run). To learn how to start a data sync job, see [Starting data source connector sync jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/supported-datasource-actions.html#start-datasource-sync-jobs).

1. **Tags - *optional*** – Add tags to search and filter your resources or track your AWS costs. See [Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/tagging.html) for more details.

1. In **Data source details**, choose **Sync now** to allow Amazon Q to begin syncing (crawling and ingesting) data from your data source. When the sync job finishes, your data source is ready to use.
**Note**
View CloudWatch logs for your data source sync job by selecting **View CloudWatch logs**. If you encounter a `Resource not found exception` error, wait and try again as logs may not be available immediately.
You can also view a detailed document-level report by selecting **View Report**. This report shows the status of each document during the crawl, sync, and index stages, including any errors. If the report is empty for an in-progress job, check back later as data is emitted to the report as events occur during the sync process.
