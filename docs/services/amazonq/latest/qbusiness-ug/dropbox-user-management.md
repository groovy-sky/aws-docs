# How Amazon Q Business connector crawls Dropbox ACLs
<a name="dropbox-user-management"></a>

Connectors support crawling ACL and identity information where applicable based on the data source. If you index documents without ACLs, all documents are considered public. Indexing documents with ACLs ensures data security.

Amazon Q Business supports crawling ACLs for document security by default.

When you connect an Dropbox data source to Amazon Q Business, Amazon Q Business crawls ACL information attached to a document (user and group information) from your Dropbox instance. If you choose to activate ACL crawling, the information can be used to filter chat responses to your end user's document access level.

The group and user IDs are mapped as follows:
+ `_group_ids` – Group IDs exist in Dropbox on files where there are set access permissions. They're mapped from the names of the groups in Dropbox.
+ `_user_id` – User IDs exist in Dropbox on files where there are set access permissions. They're mapped from the user emails as the IDs in Dropbox.
