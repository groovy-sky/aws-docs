ChangeDescriptionDate

Amazon Q Business now supports deleting
attachments

To enable delete attachments support on chats, modify your

permission `qbusiness:DeleteAttachment`. The scoping for
this new permission should be similar to other
`qbusiness:` conversation permissions.

With this change, users can remove attached files in
conversations.

Amazon Q Business plugin actions
support

To allow Amazon Q Business to list plugin actions and to
allow end users to discover plugins in their web experience, modify
the existing _Web experience IAM role_ by adding
the following permissions: `qbusiness:ListPluginActions`,
`qbusiness:ListPluginTypeMetadata`, and
`qbusiness:ListPluginTypeActions`. The scoping for
this new permission should be similar to other
`qbusiness:` conversation permissions.

With this change, Amazon Q Business can list plugin actions and web
experience users can discover plugins in their web experience. For
more information, see [Prerequisites for configuring Amazon Q Business built-in plugins](basic-plugins-prereqs.md).

Amazon Quick plugin support

To allow the Quick plugin to include visuals from Amazon Quick,
modify the existing _Web experience IAM role_ to
add permission for
`quicksight:GenerateEmbedUrlForRegisteredUserWithIdentity`.

With this change, web experience users can view visuals from
Quick. For more information about the Quick plugin, see
[Using the Quick plugin to get insights from structured data](quicksight-plugin.md).

Embedded visual content support

To enable extracting semantic meaning from embedded visual
content, modify the existing _Web experience IAM_
_role_ by adding the permission
`qbusiness:GetMedia`. The scoping for this new
permission should be similar to other `qbusiness:`
conversation permissions.

With this change, if you enable content extraction for a data
source, web experience users can ask questions and get answers
related to the images. When an end user asks a question, Amazon Q Business
retrieves relevant answers from the text and the images. Answers
include the images and links for the documents that contain them.
For more information, see [Extracting semantic meaning from embedded visual content with Amazon Q Business](extracting-meaning-from-images.md).

Recent files support

To enable recent files support on web experiences, modify the
existing _Web experience IAM role_ by adding the
permission `qbusiness:ListAttachments`. The scoping for
this new permission should be similar to other
`qbusiness:` conversation permissions.

With this change, users can find and reuse any recently attached
files in new conversations without uploading the files again.
Additionally, users can now drag and drop files they want to upload
directly into any conversation inside their Amazon Q web
experience.
