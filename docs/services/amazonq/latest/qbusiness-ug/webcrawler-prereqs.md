# Prerequisites for connecting Amazon Q Business to Web Crawler

Before you begin, make sure that you have completed the following
prerequisites.

###### Note

For more information on connecting Web Crawler to Amazon Q Business,
see [Index website contents using the Amazon Q Web Crawler connector for\
Amazon Q Business](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/index-website-contents-using-the-amazon-q-web-crawler-connector-for-amazon-q-business) in the _AWS Machine Learning_
_Blog_.

**For Amazon Q Web Crawler, make sure you**
**have:**

- Copied the seed or sitemap URLs of the websites that you want to index and
stored them in a text file or an Amazon S3 bucket. Each URL must be
included on a separate line.

- **For XML sitemaps:** Copied the sitemap XML and
saved it in an XML file in an Amazon S3 bucket. You can also combine
multiple sitemap XML files into a .zip file.

- **For websites that require basic, NTLM, or Kerberos**
**authentication:**

- Noted your website authentication credentials, which include a
username and password.

###### Note

Amazon Q Web Crawler supports the NTLM authentication
protocol that includes password hashing, and Kerberos authentication
protocol that includes password encryption.

- **For websites that require SAML or login form**
**authentication:**

- Noted your website authentication credentials, which include a
username and password.

- Copied the XPaths (XML Path Language) of the username field (and the
username button if using SAML), password field and button, and copied
the login page URL. You can find the XPaths of elements using your web
browser’s developer tools. XPaths follow this format:
`//tagname[@Attribute='Value']`.

###### Note

Amazon Q Web Crawler uses a headless
Chrome browser and the information from the form
to authenticate and authorize access with an OAuth 2.0 protected
URL.

- **Optional:** Copied the host name and the port
number of the web proxy server if you want to use a web proxy to connect to
internal websites that you want to crawl. The web proxy must be public facing.
Amazon Q supports connecting to web proxy servers backed by basic
authentication, or you can connect with no authentication.

- **Optional:** Copied the virtual private cloud
(VPC) subnet ID if you want to use a VPC to connect to internal websites you
want to crawl. For more information, see [Using Amazon VPC](connector-vpc.md).

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**

- Created an [IAM role](iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the API,
noted the ARN of the IAM role.

- **For websites that require authentication credentials to**
**crawl:** Stored your Web Crawler authentication credentials in an
AWS Secrets Manager secret and, if using the API, noted the ARN of the secret.

###### Note

If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and
Secrets Manager secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application environment on the console.
