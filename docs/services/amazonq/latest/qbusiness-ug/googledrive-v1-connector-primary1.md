The Amazon Q Google Drive connector has the following known limitations:
+ To make a document available to multiple users in Amazon Q Business, you need to explicitly add each user by their email address. Only documents with specific ACLs, including folder-level ACLs, will be available to your users for query responses within Amazon Q. The **Anyone with the link** feature is not supported.
+ Custom field mapping is not available for Google Drive connector as the Google Drive UI does not support creating custom fields.
+ Google Drive API does not support retrieving comments from a permanently deleted file. Comments are retrievable, however, for trashed files. When a file is trashed, the Amazon Q connector will delete comments from the Amazon Q index.
+ Google Drive API does not return comments present in a .docx file.
