# Connecting Google Drive to Amazon Q Business (Original)

###### Note

This documentation covers the original version of the Google Drive
connector. For new implementations, we recommend using the New Google Drive
connector which offers significantly improved performance. The original connector
remains available for customers requiring specific features not yet supported in
new.

## Known limitations for the Amazon Q Business Google Drive connector

The Amazon Q
Google Drive connector has the following known limitations:

- To make a document available to multiple users in Amazon Q Business, you
need to explicitly add each user by their email address. Only documents with
specific ACLs, including folder-level ACLs, will be available to your users for
query responses within Amazon Q. The **Anyone with the**
**link** feature is not supported.

- Custom field mapping is not available for Google Drive connector as the Google
Drive UI does not support creating custom fields.

- Google Drive API does not support retrieving comments from a permanently
deleted file. Comments are retrievable, however, for trashed files. When a file
is trashed, the Amazon Q connector will delete comments from the
Amazon Q index.

- Google Drive API does not return comments present in a .docx file.
