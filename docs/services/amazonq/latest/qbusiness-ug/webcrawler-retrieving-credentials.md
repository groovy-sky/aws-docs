# Retrieving XPaths (XML Path Language) for Web Crawler

If the website you are crawling with Amazon Q Business Web Crawler uses Form or
SAML authentication, you need to provide Amazon Q with the absolute XPaths
for the username and password fields on your web page. Optionally, you may also need to
provide the absolute XPaths to the username and password buttons.

XPaths are expressions used to uniquely identify and locate the content of any XML
like language document (including HTML). Amazon Q uses the XPaths you provide
to confirm access to the website you want to crawl. XPaths usually follow the following
format: `//tagname[@Attribute='Value']`.

The following tabs provide a procedure for retrieving XPaths required for your Amazon Q Web Crawler connector using different web browsers.

Chrome

    username and password buttons.

2. Then, open the context (right-click) menu and then choose the
    **Inspect** option.
