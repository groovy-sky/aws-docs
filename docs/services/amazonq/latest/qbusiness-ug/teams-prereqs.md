# Prerequisites for connecting Amazon Q Business to Microsoft Teams

Before you begin, make sure that you have completed the following
prerequisites.

**In Microsoft Teams, make sure you**
**have:**

- Created a Microsoft Teams account in Office 365.

- Copied your Microsoft 365 Tenant ID. You can find your Tenant
ID in the Properties of your Azure Active Directory Portal. You need this URL to
allow Amazon Q to connect with your Microsoft Teams
data source. For more information, see [Register a Microsoft Entra app and create a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal) on
the Microsoft website.

- Configured an OAuth 2.0 credential token containing a client ID
and client secret. For more information, see [Azure documentation on managing access tokens for Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/manage-teams-identity?pivots=programming-language-csharp) on the
Microsoft website.

- Added the necessary permissions. You can choose to add all permissions, or you
can limit the scope by selecting fewer permissions based on which entities you
want to crawl. _(Application level permissions required for new connector)_ All permissions must be at _application_ level, not delegated. The following table shows permissions by corresponding
entity.

- Generated Microsoft Teams
OAuth 2.0 credentials containing a client ID, client secret,
username, and password. You need these credentials to authenticate Amazon Q to access Microsoft Teams.

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**

- Created a Amazon Q Business application.

- Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](select-retriever.md).

- Created an [IAM role](iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.

- Stored your Microsoft Teams authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager
secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the
secret.

###### Note

If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager
secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the
console.

For a list of things to consider while configuring your data source, see [Data source connector configuration best practices](connector-best-practices.md).
