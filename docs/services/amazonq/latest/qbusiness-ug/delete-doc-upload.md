# Deleting documents uploaded in an Amazon Q Business application

To delete documents that have been directly uploaded to an application environment, you can
use the console or the [BatchDeleteDocument](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_BatchDeleteDociment.html) API operation.
You can delete specific documents or all documents.

The following tabs provide a procedure for the AWS Management Console and code examples for the
AWS CLI.
