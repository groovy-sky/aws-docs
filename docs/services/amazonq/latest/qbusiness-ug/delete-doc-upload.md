# Deleting documents uploaded in an Amazon Q Business application
<a name="delete-doc-upload"></a>

To delete documents that have been directly uploaded to an application environment, you can use the console or the [BatchDeleteDocument](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_BatchDeleteDociment.html) API operation. You can delete specific documents or all documents.

The following tabs provide a procedure for the AWS Management Console and code examples for the AWS CLI.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To delete specific directly uploaded documents**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business console.

1. In **Applications**, select the name of the application environment that your uploaded files belong to.

1. From your applications page, from **Data sources**, choose **Uploaded files**.

1. In **Uploaded files**, choose **Document name**, and then select the documents that you want to delete.
**Note**
You can choose up to 10 files at a time.

   You are returned to the service console while your application environment is deleted. When the deletion process is complete, the console displays a message confirming successful deletion.
