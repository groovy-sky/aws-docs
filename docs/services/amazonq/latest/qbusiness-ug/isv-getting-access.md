# Getting access to your customer's Amazon Q index
<a name="isv-getting-access"></a>

There are two non-mutually exclusive ways to get access to a customer's Amazon Q index:

## Customer grants ISVs (data accessors) access to their Amazon Q index
<a name="isv-getting-access-customer-grants"></a>

Amazon Q Business customers add the ISV as a *data accessor* to their Amazon Q Business application environment and underlying Amazon Q index. This includes Amazon Q customers selecting which data sources and end users can retrieve data from and grant ISVs *cross-account* access to their Amazon Q index based on those permissions.

**Note**
Only ISVs who successfully complete registration with Amazon Q Business can be listed as data accessors.
Only Amazon Q Business application environments that are created using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity center (IDC) are supported.

This process gives Amazon Q customers more flexibility, oversight, and control of their Amazon Q index. Amazon Q customers can create their Q index once, and then grant multiple ISVs access to the same minimizing replication of enterprise data and permissions across multiple ISVs. For more information, see [Data accessors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/data-accessors.html) and [ Accessing a customer's Amazon Q index as a data accessor using cross-account access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/isv-accessing-cross-account.html).

## The ISV sets up the Amazon Q index on behalf of the customer within their own AWS account

ISVs can manage the entire process themselves, creating an Amazon Q Business application environment and the underlying Amazon Q index on behalf of each customer in their AWS account. Customers must provide ISV credentials to connect to their data sources.

At the end of both workflows, ISVs can retrieve the data that they have access to using the Amazon Q index.

**Comparison of onboarding options**

| Scenario | Onboarding with Amazon Q Business | Onboarding with the ISV |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Where is the Amazon Q Business application environment created? | Amazon Q Business customer's account | ISV's account |
| Who sets up Amazon Q Business application environment and underlying Amazon Q index? | Amazon Q Business customer | ISV on behalf of the customer |

We recommend that ISVs use both onboarding workflows to best support all customers.
