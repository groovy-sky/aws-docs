# Prerequisites for connecting Amazon Q Business to Zendesk
<a name="zendesk-prereqs"></a>

Before you begin, make sure that you have completed the following prerequisites.

**In Zendesk, make sure you have:**
+ Created a Zendesk Suite (Professional/Enterprise) administrative account.
+ Copied your Zendesk host URL. For example, {{https://{sub-domain}.zendesk.com/}}. You need this URL to allow Amazon Q to connect with your Zendesk data source.
+ Generated Zendesk OAuth 2.0 with implicit grant credentials containing an implicit grant token.
+ Generated Zendesk OAuth 2.0 credentials containing a client ID, client secret, username, and password. You need these credentials to authenticate Amazon Q to access Zendesk.

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**
+ Created a Amazon Q Business application.
+ Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/select-retriever.html).
+ Created an [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/iam-roles.html#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.
+ Stored your Zendesk authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the secret.
**Note**
If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the console.
