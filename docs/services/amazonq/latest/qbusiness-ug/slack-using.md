###### Important

The Amazon Q Business Slack integration does not support [actions or plugins](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/actions.html).

## Considerations for using the Amazon Q Business App for Slack

1. When Amazon Q is invoked by a user in a public Slack channel, it
    generates responses based on the invoking user's permissions, which may
    include content that other channel members aren't authorized to access.
    To prevent unintended exposure of sensitive information, carefully
    evaluate the use of Amazon Q in public channels.

2. Amazon Q Business does not use customer data for service improvement or for
    improving its underlying large language models (LLMs). Also, none of the
    data you include in your browser extension conversations will be indexed
    into your company's Amazon Q Business instance. For more information, see
    [Amazon Q Business Service improvement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/service-improvement.html).

3. The Amazon Q Business Slack app will have access to the same knowledge
    available in the corresponding Amazon Q Business web experience.

4. To reset, start new conversation, direct message as a _New_
_chat_.

5. When you upload a file, the Amazon Q Slack app will only be able to
    respond from the file (and general knowledge if your Amazon Q admin has
    enabled it). Start a new chat if you want to return to getting answers
    from company knowledge.

6. Closing the Amazon Q Business Slack app side panel will end the current
    conversation. Users can review past conversations in Slack or all
    conversations from all channels (Slack, browser extensions, etc.) in
    your Amazon Q Business web experience. You can access all the history of
    previous conversations including, the names of the attachments in those
    conversations.

7. All conversations in Amazon Q Business are deleted after 30 days of
    inactivity. Slack may store conversations for longer depending on your
    company's Slack conversation history rules.

8. Amazon Q may provide inaccurate responses at times. For more
    information, see [Hallucination](concepts-terms.md#hallucination) in the topic Key concepts of
    Amazon Q Business.

## Troubleshooting the Amazon Q Business App for Slack

My admin has enabled the Amazon Q Business app for Slack, but I'm unable to
login.

Try having a conversation on your Amazon Q web experience first and
then try Slack again. If this doesn't work, then contact your Amazon Q
admin or IT department.

I am getting a "Can't access document" error.

This happens when a document uses an unsupported format from which
Amazon Q app is unable to pull relevant data to provide a helpful
response. If you encounter this error and would like your file
format to be supported, please submit feedback via the feedback
button in the browser extension.

Amazon Q doesn't respond helpfully or doesn't use the context of the
document I added.

Try starting a new chat and adding the document again. If it still
does not work, contact your Amazon Q Business admin for further
support.
