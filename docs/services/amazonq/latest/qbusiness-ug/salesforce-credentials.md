# Setting up Salesforce Online for connecting to Amazon Q Business

Before you connect Salesforce Online to Amazon Q Business, you need to create and
retrieve the Salesforce Online credentials you will use to connect Salesforce Online to
Amazon Q. You will also need to add any authorization permissions needed by
Salesforce Online to connect to Amazon Q.

The following procedure gives you an overview of how to configure Salesforce Online for
Amazon Q.

###### Configuring Salesforce Online for Amazon Q

01. Create a Salesforce Online instance at [https://developer.salesforce.com/signup](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup). Note the username and password you
     logged in with. Also note the Salesforce Online URL that's sent to your email on
     successful instance setup.

    You will need these pieces of information later to connect to Amazon Q.

02. Log in to your Salesforce Online Developer Edition account at [https://login.salesforce.com](https://login.salesforce.com/) or
     Salesforce Online Sandbox Edition account at [https://test.salesforce.com](https://test.salesforce.com/).

03. From the Salesforce Online profile menu, copy your Salesforce Online URL, if you
     haven't already. This will be the URL you will input as host URL in Amazon Q.
