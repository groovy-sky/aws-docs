## Agentic RAG
<a name="agentic-retrieval-augmented-generation"></a>

Agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is an advanced natural language processing technique that enhances Amazon Q Business's standard RAG capabilities. Using Agentic RAG, Amazon Q Business employs multiple intelligent agents and specialized tools to process queries and retrieve and generate responses from your enterprise data using its underlying large language model, while continuously monitoring quality.

With Agentic RAG system processes queries through a combination of the following coordinated steps:
+ Analyzes both the user's question and conversation history and determines which retrieval tools to use
+ Intelligently triggers multiple retrieval operations as needed
+ Synthesizes information from various sources, and generate responses using its underlying large language model

For more information, see [Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/agentic-rag.html).

## Application environment

Amazon Q Business integrations enhance user productivity by bringing AI-powered assistance directly into daily workflows through third-party enterprise tools. These integrations include browser extensions for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox browsers, as well as applications for Slack, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft Word. Each integration must be configured and deployed to bring Amazon Q Business capabilities directly within those enterprise tools, allowing users to access Amazon Q's knowledge without context switching during their work. For more information, see [Integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/integrations.html).

## ISV integration
<a name="isv-integration"></a>

Amazon Q Business enables independent software vendors (ISVs) to leverage customer enterprise data through the Amazon Q index to enhance their applications with generative AI capabilities. ISVs can access this data through two methods: either by being added as a data accessor to an existing customer's Amazon Q index, or by creating a Amazon Q application on behalf of the customer. The `SearchRelevantContent` API operation allows ISVs to retrieve relevant content from the customer's data sources while maintaining security and access controls, ensuring users only see content they have permission to access. This integration enables software providers to build enhanced application experiences without having to directly connect to or index individual data sources. For more information, see [Amazon Q index for independent software vendors (ISVs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/isv.html).

## Large language model
<a name="llm"></a>

A large language model (LLM) is a language-based, machine learning model that's tuned to a large number (billions) of parameters and trained on a large corpus of documents.

## Principal Mapping
<a name="principal-mapping"></a>

Principal mapping is used to connect users and groups with their user ids and group membership information in data sources connected to the application.

## Plugins
<a name="plugins"></a>

Amazon Q Business includes a plugins feature that you can use to interact with third-party services such as Jira and Salesforce. With the plugins feature, you can perform actions specific to that service (like creating a ticket) from within your Amazon Q Business web experience chat. For more information, see [Plugins](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/plugins.html).

## Quick prompts
<a name="quick-prompt"></a>

Use this feature to prompt your end user to engage with their web experience chat in specific ways. For example, you can show the available [configured plugins ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/querying-structured-data.html) or inform users that they can choose to summarize their chat.

## Response personalization
<a name="response-personalization"></a>

Response personalization is a Amazon Q Business feature that customizes chat responses to end users based on metadata associated with them—specifically address and job-related information—in your SSO instance. This feature enhances the relevance of responses by tailoring them to the user's specific context within the organization. To use response personalization effectively, you must have already added the necessary user information in your SSO instance. For more information, see [Response settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/guardrails-global-controls.html#guardrails-global-response).

## Retriever
<a name="retriever"></a>

A retriever pulls data from an index in real time during a conversation. Amazon Q Business supports a native index retriever and also a Amazon Kendra index retriever.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation
<a name="retrieval-augmented-generation"></a>

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique. Using RAG, generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) is conditioned on specific documents that are retrieved from a dataset. Amazon Q Business has a built-in RAG system. A RAG model has the following two components:
+ A *retrieval* component retrieves relevant documents for the user query.
+ A *generation* component takes the query and the retrieved documents and then generates an answer to the query using a large language model.

## Relevance tuning
<a name="boosting"></a>

You can choose to use document attributes to boost and tune the relevance of chat responses for end users from specific content. For example, if you have a document attribute associated document creation or updating date, you use these attributes to boost chat responses from more recently created or updated documents. For more information, see [Relevance tuning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/business-use-dg/metadata-boosting.html).

## Subscription tiers
<a name="subscription-tiers"></a>

Amazon Q Business offers multiple user subscription tiers and index types that can be combined to meet your organization's needs. User subscription tiers determine the features available to end users, with both Lite and Pro tier users having access to browser extensions. Index types include starter index and enterprise index, each with different capabilities and storage capacities. You can choose any combination of index types and user subscriptions for your Amazon Q Business application. For more information, see [Amazon Q Business subscription tiers and index types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/tiers.html).
