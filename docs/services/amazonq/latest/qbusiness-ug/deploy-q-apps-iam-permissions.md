# IAM permissions for using Amazon Q Apps

If the users of your deployed web experience want to create lightweight, purpose-built
Amazon Q Apps within your broader Amazon Q Business application environment, you must include
the following policy permissions.

###### Note

This Amazon Q Apps IAM policy released on July 10, 2024 supports the ability for
users to view and specify approved _data sources_ at the
card-level and use other future features. To use these features, you must update all
roles for Amazon Q Apps that have been created prior to this date with this new
policy.
