# Connecting Amazon Q Business to Web Crawler using APIs

To connect Amazon Q Business to Web Crawler using the Amazon Q API,
call `CreateDataSource`. Use this API to:

- provide a name and tags for your data source

- an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role with permission to access
the data source and required resources

- a sync schedule for Amazon Q to check the documents in your data
source

- a Amazon VPC configuration

For more information on available parameters, see [CreateDataSource](../api-reference/api-createdatasource.md) in the [Amazon Q API\
reference](../api-reference/welcome.md).

Provide the seed or starting point URLs, or the sitemap URLs, as part of the connection
configuration or repository endpoint details. Also specify the website authentication
credentials and authentication type if your websites require authentication, and other necessary
configurations.

expression patterns to _include_ crawling certain URLs and indexing
any hyperlinks on these URL webpages. URLs that match the patterns are included in the
index. URLs that don't match the patterns are excluded from the index. If a URL
matches both an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes
precedence, and the URL and website's webpages aren't included in the
index.

`array`( `string`)

No

- `exclusionURLCrawlPatterns`

- `exclusionURLIndexPatterns`

These are sub-properties of `additionalProperties`. A list of
regular expression patterns to _exclude_ crawling certain URLs and

excluded from the index. URLs that don't match the patterns are included in the index.
If a URL matches both an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes
precedence, and the URL/website's webpages aren't included in the
index.

`array`( `string`)

No

`inclusionFileIndexPatterns`

This is a sub-property of `additionalProperties`. A list of
regular expression patterns to _include_ certain web page files.
Files that match the patterns are included in the index. Files that don't match the
patterns are excluded from the index. If a file matches both an inclusion and
exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence, and the file isn't included
in the index.

`array`( `string`)

No

`exclusionFileIndexPatterns`

This is a sub-property of `additionalProperties`. A list of
regular expression patterns to _exclude_ certain webpage files.
Files that match the patterns are excluded from the index. Files that don't match the
patterns are included in the index. If a file matches both an inclusion and exclusion
pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence, and the file isn't included in the
index.

`array`( `string`)

No

`proxy`

This is a sub-property of `additionalProperties`. Configuration
information required to connect to your internal websites through a web
proxy.

`object`

No

`host`

This is a sub-property of `proxy`. The host name of the proxy
server that you want to use to connect to internal websites.

For example,
the host name of _https://a.example.com/page1.html_ is `a.example.com`.

`string`

No`port`

This is a sub-property of `proxy`. The port number of the proxy
server that you want to use to connect to internal websites.

For example,
the port 443 would be `443`.

`string`

No

`secretArn`

This is a sub-property of `proxy`. If web proxy credentials are
required to connect to a website host, you can create an AWS Secrets Manager secret
that stores the credentials. Provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
secret.

`string`

The minimum length is 20and the maximum length is 2,048 characters

The JSON structure for this is

```json

{
          "userName": string,
          "password": string
          }
```

No`secretArn`

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Secrets Manager secret that's used if
your websites require authentication to access the websites. You store the
authentication credentials for the website in the secret that contains JSON key-value
pairs.

If you use basic, or NTLM/Kerberos, enter the username and password. The JSON keys
in the secret must be `userName` and
`password`. NTLM authentication protocol includes
password hashing, and Kerberos authentication protocol includes password
encryption.

If you use SAML or form authentication, enter the username and password, XPath for
the username field (and username button if using SAML), XPaths for the password field
and button, and the login page URL. The JSON keys in the secret must be
`userName`, `password`,
`userNameFieldXpath`,
`userNameButtonXpath`,
`passwordFieldXpath`,
`passwordButtonXpath`, and
`loginPageUrl`. You can find the XPaths (XML Path
Language) of elements using your web browser's developer tools. XPaths usually follow
this format: `//tagname[@Attribute='Value']`.

Amazon Q also checks if the endpoint information (seed URLs) included
in the secret is the same the endpoint information specified in your data source
endpoint configuration details.

If you use `seedUrlConnections` or `s3SeedUrl` as the
connection type, you can choose from all authentication values
( `NoAuthentication`, `BasicAuth`, `NTLM_Kerberos`,
`Form`, `SAML`) depending on the use case.

If you use `siteMapUrls` or `s3SiteMapUrl` as connection
type, the `authentication` should be `NoAuthentication`.

You must use the following JSON structure for your `authentication`
values.

- For `BasicAuth`/ `NTLM_Kerberos`

```json

{
                    "userName": String,
                    "password": String
                  }
```

- For `Form`/ `SAML`

```json

{
                  "loginPageUrl": String,
                  "userName": String,
                  "password": String,
                  "userNameFieldXpath": String,
                  "passwordFieldXpath": String,
                  "userNameButtonXpath": String,
                  "passwordButtonXpath": String
                }
```

###### Note

XML Path Language (XPaths) of elements can be found using the web browser's
developer tools. XPaths usually follow this format:
`//tagname[@Attribute='Value'`\].

No`version`The version of this template that's currently supported.

`string`

The default value is `1.0.0`.

No`implicitWaitDuration`

Specifies how long the connector will wait, in seconds, before crawling a
webpage.

Range: 0-10

eg. "implicitWaitDuration": "5"
