# Configuring the Amazon Q Business Slack integration for use
<a name="slack-configuration"></a>

The Amazon Q Business integration for Slack is only available for use by Amazon Q Business Pro users.

**Note**
When Amazon Q is invoked by a user in a public Slack channel, it generates responses based on the invoking user's permissions, which may include content that other channel members aren't authorized to access. To prevent unintended exposure of sensitive information, carefully evaluate the use of Amazon Q in public channels.
The Amazon Q Business customer integrating Slack must have a paid Slack workspace.
Amazon Q only supports user access management through IAM Identity Center for Slack integrations. This includes authentication using external SAML providers through IAM Identity Center. To integrate Slack with Amazon Q, you must create an IAM Identity Center-integrated application. For more information, see [Create an IAM Identity Center-integrated application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/create-application.html).
Amazon Q doesn't support Slack integrations for [Amazon Q applications using IAM federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/create-application-iam.html) for user access management.
Access using the Amazon Q Business API is not supported at this time.
Amazon Q Business does not use your user data for service improvement or for training its underlying large language models (LLMs). For more information, see [Amazon Q Business Service improvement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/service-improvement.html).
Uploading documents and conversations will follow the same behavior as the web experience. For more information, see the [Chat and file uploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/using-web-experience.html#upload-documents) section in the Using web experience topic.
