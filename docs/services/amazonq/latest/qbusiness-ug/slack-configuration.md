# Configuring the Amazon Q Business Slack integration for use

The Amazon Q Business integration for Slack is only available for use by Amazon Q Business Pro
users.

###### Note

- When Amazon Q is invoked by a user in a public Slack channel, it
generates responses based on the invoking user's permissions, which may
include content that other channel members aren't authorized to access.
To prevent unintended exposure of sensitive information, carefully
evaluate the use of Amazon Q in public channels.

- The Amazon Q Business customer integrating Slack must have a paid Slack
workspace.

- Amazon Q only supports user access management through IAM Identity Center for Slack
integrations. This includes authentication using external SAML providers
through IAM Identity Center. To integrate Slack with Amazon Q, you must create an
IAM Identity Center-integrated application. For more information, see [Create an IAM Identity Center-integrated\
application](create-application.md).

- Amazon Q doesn't support Slack integrations for [Amazon Q applications using IAM\
federation](create-application-iam.md) for user access management.

- Access using the Amazon Q Business API is not supported at this time.

- Amazon Q Business does not use your user data for service improvement or for
training its underlying large language models (LLMs). For more
information, see [Amazon Q Business Service improvement](service-improvement.md).

- Uploading documents and conversations will follow the same behavior as
the web experience. For more information, see the [Chat and file uploads](using-web-experience.md#upload-documents) section in the Using web experience
topic.

## Prerequisites

As admins, before you can add the Amazon Q Business integration to your Slack, you
must complete the following steps:

1. Must have a paid Slack workspace

2. [Get started\
    with Amazon Q Business](getting-started.md)

3. [Create an\
    IAM Identity Center-integrated application environment](create-application.md) environment
    and create your Amazon Q Business web experience.

###### Note

Amazon Q doesn't support Slack integrations for [Amazon Q applications using IAM\
federation](create-application-iam.md) for user access management.

4. Optionally, to enhance your end users' experience with Amazon Q in
    Slack, you can enable **Allow end users to send**
**queries directly to the LLM** in your Admin controls and
    guardrails. For more information, see the [Response settings](guardrails-global-controls.md#guardrails-global-response) topic in [Admin controls and\
    guardrails](guardrails.md) and `chatMode` if you are configuring
    programmatically.

5. Add the two IAM roles and trust policies for adding integrations.
    For more information, see [IAM roles and trust policy for your\
    integrations](amazon-q-business-integrations-iam.md)

6. Admin access to your Slack workspace.

7. Your Slack workspace ID. Your WorkSpace ID must start with a
    _T_. One way to find your Slack workspace ID is
    by navigating to your Slack workspace and starting a chat with the
    _Slack Developer Tools_ app running the
    `/sdt whoami` command. For more information, see [Locate your Slack URL or ID](https://slack.com/help/articles/221769328-Locate-your-Slack-URL-or-ID) in the Slack help
    center.
