# Using Amazon VPC with Amazon Q Business connectors
<a name="connector-vpc"></a>

Amazon Q Business can connect to a virtual private cloud (VPC) that you created with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud to index content stored in data sources running in your private cloud. When you create a data source connector, you can provide security group and subnet identifiers for the subnet that contains your data source. With this information, Amazon Q Business creates an elastic network interface that it uses to securely communicate with your data source within your VPC.

To set up an Amazon Q Business data source connector with Amazon VPC, you can use either the AWS Management Console or the [CreateDataSource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_CreateDataSource.html) API operation. If you use the console, you connect a VPC during the connector configuration process.

**Note**
The Amazon VPC feature is optional when setting up an Amazon Q Business data source connector. If your data source is accessible from the public internet, you don't need to enable the Amazon VPC feature. Not all Amazon Q Business data source connectors support Amazon VPC.

If your data source isn't running on Amazon VPC and isn't accessible from the public internet, you first connect your data source to your VPC using a virtual private network (VPN). Then, you can connect your data source to Amazon Q Business by using a combination of Amazon VPC and AWS Virtual Private Network. For information about setting up a VPN, see the [Site-to-Site VPN documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/).

## Viewing Amazon VPC identifiers
<a name="viewing-vpc-identifiers"></a>

The identifiers for subnets and security groups are configured in the Amazon VPC console. To view the identifiers, use the following procedures.

**To view subnet identifiers**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).

1. From the navigation pane, choose **Subnets**.

1. From the **Subnets** list, choose the subnet that contains your database server.

1. From the **Details** tab, make a note of the identifier in the **Subnet ID** field.

**To view security group identifiers**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).

1. From the navigation pane, choose **Security groups**.

1. From the security group list, choose the group that you want the identifier for.

1. From the **Details** tab, make a note of the identifier in the **Security Group ID** field.

## Checking your data source IAM role
<a name="vpc-iam-roles"></a>

Make sure that your data source connector AWS Identity and Access Management IAM) role contains permissions to access your Amazon VPC.

If you use the console to create a new role for your IAM role, Amazon Q Business automatically adds the correct permissions to your IAM role on your behalf. If you use the API, or use an existing IAM role, check that your role contains permissions to access Amazon VPC. To verify that you have the right permissions, see [IAM roles for data sources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/iam-roles.html#iam-roles-ds).

You can modify an existing data source to use a different Amazon VPC subnet. However, check your data source's IAM role and, if necessary, modify it to reflect the change for the Amazon Q Business data source connector to work properly.

## Step 3. Configure your external data source and Amazon VPC
<a name="connector-vpc-prerequisites-3"></a>

Make sure that your external data source has the correct permissions configuration and network settings for Amazon Q Business to access it. You can find detailed instructions on how to configure your data sources in the prerequisites section of each connector page.

Also, check your Amazon VPC settings and make sure that your external data source is reachable from the subnet you will assign to Amazon Q Business. To do this, we recommend that you create an Amazon EC2 instance in the same subnet with the same security groups and test access to your data source from this Amazon EC2 instance.
