# Connecting Amazon Q Business to SharePoint Server 2016 using the console

The following procedure outlines how to connect Amazon Q Business to
SharePoint Server 2016 using the AWS Management Console.

###### Connecting Amazon Q to SharePoint Server 2016

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business
     console.

02. From the left navigation menu, choose **Data**
    **sources**.

03. From the **Data sources** page, choose
     **Add data source**.

04. Then, on the **Add data sources** page, from
     **Data sources**, add the **SharePoint** data source to your Amazon Q application.

05. Then, on the **SharePoint Server 2016** data source page, enter
     the following information:

06. **Name and description**, do the following:

- For **Data source name** – Name your data
source for easy tracking.

###### Note

You can include hyphens (-) but
not spaces. Maximum of 1,000 alphanumeric characters.

- **Description –**
**_optional_** – Add an optional
description for your data source. This text is viewed only by Amazon Q Business administrators and can be edited later.

07. In **Source**, enter the following information:
    1. In **Source**, for **Hosting**
       **Method** – Choose **SharePoint**
       **Server**.

    2. **Choose SharePoint Version** –
        Choose **SharePoint 2016**.

    3. **Site URLs specific to your SharePoint repository**
        – Enter the SharePoint host URLs. The format for the host URLs
        you enter is
        `https://yourcompany/sites/mysite`. The URL
        must start with `https` protocol. Separate URLs with a new
        line. You can add up to 100 URLs.

    4. **Domain** – Enter the
        SharePoint domain.

    5. **SSL certificate location** – Enter the
        Amazon S3 path to your SSL certificate file.
08. For **Web proxy – _optional_**
     – Enter the host name (without the `http://` or
     `https://` protocol), and the port number used by the host URL
     transport protocol. The numeric value of the port number must be between 0 and
     65535.

09. For **Authorization** – Amazon Q Business crawls
     ACL information by default to ensure responses are generated only from documents
     your end users have access to. You can manage ACLs by selecting **Enable ACLs** to enable ACLs or **Disable ACLs**
     to disable them. To manage ACLs, you need specific IAM permissions. See [Grant permission to create data sources with ACLs\
     disabled](setting-up.md#DisableAclOnDataSource) for more details.See [Authorization](connector-concepts.md#connector-authorization) for more details. For
     SharePoint Server, you can choose from the following ACL
     options:

    1. **Email ID with Domain from IDP** – Access
        control is based on email IDs that are extracted from email domains
        fetched from the underlying identity provider (IdP). You provide the IdP
        connection details in your Secrets Manager secret during
        **Authentication**.

    2. **Email ID with Custom Domain** – Access
        control is based on email IDs. Provide the email domain value. For
        example, `"amazon.com"`. The email domain is
        used to construct the email ID for access control. You must enter your
        email domain using **Add Email Domain**.

See [Authorization](connector-concepts.md#connector-authorization) for more details.

10. For **Authentication**, choose between **SharePoint**
    **App-Only authentication**, **NTLM**
    **authentication**, and **Kerberos authentication**,
     based on your use case.
    1. Enter the following information for both **NTLM**
       **authentication** and **Kerberos**
       **authentication**:

       For **AWS Secrets Manager secret** – Choose an existing
        secret or create a Secrets Manager secret to store your
        SharePoint authentication credentials. If you choose
        to create a secret, an AWS Secrets Manager secret window opens. Enter the
        following information in the window:

- **Secret name** – A name for your
secret.

- **Username** – Username for your
SharePoint account.

- **Password** – Password for your
SharePoint account.

If using **Email ID with Domain from IDP**, also
enter your:

- **LDAP Server Endpoint** – Endpoint of
LDAP server, including protocol and port number. For example:
`ldap://example.com:389`.

- **LDAP Search Base** – Search base of
LDAP user. For example:
`CN=Users,DC=sharepoint,DC=com`.

- **LDAP username** – Your LDAP
username.

- **LDAP Password** – Your LDAP
password.

    2. Enter the following information for **SharePoint App-Only**
       **authentication**:

       For **AWS Secrets Manager secret** – Choose an existing
        secret or create a Secrets Manager secret to store your
        SharePoint authentication credentials. If you choose
        to create a secret, an AWS Secrets Manager secret window opens. Enter the
        following information in the window:

- **Secret name** – A name for your
secret.

- **Client ID** – The
SharePoint client ID that you generated when
you registered App Only at Site Level. The ClientID format is
ClientID@TenantId. For example,
`ffa956f3-8f89-44e7-b0e4-49670756342c@888d0b57-69f1-4fb8-957f-e1f0bedf82fe`.

- **SharePoint client secret** – The
SharePoint client secret generated when your
register for App Only at Site Level.

**Note:** Because client IDs and
client secrets are generated for single sites only when you
register SharePoint Server for App Only authentication, only one
site URL is supported for SharePoint App Only
authentication.

If using **Email ID with Domain from IDP**, also
enter your:

- **LDAP Server Endpoint** – Endpoint of
LDAP server, including protocol and port number. For example:
`ldap://example.com:389`.

        repository subnets that define the subnets and IP ranges
        the repository instance uses in the selected VPC.

    2. **VPC security groups** –
        Choose up to 10 security groups that allow access to
        your data source. Ensure that the security group allows
        incoming traffic from Amazon EC2 instances and
        devices outside your VPC. For databases, security group
        instances are required.

For more information, see [VPC](connector-concepts.md#connector-vpc).

12. **Identity crawler** – Amazon Q crawls
     identity information from your data source by default to ensure responses are
     generated only from documents end users have access to. Only **Local**
    **Group Members** will be crawled by **Identity**
    **crawler**. For more information, see [Identity crawler](connector-concepts.md#connector-identity-crawler).

13. **IAM role** – Choose
     an existing IAM role or create an IAM role to access your repository credentials and
     index content.

    ###### Note

    Creating a new service IAM role is recommended.

    For more information, see [IAM role](sharepoint-server-2016-connector.md#sharepoint-server-2016-iam).

14. In **Sync scope**, choose from the following options :

       **regex patterns** – Add regular expression patterns
        for **Links**, **Pages**, and
        **Events** to include specific entities instead of
        syncing all your documents.

    3. **Regex patterns** – Add regular expression
        patterns to include or exclude files by **File path**,
        **File name**, **File type**,
        **OneNote section name**, and **OneNote**
       **page name** instead of syncing all your documents. You can
        add up to 100 patterns.

       ###### Note

       Any valid regex pattern is supported. For example, if you use the
       regex `^QBusiness*`, any content starting with the word
       `QBusiness` followed by any number of characters will
       be filtered ( `QBusiness_doc1` or `QBusiness`,
       but not `doc1_QBusiness`).

       **Document deletion safeguard** \- _optional_–To safeguard
        your documents from deletion during a sync job, select **On** and enter an integer between 0 - 100. If
        the percentage of documents to be deleted in your sync job exceeds the percentage you selected, the
        delete phase will be skipped and no documents from this data source will be deleted from your index. For more information, see
        [Document deletion safeguard](connector-concepts.md#document-deletion-safeguard).
15. In **Sync mode**, choose how you
     want to update your index when your data source
     content changes. When you sync your data source with
     Amazon Q for the first time, all content
     is synced by default.

- **Full sync** – Sync
all content regardless of the previous sync
status.

- **New or modified content**
**sync** – Sync only new and modified
documents.

- **New, modified, or deleted**
**content sync** – Sync only new,
modified, and deleted documents.

For more details, see [Sync mode](connector-concepts.md#connector-sync-mode).

16. In **Sync run schedule**, for
     **Frequency** – Choose how often
     Amazon Q will sync with your data
     source. For more details, see [Sync run schedule](connector-concepts.md#connector-sync-run). To learn how to start a data sync job,
     see [Starting data source connector sync jobs](supported-datasource-actions.md#start-datasource-sync-jobs).

17. **Tags - _optional_** –
     Add tags to search and filter your resources or track your AWS costs. See [Tags](tagging.md) for more details.

18. **Field mappings** – A list of data source document
     attributes to map to your index fields.

    ###### Note

    Add or update the fields from the **Data**
    **source details** page after you finish adding your data source.

    You can choose from two types of fields:

    1. **Default** – Automatically created by
        Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
        can't edit these.

    2. **Custom** – Automatically created by
        Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
        can edit these. You can also create and add new custom fields.

       ###### Note

       Support for adding custom fields varies by connector. You
       won't see the **Add field** option if your
       connector doesn't support adding custom fields.

For more information, see [Field mappings](connector-concepts.md#connector-field-mappings).

19. In **Data source details**, choose **Sync**
    **now** to allow Amazon Q to begin syncing (crawling and
     ingesting) data from your data source. When the sync job finishes, your data
     source is ready to use.

    ###### Note

    View CloudWatch logs for your data source sync job by selecting **View**
    **CloudWatch logs**. If you encounter a `Resource not found
                                exception` error, wait and try again as logs may not be available
    immediately.

    You can also view a detailed document-level report by selecting
    **View Report**. This report shows the status of each
    document during the crawl, sync, and index stages, including any errors. If
    the report is empty for an in-progress job, check back later as data is
    emitted to the report as events occur during the sync process.
