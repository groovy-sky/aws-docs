# Managing subscriptions for an Amazon Q Business application using APIs
<a name="subscription-management-api"></a>

Amazon Q Business provides APIs to manage subscriptions in your Amazon Q Business application. You can use these APIs to implement your own subscription management solution if you create a Amazon Q Business application environment programmatically.

**Note**
As of Dec 17, 2024, Amazon Q Business will recognize all email addresses as case-insensitive and recognize subaddresses as equivalent to the original email address. For example, JohnDoe@example.com, johndoe@example.com, and johndoe\+work@example.com will be considered the same email address. For assistance with applications or to report a concern, contact Support, sign into the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/) .
