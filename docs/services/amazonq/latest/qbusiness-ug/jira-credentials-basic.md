You can connect Amazon Q to Jira using basic authentication credentials. The following procedure gives you an overview of how to configure Jira to connect to Amazon Q using basic authentication.

**Configuring Jira basic authentication for Amazon Q**

1. Log in to your account from [Jira](https://jira.atlassian.com/). Note the username you logged in with. You will need this later to connect to Amazon Q.

1. From your Jira home page, copy the Jira URL from your Jira browser URL. For example: {{https://example.atlassian.net}}. You will need this later to connect to Amazon Q.

1. Then, go to [Security]( https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens.) page in Jira.

1. From the **API tokens** page, select **Create API token**.

1. In the **Create an API token** dialog box that opens, for **Label**, add a name for your API token. Then, select **Create**.

1. From the **Your new API token** dialog box, copy the API token and save it in a text editor of your choice. You can't retrieve the API token once you close the dialog box.

1. Select **Close**.

You now have the username, Jira URL, and Jira API token you need to connect to Amazon Q with basic authentication.
