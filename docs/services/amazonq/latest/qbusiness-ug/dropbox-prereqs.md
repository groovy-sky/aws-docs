# Prerequisites for connecting Amazon Q Business to Dropbox

Before you begin, make sure that you have completed the following
prerequisites.

**In Dropbox, make sure you have:**

- Created a Dropbox Advanced account and set up an admin
user.

- Created a Dropbox app with a unique **App**
**name**, activated **Scoped Access**. For more
information, see [Dropbox documentation on creating an app](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/getting-started) on the
Dropbox website.

- Activated **Full Dropbox** permissions on the
Dropbox console and added the following permissions:

- `files.content.read`

- `files.metadata.read`

- `sharing.read`

- `file_requests.read`

- `groups.read`

- `team_info.read`

- `team_data.content.read`

- `account_info.read`

- `members.read`

- `team_data.member`

- Create an authorization URL containing client ID (app-key), redirect\_uri, response type, access type and scopes. Obtain User Authorization by signing in to Dropbox and grant your application the requested permissions.

`Sample Authorization URL:`

`https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize`

`?client_id=abcd1234example`

`&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fyourapp.com%2Fcallback`

`&response_type=code`

`&token_access_type=offline`

`&scope=files.metadata.read%20files.content.read`

- Exchange authorization code for tokens by requesting tokens from the Dropbox token endpoint.

- curl https://api.dropboxapi.com/oauth2/token -d code=AUTH\_CODE -d grant\_type=authorization\_code -d client\_id=APP\_KEY -d client\_secret=APP\_SECRET

- Replace AUTH\_CODE with the obtained authorization code, APP\_KEY and APP\_SECRET with your application client ID (App key) and secret key.

- Noted your Dropbox app key, Dropbox app secret,
and Dropbox access token and refresh token for OAuth 2.0 authentication
credentials.

- Generate an OAuth 2.0 access token with token\_access\_type=offline to obtain a short‑lived access token and a long‑lived refresh token. For more information, see [Dropbox\
documentation on OAuth authentication](https://developers.dropbox.com/oauth-guide) on the
Dropbox website.

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**

- Created a Amazon Q Business application.

- Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](select-retriever.md).

- Created an [IAM role](iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.

- Stored your Dropbox authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager
secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the
secret.

###### Note

If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager
secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the
console.

For a list of things to consider while configuring your data source, see [Data source connector configuration best practices](connector-best-practices.md).
