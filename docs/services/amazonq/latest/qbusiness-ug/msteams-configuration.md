**Note**
When Amazon Q is invoked by a user in a public Teams channel, it generates responses based on the invoking user's permissions, which may include content that other channel members aren't authorized to access. To prevent unintended exposure of sensitive information, carefully evaluate the use of Amazon Q in public channels.
The Amazon Q Business customer integrating Microsoft Teams (Teams) must have a paid Teams organization.
Amazon Q supports users who authenticate using external SAML providers through IAM Identity Center. For more information, see [Create an IAM Identity Center-integrated application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/create-application.html).
