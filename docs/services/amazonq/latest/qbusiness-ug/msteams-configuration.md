# Configuring the Amazon Q Business Microsoft Teams (Teams) integration for use

###### Note

- When Amazon Q is invoked by a user in a public Teams channel, it
generates responses based on the invoking user's permissions, which may
include content that other channel members aren't authorized to access.
To prevent unintended exposure of sensitive information, carefully
evaluate the use of Amazon Q in public channels.

- The Amazon Q Business customer integrating Microsoft Teams (Teams) must have
a paid Teams organization.

- Amazon Q supports users who authenticate using external SAML providers
through IAM Identity Center. For more information, see [Create an IAM Identity Center-integrated\
application](create-application.md).

- Amazon Q application environment created with IAM Federation do not support
integrations with Teams at this time.

- Access using the Amazon Q Business API is not supported at this time.

- Amazon Q Business does not use your user data for service improvement or for
training its underlying large language models (LLMs). For more
information, see [Amazon Q Business Service improvement](service-improvement.md).

- Uploading documents and conversations will follow the same behavior as
the web experience. For more information, see the [Chat and file uploads](using-web-experience.md#upload-documents) section in the Using web experience
topic.
