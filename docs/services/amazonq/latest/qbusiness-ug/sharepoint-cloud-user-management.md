# How Amazon Q Business connector crawls SharePoint (Online) ACLs

When you connect an SharePoint (Online) data source to Amazon Q Business, Amazon Q crawls ACL information attached to a document (user and group
information) from your SharePoint (Online) instance. If you choose to activate ACL
crawling, the information can be used to filter chat responses to your end user's
document access level.

To filter using a username, use the **User principal name** from your
Azure portal. For example, johnstiles@amazonq.onmicrosoft.com.

When you use a SharePoint group for user context filtering, calculate
the group ID as follows:

**For local groups**

1. Get the site name. For example,
    `https://host.onmicrosoft.com/sites/siteName.`

2. Take the SHA256 hash of the site name. For example,
    `430a6b90503eef95c89295c8999c7981`.

3. Create the group ID by concatenating the SHA256 hash with a vertical bar ( \| )
    and the group name. For example, if the group name is "local group name", the
    group ID is the following:

`"430a6b90503eef95c89295c8999c7981 | localGroupName"`
    (with a space before and after the vertical bar).

**For Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) groups**

1. You must integrate the Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) with Amazon Identity Center and use the same
    group name present on Azure portal.
