# Sharing Amazon Q Apps
<a name="qapps-private-sharing"></a>

Amazon Q Apps allows you to privately share your Q Apps with specific users within your Q Business application environment. This private sharing capability enables app creators to restrict app access to select users, providing more granular control over app visibility and usage within organizations.

## Benefits
<a name="w2aac31c41c43b9"></a>
+ **Controlled Access**: Share your Q Apps with only the intended users, maintaining privacy and security.
+ **Run-Only Mode**: Shared users can view and run the Q App but cannot make structural changes. To make structural changes, they will first need to duplicate it, which creates their separate, editable copy of the Q App.

## Key Concepts
<a name="w2aac31c41c43c13"></a>
+ Owner: The owner is the user who creates and has full editing rights over the Q App. As the owner, you can:
  + Privately share the Q App with other users by full email address.
  + Revoke access for shared users.
  + Edit the category for the shared Q App, which affects where it appears in the shared app user's library.
+  App User: A shared app user is a user within your organization's Q Business environment that the owner has shared the Q App with by email. As a shared user, you can:
  + View and run the shared Q App.
  + Duplicate the Q App to create an editable version.
  + Cannot directly edit the original shared Q App.

Shared users do not receive a notification when a Q App is shared with them. You need to send them the link from the share modal.

## Prerequisites for Private Sharing
<a name="w2aac31c41c43c17"></a>

 Before your web experience users can use sharing you will need to update the web experience IAM role to enable private sharing in the web experience. We recommend updating the `DescribeQAppPermissions` `UpdateQAppPermissions` statement of the IAM policy attached to this role to include the action as follows:

```
{
    "Sid": "QAppsAppOwnerPermissions",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "qapps:GetQApp",
        "qapps:CopyQApp",
        "qapps:UpdateQApp",
        "qapps:DeleteQApp",
        "qapps:ImportDocument",
        "qapps:ImportDocumentToQApp",
        "qapps:CreateLibraryItem",
        "qapps:UpdateLibraryItem",
        "qapps:StartQAppSession",
        "qapps:DescribeQAppPermissions",
        "qapps:UpdateQAppPermissions"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:qapps:{{region}}:{{source_account}}:application/{{application_id}}/qapp/*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringEqualsIgnoreCase": {
            "qapps:UserIsAppOwner": "true"
        }
    }
}

{
    "Sid": "QAppsPublishedAppPermissions",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "qapps:GetQApp",
        "qapps:CopyQApp",
        "qapps:AssociateQAppWithUser",
        "qapps:GetLibraryItem",
        "qapps:CreateLibraryItemReview",
        "qapps:AssociateLibraryItemReview",
        "qapps:DisassociateLibraryItemReview",
        "qapps:StartQAppSession",
        "qapps:DescribeQAppPermissions"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:qapps:{{region}}:{{source_account}}:application/{{application_id}}/qapp/*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringEqualsIgnoreCase": {
            "qapps:AppIsPublished": "true"
        }
    }
}
```

### Sharing Amazon Q Apps

------
#### [ Web Experience ]

**To privately share your Q App**

1. Open the Q App you want to share.

1. Choose on the "Share" button in the top right corner.

1. In the share modal, enter the email addresses of the users you want to share with, or you can toggle ‘Share with all’ to give access to everyone in your Q Apps organization.

1. Edit the category(s) for the shared Q App, which affects where it appears in the shared user's library.

1. (Optional) Choose the copy icon to obtain the link; this can then be sent to shared users via your preferred method (e.g., email or Slack).

1. Choose "Share" to complete the sharing process.

The shared users will now be able to access and run your Q App from the library or via the shareable link you provide them.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

 To privately share your Q App with AWS CLI, use the `DescribeQAppPermissions` command.

aws qapps describe-q-app-permissions \
            --instance-id {{instanceId}} \
            --app-id {{appId}}
