# Example IAM policies for Amazon Q Business application environment supporting anonymous access
<a name="anonymous-application-iam-policies"></a>

We strongly recommend that you use a restricted policies for the role that will be used to call the chat APIs for anonymous access application environments.

You need permission policies to use Amazon Q Business application environments that support anonymous access. The following are examples of such restricted policies.

**Topics**
+ [Policy for calling relevant APIs](#anonymous-application-iam-policies-api)
+ [Policies for using the web experience](#anonymous-application-iam-policies-web-experience)

## Policy for calling relevant APIs
<a name="anonymous-application-iam-policies-api"></a>

**Example policy to allow the Amazon Q Business APIs for anonymous access**

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",		 	 	 ,
    "Statement": [{
            "Sid": "QBusinessAnonymousConversationAPIPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "qbusiness:Chat",
                "qbusiness:ChatSync",
                "qbusiness:PutFeedback"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:qbusiness:{{region}}:{{account_id}}:application/{{application_id}}"
        }]
}
```

**Applying your restricted policies to an IAM role for using APIs for Amazon Q application environments supporting anonymous access**

1. Create a directory named *policies*.

1. In that directory, create and save a file named *permspolicyforAPIanonymous.json* with the JSON for allowing Amazon Q Business API calls for anonymous access.

1. Finally, create and attach the policy using the following commands in the AWS CLI.

   **Create and attach policy**

   ```
   aws iam \
   create-role \
   --policy-document file://policies/permspolicyforAPIanonymous.json
   ```

## Policies for using the web experience
<a name="anonymous-application-iam-policies-web-experience"></a>

**Example policy to allow the Amazon Q Business web experience for anonymous access**

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",		 	 	 ,
    "Statement": [{
            "Sid": "QBusinessAnonymousWebExperienceConversationPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "qbusiness:Chat",
                "qbusiness:ChatSync",
                "qbusiness:PutFeedback",
                "qbusiness:GetChatControlsConfiguration",
                "qbusiness:GetApplication",
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:qbusiness:{{region}}:{{account_id}}:application/{{application_id}}"
        }]
}
```

**Example trust policy to allow the Amazon Q Business web experience for anonymous access**

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",		 	 	 ,
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "QBusinessTrustPolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "application.qbusiness.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": [
                "sts:AssumeRole"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceAccount": "{{account_id}}"
                },
                "ArnEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:qbusiness:{{region}}:{{account_id}}:application/{{application_id}}"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

**Applying your restricted policies for using the web experience to an IAM role**

1. Create a directory named *policies*.

1. Then, in the same directory, create and save a file named *permspolicyforwebexperienceanonymous* with the JSON for allowing the Amazon Q Business web experience for anonymous access.

1. Then, in the same directory, create and save a file named *trustpolicyforanonymous.json* with the JSON for the trust policy to allow the Amazon Q Business web experience for anonymous access

1. Finally, create and attach the policies using the following commands in the AWS CLI.

   **Create and attach policy**

   ```
   aws iam \
   create-role \
   --role-name --assume-role-policy-document file://policies/trustpolicyforanonymous.json \
   --policy-document file://policies/permspolicyforwebexperienceanonymous.json
   ```
**Note**
For the web experience to work properly with AWS CLI commands both policies are needed

**Amazon Q also supports using a service-linked role (`AWSServiceRoleForQBusiness`) for an Amazon Q application environment. The following is the service-linked role policy:**

                "cloudwatch:PutMetricData"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",

                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "QBusinessCreateLogGroupPermission",

            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:/aws/qbusiness/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "QBusinessDescribeLogGroupsPermission",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:DescribeLogGroups"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "QBusinessLogStreamPermission",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:/aws/qbusiness/*:log-stream:*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
