# Example IAM policies for Amazon Q Business application environment supporting anonymous access

We strongly recommend that you use a restricted policies for the role that will be
used to call the chat APIs for anonymous access application environments.

You need permission policies to use Amazon Q Business application environments that
support anonymous access. The following are examples of such restricted
policies.

## Policy for calling relevant APIs

###### Example policy to allow the Amazon Q Business APIs for anonymous access

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",,
    "Statement": [{
            "Sid": "QBusinessAnonymousConversationAPIPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "qbusiness:Chat",
                "qbusiness:ChatSync",
                "qbusiness:PutFeedback"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:qbusiness:{{region}}:{{account_id}}:application/{{application_id}}"
        }]
}
```

###### Applying your restricted policies to an IAM role for using APIs for Amazon Q application environments supporting anonymous access

1. Create a directory named _policies_.

2. In that directory, create and save a file named
    _permspolicyforAPIanonymous.json_ with the JSON
    for allowing Amazon Q Business API calls for anonymous
    access.

3. Finally, create and attach the policy using the following commands in
    the AWS CLI.

**Create and attach policy**

```nohighlight

aws iam \
create-role \
   --policy-document file://policies/permspolicyforAPIanonymous.json
```

## Policies for using the web experience

###### Example policy to allow the Amazon Q Business web experience for anonymous access

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",,
    "Statement": [{
            "Sid": "QBusinessAnonymousWebExperienceConversationPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "qbusiness:Chat",
                "qbusiness:ChatSync",
                "qbusiness:PutFeedback",
                "qbusiness:GetChatControlsConfiguration",
                "qbusiness:GetApplication",
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:qbusiness:{{region}}:{{account_id}}:application/{{application_id}}"
        }]
}
```

###### Example trust policy to allow the Amazon Q Business web experience for anonymous access

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",,
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "QBusinessTrustPolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "application.qbusiness.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": [
                "sts:AssumeRole"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceAccount": "{{account_id}}"
                },
                "ArnEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:qbusiness:{{region}}:{{account_id}}:application/{{application_id}}"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

###### Applying your restricted policies for using the web experience to an IAM role

1. Create a directory named _policies_.

2. Then, in the same directory, create and save a file named
    _permspolicyforwebexperienceanonymous_ with the
    JSON for allowing the Amazon Q Business web experience for
    anonymous access.

3. Then, in the same directory, create and save a file named
    _trustpolicyforanonymous.json_ with the JSON for
    the trust policy to allow the Amazon Q Business web experience for
    anonymous access

4. Finally, create and attach the policies using the following commands
    in the AWS CLI.

**Create and attach policy**

```nohighlight

aws iam \
create-role \
   --role-name --assume-role-policy-document file://policies/trustpolicyforanonymous.json \
   --policy-document file://policies/permspolicyforwebexperienceanonymous.json
```

###### Note

For the web experience to work properly with AWS CLI commands both
policies are needed

**Amazon Q also supports using a service-linked role**
**( `AWSServiceRoleForQBusiness`) for an Amazon Q application environment.**
**The following is the service-linked role policy:**

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "QBusinessPutMetricDataPermission",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudwatch:PutMetricData"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "cloudwatch:namespace": "AWS/QBusiness"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "QBusinessCreateLogGroupPermission",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:/aws/qbusiness/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "QBusinessDescribeLogGroupsPermission",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:DescribeLogGroups"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "QBusinessLogStreamPermission",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:/aws/qbusiness/*:log-stream:*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```
