# Connecting Amazon Q Business to GitHub (Server) using the console

The following procedure outlines how to connect Amazon Q Business to
GitHub (Server) using the AWS Management Console.

###### Connecting Amazon Q to GitHub (Server)

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business
     console.

02. From the left navigation menu, choose **Data**
    **sources**.

03. From the **Data sources** page, choose
     **Add data source**.

04. Then, on the **Add data sources** page, from
     **Data sources**, add the **GitHub** data source to your Amazon Q application.

05. Then, on the **GitHub (Server)** data source page, enter
     the following information:

06. **Name and description**, do the following:

- For **Data source name** – Name your data
source for easy tracking.

###### Note

You can include hyphens (-) but
not spaces. Maximum of 1,000 alphanumeric characters.

- **Description –**
**_optional_** – Add an optional
description for your data source. This text is viewed only by Amazon Q Business administrators and can be edited later.

07. **Source** – Choose your GitHub (Server) source
     details.
    1. **GitHub (Server) source** – Choose
        GitHub (Server) Enterprise Cloud.

    2. **GitHub (Server) host URL** – Enter the
        GitHub (Server) host name with the protocol (http:// or https://).
        For example:
        `https://on-prem-host-url/api/v3/`.

    3. **GitHub (Server) organization name** – You
        can find your organization name when you log in to GitHub (Server)
        desktop and go to **Your organizations** under your
        profile picture dropdown.

    4. **SSL certificate location**— Enter the path
        to the SSL certificate stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. You use
        this to connect to Github (Server) with a secure SSL
        connection.
08. **Authorization** – Amazon Q Business crawls ACL information by default to ensure responses are generated only from
     documents your end users have access to. If supported for your connector, you can manage ACLs by selecting **Enable ACLs** to enable ACLs or **Disable ACLs** to disable them.
     To manage ACLs, you need specific IAM permissions. See [Grant permission to create data sources with ACLs disabled](setting-up.md#DisableAclOnDataSource) for more details.

     See [Authorization](connector-concepts.md#connector-authorization) for more details.

09. **Authentication** – Enter the following information
     for your **AWS Secrets Manager secret**.
    1. **Secret name** – A name for your
        secret.

    2. **GitHub (Server) token** – Enter the
        access token you created in GitHub.
10. **Configure VPC and security group –**
    **_optional_** – Choose
     whether you want to use a VPC. If you do, enter the following
     information:

    1. **Subnets** – Select up to 6
        repository subnets that define the subnets and IP ranges
        the repository instance uses in the selected VPC.

    2. **VPC security groups** –
        Choose up to 10 security groups that allow access to
        your data source. Ensure that the security group allows
        incoming traffic from Amazon EC2 instances and
        devices outside your VPC. For databases, security group
        instances are required.

For more information, see [VPC](connector-concepts.md#connector-vpc).

11. **IAM role** – Choose
     an existing IAM role or create an IAM role to access your repository credentials and
     index content.

    ###### Note

    Creating a new service IAM role is recommended.

    For more information, see [IAM role](github-server-connector.md#github-server-iam).

12. In **Sync scope**, enter the following information:
    1. **Select repositories to crawl**—Select
        between crawling **All** repositories or
        **Select repositories**.

       If you choose **Select repositories**, add names for
        the repositories in **Name of repository** and,
        optionally, the name of any specific branches in **Name of**
       **branch**.

    2. For **Maximum file size** – Specify the file
        size limit in MBs that Amazon Q will crawl. Amazon Q will crawl only
        the files within the size limit you define. The default file size is
        50MB. The maximum file size should be greater than 0MB and less than or
        equal to 50MB.

    3. **Additional configuration –**
       **_optional_** – Configure the
        following settings:

- **Content types** – Select the file
types you want to include. You can choose from the following
options: **All**, **Files**,
**Issues**, **Issue**
**comments**, **Issue comment**
**attachments**, **Pull request comment**
**attachments**, **Pull requests**,
and **Pull request comments**.

- **Regex patterns** – Regular
expression patterns to include or exclude certain files. You can
add up to 100 patterns.

    4. **Advanced settings**

       **Document deletion safeguard** \- _optional_–To safeguard
        your documents from deletion during a sync job, select **On** and enter an integer between 0 - 100. If
        the percentage of documents to be deleted in your sync job exceeds the percentage you selected, the
        delete phase will be skipped and no documents from this data source will be deleted from your index. For more information, see
        [Document deletion safeguard](connector-concepts.md#document-deletion-safeguard).
13. In **Sync mode**, choose how you
     want to update your index when your data source
     content changes. When you sync your data source with
     Amazon Q for the first time, all content
     is synced by default.

- **Full sync** – Sync
all content regardless of the previous sync
status.

- **New or modified content**
**sync** – Sync only new and modified
documents.

- **New, modified, or deleted**
**content sync** – Sync only new,
modified, and deleted documents.

For more details, see [Sync mode](connector-concepts.md#connector-sync-mode).

14. In **Sync run schedule**, for
     **Frequency** – Choose how often
     Amazon Q will sync with your data
     source. For more details, see [Sync run schedule](connector-concepts.md#connector-sync-run). To learn how to start a data sync job,
     see [Starting data source connector sync jobs](supported-datasource-actions.md#start-datasource-sync-jobs).

15. **Tags - _optional_** –
     Add tags to search and filter your resources or track your AWS costs. See [Tags](tagging.md) for more details.

16. **Field mappings** – A list of data source document
     attributes to map to your index fields.

    ###### Note

    Add or update the fields from the **Data**
    **source details** page after you finish adding your data source.

    You can choose from two types of fields:

    1. **Default** – Automatically created by
        Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
        can't edit these.

    2. **Custom** – Automatically created by
        Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
        can edit these. You can also create and add new custom fields.

       ###### Note

       Support for adding custom fields varies by connector. You
       won't see the **Add field** option if your
       connector doesn't support adding custom fields.

For more information, see [Field mappings](connector-concepts.md#connector-field-mappings).

17. In **Data source details**, choose **Sync**
    **now** to allow Amazon Q to begin syncing (crawling and
     ingesting) data from your data source. When the sync job finishes, your data
     source is ready to use.

    ###### Note

    View CloudWatch logs for your data source sync job by selecting **View**
    **CloudWatch logs**. If you encounter a `Resource not found
                                exception` error, wait and try again as logs may not be available
    immediately.

    You can also view a detailed document-level report by selecting
    **View Report**. This report shows the status of each
    document during the crawl, sync, and index stages, including any errors. If
    the report is empty for an in-progress job, check back later as data is
    emitted to the report as events occur during the sync process.

    For more information, see [Troubleshooting data source\
    connectors](troubleshooting-data-sources.md#troubleshooting-data-sources-not-indexed).
