# Creating an Amazon Q Business application using IAM federation through Microsoft Entra ID

As the first step toward creating a generative artificial intelligence (AI) assistant,
configure your external identity provider and connect it to AWS Identity and Access Management.

When you create an application environment, you can also choose to create an Amazon Q Business web experience, which your end users can use to chat with your
application. You can add subscriptions for end users who log in to your Amazon Q Business web experience using Microsoft Entra ID. Any user
logging in to your web experience is automatically provisioned with a subscription of a
type that you select for them.

###### Note

As of Oct 31, 2024, once you have created a new Amazon Q Business
application environment, the default web experience will allow users to interact directly with the
LLM to get answers from its general knowledge or uploaded file content, even if the Admin has not yet connected any enterprise data sources.

For existing application environments, the _Allow direct access to LLM_
setting will remain as previously configured. For new application environments, the
_Allow direct access to LLM_ setting will be enabled by default,
though Admins can still disable this if desired.

To learn more about identity federation using AWS Identity and Access Management, see the following
topics:

- [Identity federation\
in AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/identity/federation) on the _AWS website_.

- [Providing access to externally authenticated users\
(identity federation)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_federated-users.html) in the _IAM User_
_Guide_.

The following steps show how to integrate Amazon Q Business with
Microsoft Entra ID. Integrating Amazon Q Business with
Microsoft Entra ID requires that you switch between tasks on the
Amazon Q Business console and the Microsoft Entra ID admin
portal.

## Prerequisites

Before you start to integrate Amazon Q Business with Microsoft Entra
ID, make sure that you have:

- Created a Microsoft Entra ID account and added at least one
user with a valid email address. For more information, see [Add\
users in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/add-users) on the
_Microsoft Learn website_.

- Appropriate permissions in Microsoft Entra ID to create and
configure enterprise applications. Review the [Microsoft Entra ID built-in roles\
documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference) to ensure you have the required permissions.
Typically, you need the `Application Administrator` or
`Cloud Application Administrator` role.

- Created IAM policies containing the permissions outlined in [IAM role for an Amazon Q Business web\
experience using IAM Federation](web-experience-iam-role-iam.md) to:

- Allow an Amazon Q Business web experience to invoke the API
operations required to integrate your application

- **(If you're creating a Amazon Q Business default web experience)** Allow Amazon Q Business to access the resources it needs to create a web
experience

You will need these roles to complete creating your Amazon Q Business IAM federated application.

###### Note

To create a new policy, follow the instructions in [Creating\
IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.

- (Optional) Checked [how subscriptions work](tiers.md#managing-sub-tiers-iam) for Amazon Q Business applications using IAM Federation.

## Step 1: Create and configure a Microsoft Entra ID application

This procedure outlines how to create and configure a Microsoft Entra
ID instance for an Amazon Q Business application using a built-in
web experience and a custom Amazon Q Business application client you develop
using Amazon Q Business APIs.

###### Important

Amazon Q Business supports Microsoft Entra ID with SAML
2.0 only. OIDC is not supported for Microsoft Entra ID.

###### To create a Microsoft Entra ID instance

1. Sign into the Microsoft Entra admin center in your
    Microsoft Azure Portal.

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Enterprise**
**apps**.

3. From **All applications**, choose **\+ New**
**application** from the top navigation pane.

4. On the **Browse Microsoft Entra gallery** page, choose
    **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, and then select
    **AWS Single-Account Access**.

5. Then, in the **AWS Single-Account Access** menu that
    opens, in **Name**, add a name for your application. For
    example: `QBusinessSAMLProvider`. Then, select
    **Create**.

6. When the application is ready, on the **Overview** page
    of your application, from **Getting Started** choose
    **Single sign-on**.

7. On the **Single sign-on** page, for **Select a**
**single sign-on method**, select
    **SAML**.

Selecting SAML configures the application to use Security Assertion Markup
    Language (SAML) 2.0 for authentication, which is the protocol required for
    IAM federation with AWS services like Amazon Q Business.

8. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, for
    **Basic SAML Configuration**, choose
    **Edit**, and then configure the following
    settings:

- For **Identifier (Entity ID)**, enter your web
application endpoint.

If you're creating an Amazon Q Business application
generated web experience endpoint URL, this value be the Amazon Q Business generated web experience URL with
`saml` added at the end. For example,
`https://abcdefgh.qbusiness.us-east-1.on.aws/saml`.
The web experience URL will be generated by Amazon Q Business
after you finish creating an Amazon Q Business application.
For now, enter a placeholder URL. For example:
`https://sampleurl.com`. You will
update this at the end of your Amazon Q Business application
creation process.

- For **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service**
**URL)** – Enter your web application
endpoint.

If you're creating an Amazon Q Business application
generated web experience endpoint URL, this value be the Amazon Q Business generated web experience URL with
`saml` added at the end. For example,
`https://abcdefgh.qbusiness.us-east-1.on.aws/saml`.
The web experience URL will be generated by Amazon Q Business
after you finish creating an Amazon Q Business application.
For now, enter a placeholder URL. For example:
`https://sampleurl.com`. You will
update this at the end of your Amazon Q Business application
creation process.

- Select **Save**.

9. In the **SAML Certificates** section, download the
    **Federation Metadata XML** file. You will need this
    file when you create an identity provider in IAM.

The **Federation Metadata XML** file contains all the
    necessary SAML metadata that IAM needs to establish trust with your
    Microsoft Entra ID application, including certificate
    information, entity IDs, and endpoint URLs. This file will be uploaded to
    IAM when creating the identity provider in the next step.

You're now ready to move on to configuring AWS Identity and Access Management on the AWS Management Console.

## Step 2: Create an IAM identity provider

After you create and configure your Microsoft Entra ID application,
create an IAM identity provider.

**To connect Microsoft Entra ID to AWS Identity and Access Management**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Identity and Access Management.

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Identity providers**,
    and then choose **Add provider**.

3. For **Configure provider**, do the following:
1. For **Provider type**, choose
       **SAML**.

2. For **Provider name**, enter a name for your
       identity provider (for example,
       `EntraIDProvider`).

3. For **Metadata document**, choose
       **Choose file** and upload the
       **Federation Metadata XML** file that you
       downloaded from Microsoft Entra ID.

4. Choose **Add provider**.
4. On the **Identity provider** summary page, from
    **Provider**, select the provider you just added do the
    following:

- From **Summary** copy the
**ARN** and save the value. You will need it
when you add your IAM trust policy and when you connect your
AWS Identity and Access Management identity provider to your Microsoft Entra
ID instance. The format of the ARN is:
`arn:aws:iam::aws-account-id:saml-provider/assigned-iam-idp-name`.

- Then, select **Assign role** to create an IAM
role with the necessary permissions for your identity
provider.

5. In **Assign role**, for **Role options**
    select **Create a new role**.

6. Then, on the **Selected trusted entity** page, do the
    following:

- For **Trusted entity type** select
**Custom trust policy**.

- In **Custom trust policy**, add the following
trust policy, replacing the value for `AWS IAM
                                      Identity Provider ARN` with the identity provider
ARN you copied in the previous step:

```json

```

###### Note

Leave the `SAML:aud` field as
`https://sampleurl.com` for now.
You'll come back to update it with your Amazon Q web experience
URL as part of Step 5 of this tutorial.

Select **Next**.

7. On the **Add permissions** page, for
    **Permissions policies** choose an IAM policy with
    the required permissions and then select **Next**.

For the policy permissions required, see [IAM role for an Amazon Q Business web\
    experience using IAM Federation](web-experience-iam-role-iam.md). Optionally, select
    **AdministratorAccess**.

###### Note

To create a new policy, follow the instructions in [Creating\
IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.

8. In the **Name, review, and create** page, add a
    **Role name**, and optional role description and tags
    to identify your IAM role. Then, select **Create**
**role**.

9. From the **Roles** page, select the IAM role you just
    created. Then, from the role summary page, do the following:

- Copy the role **ARN** and save it. You will need
this information to connect your AWS Identity and Access Management identity provider
instance to Microsoft Entra ID. The format of the ARN
will be like this:
`arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/sample-role`.

You are now ready to return to Microsoft Entra ID to complete the
process of establishing a trust relationship between AWS Identity and Access Management and Microsoft
Entra ID.

## Step 3: Update your Microsoft Entra ID application with the IAM role ARN

In this step, you complete configuring the trust relationship between AWS Identity and Access Management
and Microsoft Entra ID.

11. Then, in the left navigation pane of your application, choose
     **Users and groups**, and do the following
     steps.
    1. Choose **\+ Add user/group** and select the users
        or groups you want to assign to your application, and then choose
        **Select**.

    2. Choose **Assign**.
12. Refresh your page. Then, from the left navigation pane of your
     application, choose **Manage**. Then, select **API**
    **Permissions**, and **Add a**
    **permission**.

13. In **Add a permission**. Then, on the **Request**
    **API permissions** section, do the following:
    1. Choose **APIs my organization uses** and select
        and open the Entra ID application you created.

    2. For **What type pf permissions does your application**
       **require?** – Choose **Application**
       **permissions**.

    3. In **Permissions** – Choose the app role
        permissions you created in the last step.

    4. Select **Add permissions**.
14. Then, from **Manage**, select
     **Properties** and copy and save the **User**
    **access URL** value for your application.

    You will need this value to create your Amazon Q application.

Your Entra ID setup is complete. You're now ready to begin creating
your Amazon Q Business application.

## Step 4: Create an Amazon Q Business application

After you configure Microsoft Entra ID and IAM, create an Amazon Q Business application.

**To create an Amazon Q Business**
**application**

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business
     console.

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Applications**, and then
     choose **Create application**.

03. On the **Create application** page, for **What**
    **kind of application do you want to create?**, enter the
     following information for your Amazon Q Business application:
    1. **Application name** – A name for your
        Amazon Q Business application environment for easy identification.
        This name is only visible in the AWS Management Console. The name can include
        hyphens (-), but not spaces, and can have a maximum of 1,000
        alphanumeric characters. Amazon Q Business auto-generates an
        application name for you, unless you choose to enter a custom
        name.

    2. For **User access**, choose
        **Authenticated access**.

    3. For **Outcome**, choose **Web**
       **experience**.
04. For **Access management method**, choose **AWS**
    **IAM Identity Provider**.

    Then, for **Choose an identity provider type**, choose
     **Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)**.

    For **SAML**, do the following:
    1. For **Select Identity Provider**, choose the
        identity provider you've created in AWS Identity and Access Management to use with your
        Amazon Q Business application.

    2. For **Authentication URL**, provide the
        authentication URL for Entra ID. Your authentication
        URL must be of the following format:
        `https://myapps.microsoft.com/signin/app_name/user_access_url_suffix`.

       For the `user_access_url_suffix`, copy the value of
        everything after `https://myapps.microsoft.com/signin/`
        from the **User access URL** you copied and saved
        in the last step.

       When end users navigate to the web experience URL they're
        redirected to this authentication URL where they provide their login
        ID and password. After successful authentication, they're redirected
        back to the web experience URL to begin chatting.
05. For **Default subscription settings**, for
     **Subscription tier**, choose between **Q**
    **Business Pro** and **Q Business Lite**. Any
     user logging in to your web experience will be assigned this subscription
     type by default.

06. For **Application details** – Amazon Q Business chooses the following configuration settings for your
     application by default:
    1. For **Application service access** –
        Amazon Q Business will create a new service-linked role
        for your application.

    2. **Encryption** – Amazon Q Business
        will create an AWS owned AWS KMS key to encrypt your data.

    3. For **Web experience service access** – If
        you've chosen to create a web experience, Amazon Q Business
        requires you select an existing role to allow end users to log in to
        a Amazon Q Business web experience.
07. (Optional) To customize **Application details**, expand
     the **Application details section**, and then do the
     following:
    1. In **Application service access**, for
        **Choose a method to authorize Amazon Q Business**, choose from the following options:
       1. **Create and use a new service-linked role**
          **(SLR)** – Create and use a new Amazon Q Business-managed IAM role to allow it to access
           the AWS resources it needs to create your
           application.

       2. **Create and use a new service role**
          **(SR)** – Create and use a new IAM role for Amazon Q Business to allow it
           to access the AWS resources it needs to
           create your application.

          For **Service role name** – A name
           for the service (IAM) role you created for
           easy identification on the console.

       3. **Use an existing service role (SR)/service-linked**
          **role (SLR)** – Use an existing service
           role or service-linked IAM role to allow
           Amazon Q Business to access the AWS
           resources it needs to create your application.

          ###### Note

          For more information about example service roles, see
          [IAM role for an Amazon Q Business application](create-application-iam-role.md). For
          information on service-linked roles, including to manage
          them, see [Using service-linked\
          roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/business-use-dg/using-service-linked-roles.html).
    2. For **Encryption** – Amazon Q Business encrypts your data by default using AWS managed AWS KMS keys. To customize your encryption settings, select
        **Customize encryption settings (advanced)**.
        Then, you can choose to use an existing AWS KMS key or
        create a new one.

    3. In **Web experience service access**, enter the
        following information:
       1. For **Choose a method to authorize Amazon Q Business** – A service access
           role assumed by end users when they sign in to your web
           experience that grants them permission to start and manage
           conversations Amazon Q Business. Choose the IAM role
           you created in Step 2.
08. To start creating your application, choose
     **Create**.

    ###### Note

    If you're creating a web experience, you can also choose to create
    your application and [view your web experience](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/customizing-web-experience-iam.html) by selecting
    **Create and open web experience**.

09. Once the application creation process completes, the web experience
     settings section on your application summary page will display your Amazon Q Business web experience URL. Copy the URL to a file and add
     `/saml` at the end of the web experience URL.

10. Then, open IAM on the AWS Management Console, and do the following:
    1. From the left navigation menu, for **Access**
       **management**, choose **Roles**, and
        then choose the IAM role you created in Step 2 of this tutorial.

    2. From the role summary page, select **Trust**
       **relationships**, and then select **Edit trust**
       **policy**.

    3. Replace the placeholder
        `{{https://sampleurl.com}}`
        with the Amazon Q web application URL you copied in the previous
        step.

    4. Select **Update policy**.

You've finished configuring your Amazon Q Business application. You're now
ready to return to Entra ID to make the final changes needed to
successfully launch your web experience application.

## Step 5: Update your Microsoft Entra ID application with the web experience URL

After you create your Amazon Q Business application and web experience,
update your Microsoft Entra ID application with the web experience
URL.

Return to the Entra ID console, edit the Basic SAML
Configuration of your Entra ID application to update the
**Identifier (Entity ID)** and **Reply URL (Assertion**
**Consumer Service URL)** you added in Step 1 to your web experience URL.
Remember to save your changes.

**To update your Microsoft Entra ID**
**application**

1. Return to the Microsoft Entra admin center and navigate to
    your application.

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Single**
**sign-on**.

3. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, choose
    **Edit**.

4. Update the following fields with your Amazon Q Business web
    experience URL:
1. For **Identifier (Entity ID)**,replace
       `https://sampleurl.com` with your web
       experience URL with the `/saml` suffix added. For
       example:
       `https://abcdefgh.qbusiness.us-east-1.on.aws/saml`.

2. For **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service**
      **URL)**, replace
       `https://sampleurl.com` with your web
       experience URL with `/saml` added at the end. For
       example:
       `https://abcdefgh.qbusiness.us-east-1.on.aws/saml`.
5. Choose **Save**.

You've finished configuring your Amazon Q Business for chat. Your authenticated end users
can now log in and chat with your web experience.

## Troubleshooting Microsoft Entra ID integration

If you encounter issues with your Microsoft Entra ID integration,
check the following:

**SAML assertion validation errors**

If you receive errors about invalid SAML assertions, verify
that:

- The **Identifier (Entity ID)** is set to
`https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml`.

- The **Reply URL** ends with
`/saml` and matches your web experience URL
exactly.

- All three required SAML attributes are correctly configured:
`Role`, `RoleSessionName`, and
`PrincipalTag:Email`.

**Access denied errors**

If users receive access denied errors when trying to access the
Amazon Q Business web experience, check that:

- The IAM role ARN and identity provider ARN in the
`Role` attribute are correct and separated by a
comma.

- The IAM role has the necessary permissions for Amazon Q Business web experience access.

- The trust relationship in the IAM role is correctly configured
to trust the SAML identity provider.

**User not provisioned errors**

If users receive errors about not being provisioned in Amazon Q Business, verify that:

- The `PrincipalTag:Email` attribute is correctly
configured to use `user.mail`.

- The user has a valid email address in Microsoft Entra
ID.

- The default subscription tier is correctly set in the Amazon Q Business application.

**Testing SAML configuration**

To test your SAML configuration:

1. In the Microsoft Entra admin center, navigate
    to your application.

2. Choose **Single sign-on**, then scroll down
    to **Test single sign-on with <application**
**name>**.

3. Choose **Test** to sign in as the current
    user, or choose **Test as another user** to
    sign in as a different user.

4. If the test is successful, you'll be redirected to your
    Amazon Q Business web experience.

For SAML assertion validation errors, access denied errors, and user not
provisioned errors, you'll need to check the Microsoft Entra ID
configuration in the admin portal as described in the Console tab.

For more information about SAML federation with Microsoft Entra ID,
see [Set up SAML-based single sign-on](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-setup-sso) in the Microsoft Entra
documentation.
