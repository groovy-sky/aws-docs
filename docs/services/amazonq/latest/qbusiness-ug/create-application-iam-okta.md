# Creating an Amazon Q Business application using IAM Federation through Okta

As the first step toward creating a generative artificial intelligence (AI) assistant,
configure your external identity provider and connect it to AWS Identity and Access Management.

When you create an application environment, you can also choose to create an Amazon Q Business web experience, which your end users can use to chat with your
application. You can also add subscriptions for end users who log in to your Amazon Q Business web experience using Okta. Any user logging in to
your web experience is automatically provisioned with a subscription of a type that you
select for them.

###### Note

As of Oct 31, 2024, once you have created a new Amazon Q Business
application environment, the default web experience will allow users to interact directly with the
LLM to get answers from its general knowledge or uploaded file content, even if the Admin has not yet connected any enterprise data sources.

For existing application environments, the _Allow direct access to LLM_
setting will remain as previously configured. For new application environments, the
_Allow direct access to LLM_ setting will be enabled by default,
though Admins can still disable this if desired.

To learn more about identity federation using AWS Identity and Access Management, see the following
topics:

- [Identity federation\
in AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/identity/federation) on the _AWS website_.

- [Providing access to externally authenticated users\
(identity federation)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_federated-users.html) in the _IAM User_
_Guide_.

The following steps show how to integrate Amazon Q Business with
Okta as an example. Integrating Amazon Q Business with
Okta requires that you switch between tasks on the Amazon Q Business console and the Okta admin console.

- [Step 2: Add an identity provider in IAM](#create-iam-app-okta-2)

- [Step 3: Connect IAM to Okta](#create-iam-app-okta-3)

- [Step 4: Create Amazon Q Business application](#create-iam-app-okta-saml-4)

## Prerequisites

Before you start to integrate Amazon Q Business with Okta,
make sure that you have:

- Created an Okta account and added at least one user with a
valid email address. For more information, see [Manage users](https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-people.htm) on the _Okta Help_
_Center_.

- Created IAM policies containing the permissions outlined in [IAM role for an Amazon Q Business web\
experience using IAM Federation](web-experience-iam-role-iam.md) to:

- Allow an Amazon Q Business web experience to invoke the API
operations required to integrate your application

- (If you're creating a Amazon Q Business default web
experience) Allow Amazon Q Business to access the resources it
needs to create a web experience

- (If you're using OIDC) Allow an Amazon Q Business web
experience to invoke the API operations required to decrypt the
Secrets Manager secret you created for your OIDC web experience

You will need these roles to complete creating your Amazon Q Business IAM federated application.

###### Note

To create a new policy, follow the instructions in [Creating\
IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.

- (Optional) Checked [how subscriptions work](tiers.md#managing-sub-tiers-iam) for Amazon Q Business applications using IAM Federation.

## Step 1: Create and configure an Okta application

This procedure outlines how to create and configure an Okta
instance for an Amazon Q Business application using a built-in web experience
and a custom Amazon Q Business application client you develop using Amazon Q Business APIs.

###### Important

Amazon Q Business supports Microsoft Entra ID with SAML
2.0, but doesn't support OIDC for Google or Microsoft
Entra ID.

SAML

**To create an Okta instance**

1. Sign into Okta and go to the admin
    console.

2. In the left navigation pane, choose
    **Applications**, and then choose
    **Create App Integration**.

3. On the **Create a new app integration** page,
    choose **SAML 2.0** and then choose
    **Next**.

4. On the **Create SAML Integration** page, in
    **General Settings**, for **App**
**name**, enter a name for the application and choose
    **Next**.

5. In **Configure SAML**, do the
    following:
1. For **Single sign-on URL**, enter
       your web application endpoint.

      If you're creating a custom Amazon Q Business
       application, this value is the endpoint URL of your
       Amazon Q Business application with
       `/saml` added at the end. For example
       `http://localhost:8000/saml`.

      If you're creating an Amazon Q Business
       application generated web experience endpoint URL, this
       value be the Amazon Q Business generated web
       experience URL with `saml` added at the end.
       For example,
       `https://abcdefgh.qbusiness.us-east-1.on.aws/saml`.

      ###### Important

      If you're creating an Amazon Q Business
      application generated web experience endpoint URL, a
      web experience URL will be generated by Amazon Q Business after you finish creating an
      Amazon Q Business application. For now,
      enter a placeholder URL. For example:
      `http://sampleurl.com`.
      You will update this at the end of your Amazon Q Business application creation
      process.

2. Deselect the **Use this for Recipient URL and**
      **Destination URL** box.

3. Then, for the **Recipient URL**
       field, enter the following AWS endpoint:
       `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml`.

4. For **Destination URL**, enter your
       web application endpoint.

      If you're creating a custom Amazon Q Business
       application, this value is the endpoint URL of your
       Amazon Q Business application with
       `/saml` added at the end. For example
       `http://localhost:8000/saml`.

      If you're creating an Amazon Q Business
       application generated web experience endpoint URL, this
       value be the Amazon Q Business generated web
       experience URL with `saml` added at the end.
       For example,
       `https://abcdefgh.qbusiness.us-east-1.on.aws/saml`.

      If you're creating an Amazon Q Business
       application generated web experience endpoint URL, a web
       experience URL will be generated by Amazon Q Business after you finish creating an Amazon Q Business application. For now, enter a
       placeholder URL. For example:
       `http://sampleurl.com`. You
       will update this at the end of your Amazon Q Business application creation process.

5. For **Audience URI (SP Identity**
      **ID)**, enter the following AWS endpoint:
       `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml`.

6. For **Name ID format**, set to
       **Persistent**.

7. The, scroll down to the bottom of the page and select
       **Next**.
6. On the Create SAML Integration page, select the
    option that best fits your use case and then select
    **Finish**. You will be redirected to the
    application summary page.

7. On the application summary page, from the top navigation menu,
    select **Assignments**, and then select
    **Assign**. Then, complete the following
    steps:
1. To assign users to your Okta app,
       choose between **Assign to People** and
       **Assign to Groups**.

2. In the dialog box that opens up, locate the users or
       groups you want to assign to your application and then
       select **Assign**.

3. Then, choose **Done**.
8. Next, you download the SAML payload and copy your
    **Sign on URL**.

You need to provide the SAML payload when you create an
    identity provider in IAM.

If you choose to create a web experience from the Amazon Q Business console (Step 4 of this page), you input the
    **Sign on URL** or **Single Sign-On**
**URL** (the URL where users sign in to access an
    application integrated with an identity provider) as the
    **Authentication URL**. The standard
    authentication URL format for Okta is:
    `https://<sub_domain>.okta.com/app/<app_name>/<app_id>/sso/saml`.

From the top navigation menu of your application home page,
    select **Sign On**. Then, complete the
    following steps:
1. In the **Settings**, from the
       **SAML 2.0** section, from
       **Metadata details** section, to
       copy the metadata file XML file by choosing
       **Copy**. Then, save it in
       `.xml` format.

      ###### Note

      You can also navigate to the metadata URL and copy
      the network response payload and paste it in a file
      that you save in `.xml` format.

       For more information, see [Create SAML app integrations](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_App_Integration_Wizard_SAML.htm) on the
       _Okta Help_
      _Center_ website.

2. Then, from **Sign on URL**, select
       the **Copy** icon to copy the Sign on
       URL. Save it in a text editor of your choice.

OIDC

**To create an Okta instance**

1. Sign into Okta and go to the admin
    console.

2. In the left navigation pane, choose
    **Applications**, and then choose
    **Create App Integration**.

3. On the **Create a new app integration** page,
    do the following:

- Choose **OIDC – OpenID**
**Connect**.

- Choose **Web application**.

- Then, choose **Next**.

4. On the **New Web App Integration** page, do
    the following:

- In **General Settings**, for
**App name**, enter a name for the
application.

- In **Grant type**, for **Core**
**grants**, ensure that
**Authorization Code** is
selected.

- In **Sign-in-redirect URIs**, add a
URL that Okta will send the
authentication response and ID token for the user's sign
in request.

If you're using a custom application, the value of
this URL will be
`http://localhost:8080/authorization-code/callback`,
where `http://localhost:8080` is your custom
web experience endpoint URL.

If you're creating an Amazon Q Business
application generated web experience endpoint URL, this
value will be the Amazon Q Business generated web
experience URL with
`/authorization-code/callback` added at
the end. Amazon Q Business generates this web
experience URL when you create a Amazon Q Business
application using in Step 4. For now, enter a
placeholder URL. For example:
`http://sampleurl.com/authorization-code/callback`.
You will update this after you finish creating a Amazon Q Business application by inputting your
Amazon Q Business web experience URL with
`/authorization-code/callback` added at
the end. For example,
`https://abcdefgh.qbusiness.us-east-1.on.aws/authorization-code/callback`.

- In **Assignments**, select whether to
assign the app integration to everyone in your org, only
selected group(s), or skip assignment until after app
creation.

- Then, select **Save**.

5. From the application summary page, from
    **General**, do the following:

- From **Client Credentials**, copy and
save the **Client ID**. You will input
this as the **Audience** when you
create an identity provider in AWS Identity and Access Management in the next
step.

- From **CLIENT SECRETS**, copy and
save the **Secret**. If you choose to
use an Amazon Q Business default web experience,
you will need to input this in an Secrets Manager secret when you
configure **Web experience settings**
in the Amazon Q Business console.

6. From the left navigation menu, select
    **Security**, and then select
    **API**.

7. Then, from **Authorization Servers**, do the
    following:

- Copy the **Issuer URI**, for example
`https://trial-okta-instance-id.okta.com/oauth2/default`.
You will need to input this value as the
**Provider URL** when you add your
identity provider in IAM in Step 2.

- Select **default**, and then select
**Claims**.

8. In **Claims**, select **Add**
**claim**, and then do the following:

- For **Name**, add
`https://aws.amazon.com/tags`.

- For **Include in token type**, choose
`ID token` and select
**Always**.

- For Okta, the
**Value** will be the following:
`{"principal_tags": {"Email": {user.email}
                                                  }}`. For other identity providers, use a valid
JSON object in the following format:

```

"principal_tags": {
      "Email": [email]
}
```

###### Note

To activate [Amazon Q Business\
response personalization](personalizing-chat-responses.md) for your
application, add the following optional tags:
`{"principal_tags": {"Email": {user.email},
                                                    "country": {user.city != null ? user.city :
                                                    ""}}}`. Ensure that null values aren't
passed via principal tags by using the operation
`user.$attribute != null ? user.$attribute :
                                                    ""`.

- For **Include in**, choose `Any
                                                  scope`.

- Select **Create**.

You are now ready to go to the AWS Identity and Access Management console and create an OIDC
identity provider instance.

###### Important

Amazon Q Business supports Microsoft Entra ID
with SAML 2.0, but doesn't support OIDC for Google or
Microsoft Entra ID.

You are now ready to move to the AWS Identity and Access Management console to create an identity provider
integration for your Okta instance.

## Step 2: Add an identity provider in IAM

In this step, you add configure AWS Identity and Access Management by creating an identity provider
integration for your Okta instance.

SAML

**To connect Okta to AWS Identity and Access Management**

- Select **Add provider**.

05. On the **Identity provider** summary page,
     from **Provider**, select the provider you just
     added do the following:

- From **Summary** copy the
**ARN** and save the value. You
will need it when you add your trust policy and when you
connect your AWS Identity and Access Management identity provider to your
Okta instance. The format of the ARN
is:
`arn:aws:iam::aws-account-id:saml-provider/assigned-iam-idp-name`.

- Then, select **Assign role** to
create an IAM role with the necessary permissions for
your identity provider.

06. In **Assign role**, for **Role**
    **options** select **Create a new**
    **role**.

07. Then, on the **Selected trusted entity**
     page, do the following:

- For **Trusted entity type** select
**SAML 2.0 federation**.

- In **SAML 2.0 federation**, from the
**SAML 2.0-based provider**
drop-down, select the identity provider you
added.

- For **Access to be allowed**, select

     a **Role name**, and optional role description
     and tags to identify your IAM role. Then, select
     **Create role**.

10. From the **Roles** page, select the IAM
     role you just created. Then, from the role summary page, do the
     following:

- Copy the role **ARN** and save it.
You will need this information to connect your AWS Identity and Access Management
identity provider instance to Okta. The
format of the ARN will be like this:
`arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/sample-role`.

- In **Trust relationships**, select
**Edit trust policy** and select
**Add new statement** to add the
following trust policy, replacing the value for
`account_id` with your
AWS account ID and

copied:

```json

{
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithSAML",
              "Sid": "SAMLAssumeRoleAccess",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Condition": {
                  "StringEquals": {
                      "SAML:aud": "https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml"
                  }
              },
              "Principal": {
                  "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:saml-provider/saml-provider-name"

              },
              "Principal": {
                  "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:saml-provider/saml-provider-name"
              }
          }
      ]
}

```

- Then, select **Update**
**policy**.

You are now ready to return to Okta to complete the
process of establishing a trust relationship between AWS Identity and Access Management and
Okta.

**Settings** choose **Next**.

5. In **Configure SAML**, scroll down to the
    **Attribute Statements** section, and add
    the following attributes:

**Attribute 1**

- For the **Name** field, provide the
following for the email attribute:
`https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/PrincipalTag:Email`.

- For the **Name format** field, keep
it set to **Unspecified**.

- For the **Value** field, provide a
mapping to the attribute by selecting
`user.email` from the drop-down
list.

###### Note

You can add more attributes to enable [Amazon Q Business\
response personalization](personalizing-chat-responses.md). To do this,
provide the following value for the
**Name** field:
`https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/PrincipalTag:<attributeName>`.
Keep the **Name format** field
**Unspecified**. For
**Value**, provide an attribute
mapping by selecting a user attribute like
`user.city` from the drop-down
list.

**Attribute 2**

- For the **Name** field, provide the
following name for the role attribute:
`https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/Role
                                              `.

- For the **Name format** field, keep
it set to **Unspecified**.

- For the **Value** field, add a
mapping to the attribute in the following format using
the values you copied from Step 2 of this section:
`IAMroleArn,IAMidpArn`. For example:
`arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/sample-role,arn:aws:iam::111122223333:saml-provider/okta-idp`.

**Attribute 3**

- Then, for the **Name** field, provide
the following name for the role session name attribute:
`https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/RoleSessionName`.

- For the **Name format** field, keep
it set to **Unspecified**.

- For the **Value** field, provide a
mapping to the attribute by selecting
`user.email` from the drop-down
list.

- Choose **Next**, and then choose
**Finish**.

Now, move on to the Amazon Q Business console to create your
application.

OIDC

**This step isn't needed for**
**OIDC.**

## Step 4: Create Amazon Q Business application

To create an Amazon Q Business application environment, you can use either the
AWS Management Console or the Amazon Q Business API. When you create an application,
response generation from large language model (LLM) knowledge is enabled by
default.

If you're using an Amazon Q Business default web experience for your
application, you can choose to generate it in this step. If you're using this
generated URL as your web experience endpoint, you need to return to
Okta to update your identity provider instance with this
information.

You also add subscriptions for end users logging into your Amazon Q Business
web experience using Okta. Any user logging into your web experience
is automatically provisioned a subscription of the type you select.

###### Warning

User subscriptions are connected to the AWS account Amazon Q Business
applications are attached to. If the same user logs in to an Amazon Q Business application using multiple AWS accounts, they're charged
multiple times. [Create an Amazon Q Business application using\
IAM Identity Center](create-application.md) for user management to avoid this issue.

For a consolidated view of your user subscriptions—including a list of
subscribed users, their subscription status, and applications, accounts, or services
a user can access through their subscriptions—see the [Amazon Q subscriptions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/subscriptions).
Subscriptions can only be viewed centrally and _not_ be created
or updated from the Amazon Q subscription management console.

For more information on user subscriptions for an IAM federated Amazon Q Business application, see [Subscriptions for applications using IAM\
Federation](tiers.md#managing-sub-tiers-iam).

As a prerequisite, make sure that you complete the [setting\
up](setting-up.md) tasks. If you're using the AWS CLI or the API, make sure that you
created the required [IAM roles](setting-up.md).

The following tabs provide a procedure for creating your Amazon Q Business
application environment using the AWS Management Console and code examples for using the AWS CLI.

Console

**To create an application**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business
    console.

2. On the **Create application** page, for
    **What kind of application do you want to**
**create?**, enter the following information for your
    Amazon Q Business application:
1. **Application name** – A name
       for your Amazon Q Business application environment for easy
       identification. This name is only visible in the
       AWS Management Console. The name can include hyphens (-), but not
       spaces, and can have a maximum of 1,000 alphanumeric
       characters. Amazon Q Business auto-generates an
       application name for you, unless you choose to enter a
       custom name.

2. **Outcome** – Select
       **Web experience** to create a web
       experience for your application. Amazon Q Business
       creates a web experience by default when you create an
       application. If you don't want to create a web
       experience, deselect this option.
3. For **Access management method**, choose
    **AWS IAM Identity Provider**.

Then, for **Choose an identity provider**
**type**, choose between **Security Assertion**
**Markup Language (SAML)** and **OpenID**
**Connect (OIDC)**.
1. For **SAML**, do the
       following:
      1. For **Select Identity**
         **Provider**, choose the identity provider
          you've created in AWS Identity and Access Management to use with your
          Amazon Q Business application.

      2. For **Authentication URL**,
          provide the authentication URL for
          Okta. Your authentication URL must
          be of the following format:
          `https://<sub_domain>.okta.com/app/<app_name>/<app_id>/sso/saml`.
          Enter the **Sign on URL** you
          copied in Step 1.

         When end users navigate to the web experience
          URL they're redirected to this authentication URL
          where they provide their login ID and password.
          After successful authentication, they're
          redirected back to the web experience URL to begin
          chatting.
2. For **OIDC**, do the
       following:
      1. For **Select Identity**
         **Provider**, choose the identity provider
          you've created in AWS Identity and Access Management to use with your
          Amazon Q Business application.

      2. For **ClientID for OIDC**,
          input the OIDC client ID you copied
          in Step 1.

      3. For **AWS Secrets Manager**, choose to
          create a new Secrets Manager secret or add an existing one
          to allow Amazon Q Business to access your
          Okta instance. Your secret must
          contain the client secret you copied from your
          Okta instance.

      4. In **Choose method to authorize**
         **Amazon Q Business web experience to use**
         **Secrets**, choose an existing IAM role to allow your Amazon Q Business web experience to access the
          AWS resources it needs to
          function.

         For the policy permissions required, see
          [IAM role for an Amazon Q Business web experience using IAM\
          Federation](web-experience-iam-role-iam.md).

         ###### Note

         To create a new policy, follow the
         instructions in [Creating IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) in the AWS Identity and Access Management
         User Guide.
4. For **Default subscription settings**, for
    **Subscription tier**, choose between
    **Q Business Pro** and **Q Business**
**Lite**. Any user logging in to your web experience
    will be assigned this subscription type by default.

5. For **Application details** – Amazon Q Business chooses the following configuration settings
    for your application by default:
1. For **Application service access**
       – Amazon Q Business will create a new
       service-linked role for your application.

2. **Encryption** – Amazon Q Business will create an AWS owned AWS KMS key
       to encrypt your data.

3. For **Web experience service access**
       – If you've chosen to create a web experience,
       Amazon Q Business requires you select an
       existing role to allow end users to log in to a Amazon Q Business web experience.
6. (Optional) To customize **Application**
**details**, expand the **Application details**
**section**, and then do the following:
1. In **Application service access**,
       for **Choose a method to authorize Amazon Q Business**, choose from the
       following options:
      1. **Create and use a new service-linked**
         **role (SLR)** – Create and use a
          new Amazon Q Business-managed IAM role to
          allow it to access the AWS
          resources it needs to create your
          application.

      2. **Create and use a new service role**
         **(SR)** – Create and use a new
          IAM role for Amazon Q Business to allow it to access the AWS
          resources it needs to create your
          application.

      3. **Use an existing service role**
         **(SR)/service-linked role (SLR)** –
          Use an existing service role or service-linked
          IAM role to allow Amazon Q Business to access the AWS
          resources it needs to create your
          application.

         ###### Note

         For more information about example service
         roles, see [IAM role for an Amazon Q Business application](create-application-iam-role.md). For
         information on service-linked roles, including to
         manage them, see [Using service-linked\
         roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/business-use-dg/using-service-linked-roles.html).

      4. **Service role name**
          – A name for the service (IAM) role you created for easy identification on
          the console.
2. For **Encryption** – Amazon Q Business encrypts your data by default using
       AWS managed AWS KMS keys. To customize your
       encryption settings, select **Customize**
      **encryption settings (advanced)**. Then, you
       can choose to use an existing AWS KMS key or
       create a new one.

3. In **Web experience service access**,
       enter the following information:
      1. For **Choose a method to authorize**
         **Amazon Q Business** – A
          service access role assumed by end users when they
          sign in to your web experience that grants them
          permission to start and manage conversations
          Amazon Q Business. You can only choose to
          use an existing role. For more information on how
          to create a role and permissions needed, see
          [Prerequisites for creating an\
          IAM federated application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/create-application-iam-okta.html#create-iam-app-okta-prereqs).

      2. **Service role name**
          – A name for the service role you created
          for easy identification on the console.
7. To start creating your application, choose
    **Create**.

###### Note

If you're creating a web experience, you can also choose
to create your application and [view your web experience](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/customizing-web-experience-iam.html) by
selecting **Create and open web**
**experience**.

8. Once the application creation process completes, the web
    experience settings section on your application summary page
    will display your Amazon Q Business web experience URL.
    Copy the URL to a file and then, depending on the authentication
    type you've chosen, do the following:
1. **If you're using SAML**
       – Add `/saml` at the end of the URL.
       Then, Return to the Okta console, edit
       your SAML application to update
       **Single sign-on URL** and
       **Destination URL** you added in
       Step 1 to your web experience URL. Remember to save your
       changes.

2. **If you're using OIDC**
       – Add `/authorization-code/callback`
       at the end of the URL. Then, return to the
       Okta console to edit your
       OIDC application and update the
       **Sign-in-redirect URI** value you
       added in Step 1. Remember to save your changes.
