## Prerequisites for using NTLM authentication

**If you're using NTLM authentication, make sure you've**
**completed the following steps in SharePoint Server (Subscription Edition):**

- Copied your SharePoint instance URLs. The format for the host URL you
enter is
`https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite`.
Your URL must start with `https` and contain
`sharepoint.com`.

- Copied the domain name of your SharePoint instance URL.

- Generated an SSL certificate and uploaded it to an Amazon S3 bucket.

- Noted the username and password that you use to connect to
SharePoint.

**(Optional) If you're using Email ID with Domain**
**from IDP to control access to your documents, make sure you've**
**completed the following steps:**

- Copied your LDAP Server Endpoint (endpoint of LDAP server including
protocol and port number). For example:
`ldap://example.com:389`.

- Copied your LDAP Search Base (search base of the LDAP user). For example:
`CN=Users,DC=sharepoint,DC=com`.

- Copied your LDAP username and LDAP password.

**(Optional) If using Email ID with Custom**
**Domain for access control, complete the following**
**step:**

- Noted your custom email domain value—for example:
`"amazon.com"`.

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**

- Created a Amazon Q Business application.

- Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](select-retriever.md).

- Created an [IAM role](iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.

- Stored your SharePoint Server (Subscription Edition) authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager
secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the
secret.

###### Note

If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager
secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the
console.

## Prerequisites for using Kerberos authentication

**If you're using Kerberos authentication, make sure you've**

- Generated an SSL certificate and uploaded it to an Amazon S3 bucket.

- Noted the username and password that you use to connect to
SharePoint.

**(Optional) If you're using Email ID with Domain**
**from IDP to control access to your documents, make sure you've**
**completed the following steps:**

- Copied your LDAP Server Endpoint (endpoint of LDAP server including
protocol and port number). For example:
`ldap://example.com:389`.

- Copied your LDAP Search Base (search base of the LDAP user). For example:
`CN=Users,DC=sharepoint,DC=com`.

- Copied your LDAP username and LDAP password.

**(Optional) If using Email ID with Custom**
**Domain for access control, complete the following**

- Created an [IAM role](iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.

- Stored your SharePoint Server (Subscription Edition) authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager
secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the
secret.

## Prerequisites for using SharePoint App-Only authentication

**If you're using SharePoint App-Only authentication, make**
**sure you've completed the following steps in**
**SharePoint Server (Subscription Edition):**

- Copied the SharePoint client ID generated when you registered App Only at
Site Level. ClientID format is ClientID@TenantId. For example,
`ffa956f3-8f89-44e7-b0e4-49670756342c@888d0b57-69f1-4fb8-957f-e1f0bedf82fe`.

- Copied the SharePoint client secret generated when you registered App Only
at Site Level.

###### Important

**Note:** Because client IDs and client
secrets are generated for single sites only when you register SharePoint
Server for App Only authentication, only one site URL is supported for
SharePoint App Only authentication.

- Noted the Tenant ID of your SharePoint Server (Subscription Edition) account.

- Noted your **LDAP Server Endpoint**, **LDAP**
**Search Base**, **LDAP username**, and
**LDAP password**.

###### Note

SharePoint App-Only Authentication is _not_ supported for
SharePoint 2013 version.

**(Optional) If you're using Email ID with Domain**
**from IDP to control access to your documents, make sure you've**
**completed the following steps:**

- Copied your LDAP Server Endpoint (endpoint of LDAP server including
protocol and port number). For example:
`ldap://example.com:389`.
