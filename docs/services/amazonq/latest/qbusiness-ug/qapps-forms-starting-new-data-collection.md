# Starting a new data collection

You can start a new data collection with the web experience or with the Q Apps
APIs.

To start a new data collection, you open an app with a data collection form,
configure data collection settings, and then copy and share the link to start
collecting responses.

01. Go to your Amazon Q Business web experience URL.

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Apps**.

03. Locate and open an existing Q App that has a data collection
     form.

04. Choose **Start data collection** at the top
     right.

05. Enter a name for the data collection. For example, John Doe's
     All-Hands Meeting. You use this name when you reference the data from
     the form in other cards. For example, outputting an AI-generated summary
     of responses to an output card in the app.

06. In **Advanced settings**, configure the participant
     experience with the **Allow users to submit data** and
     **Allow users to see all collected data** check
     boxes.

07. Choose **Create**.

08. Choose the options to enable/disable form submissions and whether
     users can see others' data.

09. Choose the **Copy** icon to obtain the shareable
     link.

10. Choose **Save**.

11. Share the link directly with your users. As users respond to
     questions, you can do the following from your app:

- To see user data, on the form collection card, choose
**All data**.

- To delete collected data, choose **Data collection**
**settings** and choose **Delete collected**
**data**.

- To stop or restart collecting data, toggle the **Allow**
**users to submit data** check box.

Owners can start and manage data collections with the following APIs:

- `StartQAppSession` \- Start a new data collection.

- `UpdateQAppSessionMetadata` \- Update metadata for the data
collection. For example, give the collection a name.

- `UpdateQAppSession` \- Optionally provide answers to your
own data collection questions.

- `ListQppSessionData` \- List all submitted values for form
cards.

- `ExportQAppSessionData` \- Export data in CSV format

- `StopQAppSession` \- Terminate the session

For participants, use the following APIs:

- `StartQAppSession` \- Associate the user with the data
collection.

- `GetQAppSession` \- Get the latest state of the data
collection. Use this API before and after submitting data into form
cards.

- `ListQAppSessionData` \- Get all submitted values for form
cards.

- `UpdateQappSession` \- Submit data into form cards.
