# Managing subscriptions for applications using IAM Federation

To manage user subscriptions added to an application environment, you can perform the
following actions:

###### Actions

- [Updating subscription tiers](#update-user-subscriptions-tier-iam)

- [Unsubscribing a user](#delete-user-subscriptions-iam)

- [Listing user subscriptions](#list-user-subscriptions-iam)

## Updating subscription tiers

You can update a subscription tier using the AWS Management Console or the [UpdateSubscription](../api-reference/api-updatesubscription.md) API
operation.

Amazon Q Business automatically assigns subscriptions to users in an
IAM-federated application. You can update the auto-subscription tier for your
application. When you update the auto-subscription tier for the Amazon Q Business application, the new tier applies to new users logging into
your web experience. Existing subscription types assigned to users don't get
updated when you update your subscription tier.

You can also update the subscription tier for specific users already assigned
subscriptions.

For more information on user subscriptions for an IAM federated Amazon Q Business application, see [Subscriptions for applications using IAM\
Federation](tiers.md#managing-sub-tiers-iam).

AWS CLI

**To update user or group**
**subscriptions**

```nohighlight

aws qbusiness update-subscription \
--application-id application-id \
--subscription-id subscription-id \
--type subscription-type
```

## Unsubscribing a user

When you remove a user, it cancels their subscription. The user continues to
be visible in the list of users till the end of the month, after which they're
removed from the list. An unsubscribed user can continue to use the application
until the end of the month on their canceled subscription.

You can choose to re-activate and re-assign a subscription to an inactive user
from the subscriptions list. When an unsubscribed user re-logs into a Amazon Q Business application, Amazon Q Business automatically
re-assigns them a subscription based on the active subscription tier for your
application. However, an unsubscribed user can continue to use the application
until the end of the month of their canceled subscription. So, if they start
re-using Amazon Q Business in the same month their subscription is
canceled, they will keep the same subscription tier they were originally
assigned during that month. You must cancel a subscription for a user removed
from your identity provider to stop subscription charges for them.

If an unsubscribed user wants to maintain the subscription beyond the first
month, and they start using Amazon Q Business again next month, then they
will get assigned the default subscription tier of their application (which
could be a different subscription tier than the one they were assigned
originally).
