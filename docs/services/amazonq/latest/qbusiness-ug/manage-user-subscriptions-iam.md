# Managing subscriptions for applications using IAM Federation
<a name="manage-user-subscriptions-iam"></a>

To manage user subscriptions added to an application environment, you can perform the following actions:

**Topics**
+ [Updating subscription tiers](#update-user-subscriptions-tier-iam)
+ [Unsubscribing a user](#delete-user-subscriptions-iam)
+ [Listing user subscriptions](#list-user-subscriptions-iam)

## Updating subscription tiers
<a name="update-user-subscriptions-tier-iam"></a>

You can update a subscription tier using the AWS Management Console or the [UpdateSubscription](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_UpdateSubscription.html) API operation.

Amazon Q Business automatically assigns subscriptions to users in an IAM-federated application. You can update the auto-subscription tier for your application. When you update the auto-subscription tier for the Amazon Q Business application, the new tier applies to new users logging into your web experience. Existing subscription types assigned to users don't get updated when you update your subscription tier.

You can also update the subscription tier for specific users already assigned subscriptions.

For more information on user subscriptions for an IAM federated Amazon Q Business application, see [Subscriptions for applications using IAM Federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/tiers.html#managing-sub-tiers-iam).

```

## Unsubscribing a user
<a name="delete-user-subscriptions-iam"></a>

When you remove a user, it cancels their subscription. The user continues to be visible in the list of users till the end of the month, after which they're removed from the list. An unsubscribed user can continue to use the application until the end of the month on their canceled subscription.

You can choose to re-activate and re-assign a subscription to an inactive user from the subscriptions list. When an unsubscribed user re-logs into a Amazon Q Business application, Amazon Q Business automatically re-assigns them a subscription based on the active subscription tier for your application. However, an unsubscribed user can continue to use the application until the end of the month of their canceled subscription. So, if they start re-using Amazon Q Business in the same month their subscription is canceled, they will keep the same subscription tier they were originally assigned during that month. You must cancel a subscription for a user removed from your identity provider to stop subscription charges for them.

If an unsubscribed user wants to maintain the subscription beyond the first month, and they start using Amazon Q Business again next month, then they will get assigned the default subscription tier of their application (which could be a different subscription tier than the one they were assigned originally).
