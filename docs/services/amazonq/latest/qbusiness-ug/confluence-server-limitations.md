# Known limitations for the Amazon Q Business Confluence (Server/Data Center) connector

The Amazon Q Confluence (Server/Data Center) connector has the following known
limitation:

- Because Amazon Q Business uses email addresses as unique identifiers, each user
must have a unique email address.

- The Confluence (Server/Data Center) connector may not accurately differentiate
between Confluence users with duplicate email addresses when mapping access
control lists (ACLs). This can lead to inconsistent search results, in which a
user might be able to see restricted content intended for one Confluence user
with a shared email, but not other restricted content intended for a different
Confluence user with the same email.
