# Known limitations for the Amazon Q Business Confluence (Server/Data Center) connector
<a name="confluence-server-limitations"></a>

The Amazon Q Confluence (Server/Data Center) connector has the following known limitation:
+ Because Amazon Q Business uses email addresses as unique identifiers, each user must have a unique email address.
+ The Confluence (Server/Data Center) connector may not accurately differentiate between Confluence users with duplicate email addresses when mapping access control lists (ACLs). This can lead to inconsistent search results, in which a user might be able to see restricted content intended for one Confluence user with a shared email, but not other restricted content intended for a different Confluence user with the same email.
