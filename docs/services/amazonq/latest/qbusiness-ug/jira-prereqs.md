# Prerequisites for connecting Amazon Q Business to Jira

Before you begin, make sure that you have completed the following
prerequisites.

**In Jira, make sure you have:**

- Created Jira API token authentication credentials that include a
Jira ID (email ID with domain) and a Jira credential (Jira API token). See the
[Atlassian documentation for information about managing API\
tokens](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account).

- Noted the Jira account URL from your Jira account
settings. For example,
`https://company.atlassian.net/`.

- Noted your Jira project key ID from your Jira
project settings if you want to crawl only specific Jira
projects.

- If you want to have Amazon Q automatically rotate your secret,
ensure that your IAM role includes the
`secretsmanager:PutSecretValue` and
`secretsmanager:UpdateSecret` permissions.

If you have company-managed Jira projects, you need to perform the
following:

- **Administer Jira Permissions**:
The service account - the user configuring the Amazon Q Business
integration - must have **Administer Jira** permissions. These
permissions are required to read and interpret the permission schemes of
company-managed projects to build appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs). To
assign this permission, go to the Settings icon in Jira, then
navigate to **System > Global Permissions**. Add the
_Administer Jira_ permission to the service
account.

- **Email Visibility Settings**: Jira
must provide access to the email address of the users for Amazon Q Business to correctly validate document-level permissions. To enable this, update
profile settings by navigating to **Profile Picture → Manage Account >**
**Privacy**, and setting **Email Visibility** to
Anyone. This is a requirement due to limitations in Jira's API
that impact integrations with external tools such as Amazon Q Business.

- **User and Project-Level Permissions**: The admin
user associated with the integration must have at least **Browse**
**Projects** permission in Jira. This can be granted
directly or indirectly through a group, project role, or any other applicable
configuration. To verify permissions, navigate to the specific
Jira project, go to **Project Settings >**
**Permissions**, and confirm that the admin user **Browse**
**Projects** permission. To validate permissions, use the
**Permission Helper**. Enter the user alias and select
**Browse Projects** permission to check access.

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**

- Created a Amazon Q Business application.

- Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](select-retriever.md).

- Created an [IAM role](iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.

- Stored your Jira authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager
secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the
secret.

###### Note

If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager
secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the
console.

For a list of things to consider while configuring your data source, see [Data source connector configuration best practices](connector-best-practices.md).
