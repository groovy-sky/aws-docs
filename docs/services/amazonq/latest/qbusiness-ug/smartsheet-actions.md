# Configuring a Smartsheet plugin for Amazon Q Business

Smartsheet is an enterprise work management platform that lets users manage
projects, programs and processes at scale using sheets, channels, and workspaces. If you’re
a Smartsheet user, you can create an Amazon Q Business plugin to allow your
end users to search and read sheets, and list and get reports from within their web
experience chat.

To create a Smartsheet plugin, you need configuration information from your
Smartsheet instance to set up a connection between Amazon Q and
Smartsheet and allow Amazon Q to perform actions in Smartsheet.

For more information on how to use plugins during your web experience chat, see [Using\
plugins](using-plugins.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you configure your Amazon Q Smartsheet plugin, you must do
the following:

- As an admin, create a new OAuth 2.0 Smartsheet app in the
Smartsheet developer console with scoped permissions for performing
actions in Amazon Q. To learn how to do this, see the "Register Your
App Using Developer Tools" section in [OAuth Walkthrough](https://developers.smartsheet.com/api/smartsheet/guides/advanced-topics/oauth) in the Smartsheet Developer
Documentation.

- Make sure you've added following required scopes:

- `readsheet`

- `writesheet`

- Note the domain URL of your Smartsheet instance. For example:
`https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0`.

- Note your:

- **Access token URL** – For
Smartsheet OAuth applications, this is
`https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token`.

- **Authorization URL** – For
Smartsheet OAuth applications, this is
`https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize`.

- **Redirect URL** – The URL to
which user needs to be redirected after authentication. If your deployed
web url is `<q-endpoint>`, use
`<q-endpoint>/oauth/callback` . Amazon Q Business will handle OAuth tokens in this URL. This callback
URL needs to be allowlisted in your third-party application.

- **Client ID** – The client ID
generated when you create your OAuth 2.0 application in
Smartsheet.

- **Client secret** – The client
secret generated when you create your OAuth 2.0 application in
Smartsheet.

You will need this authentication information during the plugin configuration
process.

## Service access roles

To successfully connect Amazon Q to Smartsheet, you need to give Amazon Q
the following permission to access your Secrets Manager secret to get your Smartsheet
credentials. Amazon Q assumes this role to access
your Smartsheet credentials.

The following is the service access IAM role required:

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:secretsmanager:{{your-region}}:{{your-account-id}}:secret:[[secret-id]]"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

To allow Amazon Q to assume a role, use the following trust policy:

```json

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "QBusinessApplicationTrustPolicy",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "qbusiness.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:SourceAccount": "{{source_account}}"
        },
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:SourceArn":"arn:aws:qbusiness:{{your-region}}:{{source_account}}:application/{{application_id}}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

If you use the console and choose to create a new IAM role,
Amazon Q creates the role for you. If you use the console and choose
to use an existing secret, or you use the API, make sure your IAM role contains these
permissions.

## Creating a plugin

To create a Smartsheet plugin for your web experience chat, you can use the
AWS Management Console or the [CreatePlugin](../api-reference/api-createplugin.md) API operation. The
following tabs provide a procedure for creating a Smartsheet plugin using the
console and code examples for the AWS CLI.

Console

**To create a Smartsheet plugin**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q
    console.

2. From the Amazon Q console, in
    **Applications**, select the name of your
    application from the list of applications.

3. From the left navigation menu, choose
    **Actions**, and then choose
    **Plugins**.

4. For **Plugins**, choose **Add**
**plugin**.

5. For **Add plugins**, choose
    **Smartsheet**.

6. For **Smartsheet**, enter the following
    information:
1. In **Plugin name**, for
       **Name** – A name for your
       Amazon Q plugin. The name can include hyphens
       (-), but not spaces, and can have a maximum of 1,000
       alphanumeric characters.

2. In **Domain URL**, for
       **URL** – Enter your
       Smartsheet domain URL. For example,
       `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0`.

3. **OAuth 2.0 authentication** – do
       the following:
      1. For **AWS Secrets Manager secret** –
          Choose **Create and add a new**
         **secret** or **Use an existing**
         **one**. Your secret must contain the
          following information:

- **Secret name** – A
name for your Secrets Manager secret.

- **Client ID**
– The client ID generated when you create
your OAuth 2.0 application in
Smartsheet.

- **Client**
**secret** – The client secret
generated when you create your OAuth 2.0
application in Smartsheet.

- For **Redirect**
**URL** – The URL to which user
needs to be redirected after authentication. If
your deployed web url is
`<q-endpoint>`, use
`<q-endpoint>/oauth/callback` .
Amazon Q Business will handle OAuth tokens

allowlisted in your third-party
application.

      2. For **Access token**
         **URL** – For Smartsheet
          OAuth applications, this is
          `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token`.

      3. For **Authorization**
