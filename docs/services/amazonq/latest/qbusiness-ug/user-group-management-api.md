# Managing users and groups for an Amazon Q Business application using APIs

Amazon Q Business provides APIs to manage users and groups in your Amazon Q Business. You can't configure user management using the
console—Amazon Q Business automatically invokes these API operations
for you when you configure your data source connector connection. You can use these APIs
to implement your own user and group management solution if you create a Amazon Q Business application environment programmatically.

###### Note

As of Dec 17, 2024, Amazon Q Business will recognize all email addresses as
case-insensitive and recognize subaddresses as equivalent to the original email
address. For example, JohnDoe@example.com, johndoe@example.com, and
johndoe+work@example.com will be considered the same email address. For assistance
with applications or to report a concern, contact Support, sign into the
