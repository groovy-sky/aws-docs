# Configuring a ServiceNow plugin for Amazon Q Business

ServiceNow provides a cloud-based service management system to create and manage
organization-level workflows, such as IT services, ticketing systems, and support.
ServiceNow uses incidents (tickets) to track issues. If you’re a ServiceNow
user, you can create an Amazon Q Business plugin to allow your end users to create
ServiceNow cases from within their web experience chat.

To create a ServiceNow plugin, you need configuration information from your
ServiceNow instance to set up a connection between Amazon Q and
ServiceNow and allow Amazon Q to perform actions in ServiceNow.

For more information on how to use plugins during your web experience chat, see [Using\
plugins](using-plugins.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you configure your Amazon Q ServiceNow plugin, you must do
the following:

- As an admin, set up a new user in your ServiceNow instance with scoped
permissions for performing actions in Amazon Q.

- Note your ServiceNow username and ServiceNow password. You
will need this basic authentication information for creating an AWS Secrets Manager secret during the plugin configuration process.

- Note the base URL of your ServiceNow instance. For example:
`https://yourinstance.service-now.com`.

## Service access roles

To successfully connect Amazon Q to ServiceNow, you need to give Amazon Q
the following permission to access your Secrets Manager secret to get your ServiceNow
credentials. Amazon Q assumes this role to access
your ServiceNow credentials.

The following is the service access IAM role required:

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:secretsmanager:{{your-region}}:{{your-account-id}}:secret:[[secret-id]]"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

To allow Amazon Q to assume a role, use the following trust policy:

```json

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "QBusinessApplicationTrustPolicy",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "qbusiness.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:SourceAccount": "{{source_account}}"
        },
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:SourceArn":"arn:aws:qbusiness:{{your-region}}:{{source_account}}:application/{{application_id}}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

If you use the console and choose to create a new IAM role,
Amazon Q creates the role for you. If you use the console and choose
to use an existing secret, or you use the API, make sure your IAM role contains these
permissions.

## Creating a plugin

To create a ServiceNow plugin for your web experience chat, you can use the
AWS Management Console or the [CreatePlugin](../api-reference/api-createplugin.md) API operation. The
following tabs provide a procedure for creating a ServiceNow plugin using the
console and code examples for the AWS CLI.
