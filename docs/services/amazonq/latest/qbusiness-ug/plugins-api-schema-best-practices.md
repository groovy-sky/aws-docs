# Best practices for OpenAPI schema definition for custom plugins

While application programming interfaces (APIs) have traditionally been used by
developers to integrate with external applications, today APIs are increasingly being
used by generative AI-powered assistants, such as Amazon Q Business custom
plugins. However, its important to note that APIs being used with AI assistants may
require design optimizations that were not critical for traditional application
integrations. Following the best practices below will help Amazon Q Business to
maximize the accuracy and improve efficiency when resolving end user requests.

## Optimizing OpenAPI schema accuracy

To create a custom plugin, you need to create or edit an OpenAPI schema outlining
the different API actions you want to enable for your custom plugin. Once the custom
plugin is deployed, Amazon Q Business will process an end user prompt and use
the OpenAPI schema to dynamically determine the appropriate APIs to call to
accomplish the user’s goal. Therefore, the OpenAPI schema definition has a big
impact on API selection accuracy.

The following are the OpenAPI schema sections you need to optimize to maximize the
accuracy of your Amazon Q Business plugins:

- **Names** – Names for operation IDs,
parameters, object schema property keys, title in info section, and
more.

- **Descriptions** – Descriptions for
operations, parameters, schemas, and more.

- **JSON schemas** – JSON schemas for API
inputs (schemas defined in parameters and request body). Within these
schemas, important information includes the data type of each schema and
format information (for example, date/date-time for ISO-8601 date strings),
as well as names and descriptions mentioned above.

In the next sections, we outline how you can maximize the accuracy of your custom
plugin by following best practices for your OpenAPI schema parameters.

## Best practices for OpenAPI Schema names

- Names and IDs should be human-readable, descriptive, and unambiguous while
being as concise as possible.

- Operation IDs provide important signals for understanding the function of
each operation. Though not required, it is recommended to add
`operationIds` to your API schema. The following outlines
some Operation ID naming best practices:

- Avoid noun-only `operationIds`, like
`contacts`. Instead, prefix operation names with
descriptive verbs like `get`, `find`,
`search`, `create`, `update`,
and `delete`. For example,
`getContacts`.

- Ensure `operationIds` meaningfully relate to the
function of the operation. Avoid including `operationIds`
with meaningless suffixes/prefixes, like `search_1` and
`search_2`. If multiple operations perform similar
functions, but differ only by inputs, consider creating IDs like
`searchByName` or `searchByEmail`, or even
merging these operations.

- Avoid adding long, redundant prefixes to names. For example, avoid
`contactsPlugin.getContacts` and
`contactsPlugin.createContact`. Instead, use
`getContacts` and `createContact`.

- Names of input request body properties and parameters are important for
determining the role and purpose of each input needed for invoking an
operation. The following outlines some input request naming best
practices:

- Avoid non-descriptive parameter names like `id`.
Instead include a descriptive noun, like
`contactId`.

- It’s not necessary to include information that is redundant with
the JSON data type of the input. For example, avoid using
`recipientEmailsArray` and instead just use
`recipientEmails`.

- Be consistent with parameter names. Generally, parameters and response
properties with the same name should mean the same thing across all
operations in your schema. The following outlines some parameter naming best
practices:

- Avoid using different names for parameters with the same meaning.
For example, `start_date` in one API and
`begin_date` in another API if they mean the same
thing.

- Ensure parameter names and property names in responses are
consistent with each other. For example, if an API returns
`begin_date`, then also use the name
`begin_date` in the input parameters if they have the
same meaning.

## Best practices for OpenAPI Schema descriptions

- Descriptions should be self-contained, providing sufficient guidance for
how and when to use the operation or parameter they describe. The following
outlines some description creation best practices:

- Operation descriptions should describe what the operation does,
including when, when not, and how to use it.

- Avoid verbose descriptions. Parameter descriptions should
concisely describe their purpose and how they impact the behavior of
the operation. For example, rather than write “this field accepts an
ISO-8601 date, which is of the format YYYY-MM-DD”, assign date to
the format field.

- Concise explanations are generally more useful than
examples.

- Make dependencies between operations explicit in the description.
If an operation always requires another operation to be called first
(such as, populating an input parameter from the other operation’s
outputs), make this clear in the description of the operation or
parameter.

- Use descriptions only where there is ambiguity or missing context. Avoid
adding descriptions that provide no additional information. Restrict the
description to information needed to use the API for the use cases Amazon Q Business custom plugin is intended to handle.

- Descriptions should not reference external links/URLs. Amazon Q Business custom plugins may not be able to access these.

- Avoid referencing operations by their _path_ or
_verb_. Instead use their operation ID when referring
to other operations in descriptions.

- Avoid referencing schema components or API paths (except dependency
`operationIds`) in the description. Ensure that descriptions
are self-contained. As an exception to this, descriptions may reference
dependency operations by their `operationIds` but should avoid
providing specific usage examples of the operation. The following outlines
some referencing best practices:

- Don’t refer to operations by their API paths (e.g.
`/api/v1/timeoff/requests`). Instead, use
`operationIds` to refer to operations in
descriptions. For example, `GetTimeOffRequests`.

- Don’t refer to schema components like
`#/components/schemas/TimeOffRequest`.

- If examples are necessary, describe them in abstract terms. “For
example, use `{operationId}` to do `{X}`” or
“Use `{operationId}` when the end user asks
for...”.

- Internally, Amazon Q Business may use generate API calls
differently than described in the OpenAPI schema. So, including
usage examples may not always be helpful.

## Best practices for JSON input schemas

- Simpler interfaces will lead to more efficient, consistent, and accurate
plugin usage from Amazon Q Business. Thus, having fewer input
parameters of lower complexity is best.

- Keep the total number of parameter schemas per operation low. Keeping the
total number of parameter schemas to 10 at most, but less than 4 on average,
will give the best results. Having more parameters may result in slower
responses because Amazon Q Business custom plugins will need to fill
out each field.

- Avoid including unnecessary optional input parameters. For example, for
search APIs with many parameters for filtering results, use the most
informative/important filters. Or, split into multiple operations to search
by alternate criteria.

- Avoid structurally complex/nested inputs when possible. The following
outlines some input parameter structure best practices:

- **Instead of** `{"start": {"type": "object", "properties": {"date": {...},
                                      "time": {...}}, "end": {...}}` **input** `{"start_date": {...}, "start_time": {...}, ..., "end_time":
                                      {...}}`.

- Avoid schemas containing array types, which are not supported. For
example, schemas such as `{"type": "array", "items":
                                      {"string"}}` are not supported..

- Avoid circular references ( `$ref` inside of
`$ref`). Circular references can occur in nested
structures when the same reference ( `$ref`) appears
inside of its de-referenced value. Although these are valid OpenAPI
specifications, Amazon Q Business custom plugin may not
reliably resolve these recursive definitions.

- Avoid composition keywords ( `allOf`, `not`,
`oneOf`, or `anyOf` ), which are not
supported

- Use standard values in the format field for string parameters. For
example, `date-time` or `date` for capturing ISO-8601
dates/times.

## Other important considerations for OpenAPI specifications

- Never expose sensitive information in the API schema or API outputs. If
information should not be exposed to the end user, do not include it in your
API specification or use an API that produces such outputs.

- If it is undesirable for an Amazon Q Business custom plugin to
reference certain information in the API schemas to the end user, you can
use instructions in the operation descriptions to help discourage this.
However, you should not rely on this mechanism for highly sensitive
information.

- Only include essential information in API responses. Redundant or
excessively verbose information will reduce the efficiency of an Amazon Q Business custom plugin.

- Limit paginated search results explicitly, particularly if each result
returned is large/complex. Large API responses may result in slower
responses for end users. Consider setting guidance or limits in the
description of the parameter (for example, set to five at most).

- Only 2XX responses may be shared with Amazon Q Business custom
plugin end users. 4xx and 5xx responses will not be shared with end users.
If you want to expose specific errors from the API, consider using a 2XX
code for such errors. Ensure you include information that is appropriate to
share with the end user.

- The OpenAPI specification should be self-contained. Ensure that the set of
API operations described in the schema support complete use cases without
relying on APIs not defined or other plugins.

## Example of API Schema optimization

This section shows you an example of an API schema before and after our best
practices are applied. The example API is used for managing Paid Time Off (PTO)
requests for employees and supports two operations: checking the status of requests
(with `api.V1.TimeOffRequest`) and making new requests (with
`api.V1.RequestTimeOff`).

The following is the example unoptimized API Schema:

```json

    TimeOffRequests:
      type: array
      items:
        $ref: "#/components/schemas/TimeOffRequest"
```

Applying the best practices defined above, there are multiple updates that should
be made to this API schema to get the best results when using Amazon Q Business custom plugins.

First, based on guidance to make names concise, descriptive and unambiguous, we’ll
make a few updates to the operation IDs, parameter names, and schema title:

- Change `example.api.V1.RequestTimeOff` to
`CreateTimeOffRequest`

- Change `example.api.V1.RequestTimeOff` to
`GetTimeOffRequests`

- Change the schema title in the info section from `API for PTO Request
                              Management` to `TimeOff`

If you are able to change the API itself, we’d also like you to fix parameter
names. Change parameters named `type` and `status` to
`request_type` and `request_status` respectively

Next, based on best practices for descriptions, we’ll make the following
updates:

- Modify the description of `/api/v1/timeoff/requests` and
`/api/v1/timeoff/request` to make them self-contained (remove
URL) and describe what they do and how to use them. For example:

- Change `Existing requests for the authenticated user. See the
                                      docs <a href=https://example.com>here</a> for more
                                      details.` to `Return existing time off requests
                                      (including information like the current approval status,
                                      dates/days used) for the authenticated user.`

- Change `Make a request for the authenticated user. See <a
                                      href=https://example.com/>API docs</a> for more
                                      details.` to `Create a new time off request of a
                                      particular type (e.g. Personal or Vacation) for the
                                      authenticated user based on a start and end date
                                      (inclusive)`.

- Add descriptions for ambiguous parameters. For example:

- For the end date of a request, add a description: `Last day
                                      for the request (inclusive) in ISO-8601 format (for example,
                                      YYYY-MM-DD)`.

- For the start date, add a description: `First day of the
                                      request in ISO-8601 format (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD)`.

- Based on guidance to limit paginated search results explicitly, we’ll add
a description to the `limit` field in
`GetTimeOffRequests`. For example, `Limit on the number
                              of requests to return. Limit to 5 unless otherwise
                          instructed`.

Finally, we’ll apply changes based on the API input schema best practices:

- Assuming we have control over the API implementation, we’d like to apply
guidance on avoiding unnecessary nesting. For this, we can convert
`range` (which contains start and end dates) to two top-level
properties called `startDate` and `endDate`.

- Following guidance to use standard format fields, we’ll add format:
`date` to start/end date fields (assuming we are expecting
standard date formats).

After making corrections, we end up with a vastly improved API specification that
will maximize the Amazon Q Business custom plugin accuracy and efficiency in
resolving user requests.

The following is the API Schema after we've added optimization fixes:
