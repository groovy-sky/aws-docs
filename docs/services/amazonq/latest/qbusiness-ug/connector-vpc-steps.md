# Configuring Amazon VPC support for Amazon Q Business connectors

To configure Amazon VPC for use with your Amazon Q Business
connectors, take the following steps.

###### Steps

- [Step 1. Create Amazon VPC subnets for Amazon Q Business](#connector-vpc-prerequisites-1)

- [Step 2. Create Amazon VPC security groups for Amazon Q Business](#connector-vpc-prerequisites-2)

- [Step 3. Configure your external data source and Amazon VPC](#connector-vpc-prerequisites-3)

## Step 1. Create Amazon VPC subnets for Amazon Q Business

Create or choose an existing Amazon VPC subnet that Amazon Q Business can use to access your data source. The prepared subnets
must be in one of the following AWS Regions and Availability Zones:

- US West (Oregon)/us-west-2—usw2-az1, usw2-az2,
usw2-az3

- US East (N. Virginia)/us-east-1—use1-az1, use1-az2,
use1-az4

- Europe (Ireland)/eu-west-1—euw1-az1, euw1-az2,
euw1-az3

- Asia Pacific (Sydney)/ap-southeast-2—apse2-az1, apse2-az2,
apse2-az3

Your data source must be accessible from the subnets that you provided to
Amazon Q Business connector.

For more information about how to configure Amazon VPC subnets,
see [Subnets for your Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.

If Amazon Q Business must route the connection between two or more
subnets, you can prepare multiple subnets. For example, the subnet that
contains your data source is out of IP addresses. In that case, you can
provide Amazon Q with an additional subnet that has sufficient IP
addresses and connected to the first subnet. If you list multiple subnets,
the subnets must be able to communicate with each other.

## Step 2. Create Amazon VPC security groups for Amazon Q Business

To connect your Amazon Q Business data source connector to Amazon VPC, you must prepare one or more security groups from your VPC
to assign to Amazon Q Business. The security groups will be associated
to the elastic network interface created by Amazon Q Business. This
network interface controls inbound and outbound traffic to and from Amazon Q Business when accessing the Amazon VPC subnets.

Make sure that your security group's outbound rules allow the traffic from
Amazon Q Business data source connectors to access the subnets and
the data source that you are going to sync with. For example, you might use
an MySQL connector to sync from a MySQL
database. If you're using the default port, the security groups must allow
Amazon Q to access port 3306 on the host that runs the
database.

We recommend that you configure a default security group with the
following values for Amazon Q Business to use:

- **Inbound rules** – If you
choose to leave this empty, all inbound traffic will be
blocked.

- **Outbound rules** – Add one
rule to allow all outbound traffic so that Amazon Q Business
can initiate the requests to sync from your data source.

- **IP version** –
IPv4

- **Type** – All
traffic

- **Protocol** – All
traffic

- **Port range** –
All

- **Destination** –
0.0.0.0/0

For more information about how to configure Amazon VPC security
groups, see [Security group rules](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/security-group-rules.md) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

## Step 3. Configure your external data source and Amazon VPC

Make sure that your external data source has the correct permissions
configuration and network settings for Amazon Q Business to access it.
You can find detailed instructions on how to configure your data sources in
the prerequisites section of each connector page.

Also, check your Amazon VPC settings and make sure that your
external data source is reachable from the subnet you will assign to Amazon Q Business. To do this, we recommend that you create an Amazon EC2 instance in the same subnet with the same security groups and
test access to your data source from this Amazon EC2 instance. For
