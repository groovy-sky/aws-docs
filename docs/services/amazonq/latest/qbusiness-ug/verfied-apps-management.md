# Understanding and managing Verified Amazon Q Apps

The Verified Q Apps feature empowers administrators to endorse published Amazon Q Apps.
The goal is to enhance governance and provide a clear signal to end-users about which
Q Apps are recommended for use within their organization. By labeling apps as
_Verified_, admins can help improve trust and adoption of the
most valuable, high-quality Q Apps created by employees.

Admins can easily endorse published Q Apps by updating their status from
_Default_ to _Verified_ directly within the
Amazon Q Business console. The idea is that admins would work closely with their business
stakeholders to determine the criteria for verifying apps, based on their organization's
specific needs and policies. This admin-led labeling capability is a reactive approach
to endorsing published apps, without gating the publishing process for app
creators.

When users access the Amazon Q Apps Library, they will see a distinct blue checkmark
icon on any apps that have been marked as _Verified_ by
administrators. Additionally verified apps are automatically surfaced to the top of the
app list within each category, making them easily discoverable. Users can also filter
the library to view only Verified apps.

###### Note

If a Amazon Q App is unpublished and then re-published, or if changes are made to a
_Verified_ app, the verified label will be removed until the
administrator re-applies it.

## Considerations for verifying Amazon Q Apps

To start using the Verified Apps feature in Amazon Q Apps, consider the following:

- **Determine Verification Criteria:** Work
with business stakeholders to establish the criteria for verifying Q Apps.
This could include factors like content quality, alignment with
organizational policies, and user feedback.

- **Review Published Apps:** Review the list of
published apps against your criteria. This can be accessed from the
Amazon Q Business console or API.

## Verifying Amazon Q Apps

To update an app state to verified you can use the console; or the [UpdateLibraryItem](../api-reference/api-qapps-updatelibraryitem.md) API operation. The
following tabs provide a procedure for the console and code examples for the
AWS CLI.

Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business
    console.

2. In **Applications**, select the name of your
    application environment from the list of applications.

3. From the left navigation menu, choose
    **Enhancements**, and then choose
    **Amazon Q Apps**.

4. In the **Amazon Q Apps in library** section,
    choose the Q Apps that you want to verify, and then choose
