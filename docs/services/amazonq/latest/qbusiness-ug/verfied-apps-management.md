# Understanding and managing Verified Amazon Q Apps
<a name="verfied-apps-management"></a>

The Verified Q Apps feature empowers administrators to endorse published Amazon Q Apps. The goal is to enhance governance and provide a clear signal to end-users about which Q Apps are recommended for use within their organization. By labeling apps as *Verified*, admins can help improve trust and adoption of the most valuable, high-quality Q Apps created by employees.

Admins can easily endorse published Q Apps by updating their status from *Default* to *Verified* directly within the Amazon Q Business console. The idea is that admins would work closely with their business stakeholders to determine the criteria for verifying apps, based on their organization's specific needs and policies. This admin-led labeling capability is a reactive approach to endorsing published apps, without gating the publishing process for app creators.

When users access the Amazon Q Apps Library, they will see a distinct blue checkmark icon on any apps that have been marked as *Verified* by administrators. Additionally verified apps are automatically surfaced to the top of the app list within each category, making them easily discoverable. Users can also filter the library to view only Verified apps.

**Note**
If a Amazon Q App is unpublished and then re-published, or if changes are made to a *Verified* app, the verified label will be removed until the administrator re-applies it.

To start using the Verified Apps feature in Amazon Q Apps, consider the following:
+ **Determine Verification Criteria:** Work with business stakeholders to establish the criteria for verifying Q Apps. This could include factors like content quality, alignment with organizational policies, and user feedback.
