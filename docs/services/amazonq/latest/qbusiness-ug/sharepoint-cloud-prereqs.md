## Prerequisites for using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) App-Only authentication
<a name="sharepoint-cloud-prereqs-azure-app-only"></a>

**If you're using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) App-Only authentication, make sure you've completed the following steps in SharePoint (Online):**
+ Copied your SharePoint (Online) instance URLs. The format for the host URL you enter is {{https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite}} or {{https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com}}. Your URL must start with `https` and contain `sharepoint.com`.
+ Copied the domain name of your SharePoint (Online) instance URL.
+ Copied the tenant ID of your Microsoft SharePoint (Online) instance. For details on how to find your tenant ID, see [Find your Microsoft 365 tenant ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/find-your-office-365-tenant-id) on the Microsoft website.
+ Generated an X.509 certificate. For more information on how to create and configure an X.509 certificate, see [Granting access via Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) App-Only](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread) and [New-PnPAzureCertificate](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/cmdlets/New-PnPAzureCertificate.html) in *Microsoft developer documentation*.
+ After generating the X.509 certificate, upload your .CRT file (the public certificate) to an Amazon S3 bucket. Note the file path to a X.509 certificate you have created and stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. (Ex. `s3://bucket-name/path/to/certificate.crt`). Ensure that your Amazon Q Business IAM role has permissions to read from this Amazon S3 bucket.
+ Noted the private key and the Client ID you generated after SharePoint (Online) Azure App registration.
+ Configured a Sharepoint (Online) Azure App using one of the two options below and noted its Client ID and Client secret.
**Note**
If you want to crawl specific sites, you can choose to restrict permissions to specific sites rather than all sites available in the domain. To do this, use the Sites.Selected (Application) permission. With this API permission, you need to set access permission on every site explicitly through the Microsoft Graph API. For more information, see [Microsoft's blog on Sites.Selected permissions](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sharepoint-blog/develop-applications-that-use-sites-selected-permissions-for-spo/ba-p/3790476).

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**
+ Created a Amazon Q Business application.
+ Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/select-retriever.html).
+ Created an [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/iam-roles.html#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.
+ Stored your SharePoint (Online) authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the secret.
**Note**
If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the console.

For a list of things to consider while configuring your data source, see [ Data source connector configuration best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/connector-best-practices.html).

*Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) App-Only Option 1: Global Read Access*

If you anticipate that you will be indexing several Sharepoint sites and would like to simplify your setup process, you can take the following steps to provide the Q Business Sharepoint connector global access. Otherwise, skip to section 2 below.

1. Create a Sharepoint client app to which we will assign the permissions needed by your Q Business connector. To register the app:

   1. Log in to the Azure Portal with your Microsoft account.

   1.

      1. Provide the name for your application. In the example we are using the name TargetApp. The Amazon Q Business application uses TargetApp to connect to the SharePoint Online site to crawl and index the data.

      1. Choose "Accounts" in the organizational directory. (Tenant name only - Single tenant).

      1. Choose "Register".

      1. Note down the application (client ID and the directory (tenant) on the Overview page, as you'll need them when prompted for "TargetApp-ClientId" and "TenantId".

      1. Navigate to "Manage > API Permissions" in the navigation pane

      1. Navigate to "Add a permission > Sharepoint > Application permissions" to allow the application to read data in your organization's directory regarding the signed-in user.

      1. Search "AllSites.Read".

      1. Choose "Add permissions".

      1. Navigate to "Add a permission > Microsoft Graph > Application permissions"

      1. Search and add the following permissions:
         + "Notes.Read.All"
         + "Sites.Read.All"
         + "Sites.FullControl.All (Application)" (required only if you intend to enable ACLs)
         + "Sites.Read.All (Application)"(required only if you intend to enable ACLs)
         + "Sites.FullControl.All" (required only if you intend to enable ACLs)
         + "GroupMember.Read.All" (required only if you intend to enable ACLs)
         + "User.Read.All" (required only if you intend to enable ACLs)

      1. Navigate to "Remove permission"

      1. Remove the original "User.Read - Delegated" permission

      1. Choose "Grant admin consent" for the default directory

      1. Save the client ID generated from this app for when you configure the Sharepoint connector in the Q Business console or API

         The following tables summarize all the permissions your application should have.
         + If you're not using ACL, your application should have the permission:
[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/sharepoint-cloud-prereqs.html)
**Note**
Read.All and Sites.Read.All are required only if you want to crawl OneNote Documents.
         + If you're using ACL, your application should have the following permissions:
[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/sharepoint-cloud-prereqs.html)

1. Create a client secret for your Sharepoint App:

   1. Within your client App navigate to "Clients and secrets > Client secrets"

   1. Click on create a new secret.

1. Generate a new Certificate to be shared between Q Business SharePoint Connector and Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) App:

   1. Use the example command below to generate your own x509 certificate.

   1. Run the following command:`openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -noenc -sha1 -keyout /tmp/private.key -out /tmp/sharepoint.crt -nodes -set_serial 1 -days 365 -subj "/CN=amazon/emailAddress=example@aws.com/C=US/ST=Texas/L=Dallas/O=amazon/OU=amazon`

   1. Save the generated private key located in /tmp/private.key for later when you configure the Q Business Sharepoint connector via the Q Business console or API.

*Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) App-Only Option 2: Read Access for only Selected Sites*

If you anticipate that you will be indexing a manageable number of Sharepoint sites and would prefer to limit the permissions of the Q Business connector to just the Sharepoint sites you intend to index, you can take the following steps:

1. Create a Sharepoint client app: Create a Sharepoint client app to which we will assign the permissions needed by your Q Business connector. To register the app:

   1. Log in to the Azure Portal with your Microsoft account.

   1. Choose "New Registration":

      1. Provide the name for your application. In the example we are using the name TargetApp. The Amazon Q Business application uses TargetApp to connect to the SharePoint Online site to crawl and index the data.

      1. Choose "Accounts" in the organizational directory. (Tenant name only - Single tenant).

      1. Choose "Register".

      1. Note down the application (client ID and the directory (tenant) on the Overview page, as you'll need them when prompted for "TargetApp-ClientId" and "TenantId".

      1. Navigate to "Manage > API Permissions" in the navigation pane

      1. Navigate to "Add a permission > Sharepoint > Application permissions" to allow the application to read data in your organization's directory regarding the signed-in user.

      1. Search "Sites.Selected".

      1. Choose "Add permissions".

      1. Navigate to "Add a permission > Microsoft Graph > Application permissions"

      1. Search and add the following permissions:
         + "Notes.Read.All"
         + "Sites.Selected"
         + "GroupMember.Read.All" (required only if you intend to enable ACLs)
         + "User.Read.All" (required only if you intend to enable ACLs)

      1. Navigate to "Remove permission"

      1. Remove the original "User.Read - Delegated" permission

      1. Choose "Grant admin consent" for the default directory

      1. Save the client ID generated from this app for when you configure the Sharepoint connector in the Q Business console or API

         The following tables summarize all the permissions your application should have.
         + If you're not using ACL, your application should have the permissions:
[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/sharepoint-cloud-prereqs.html)

[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/sharepoint-cloud-prereqs.html)

1. Create a client secret for your Sharepoint App:

   1. Within your client App navigate to "Clients and secrets > Client secrets"

   1. Click on create a new secret.

1. Generate a new Certificate to be shared between Q Business SharePoint Connector and Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) App:

   1. Run the following command: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -noenc -sha1 -keyout /tmp/private.key -out /tmp/sharepoint.crt -nodes -set_serial 1 -days 365 -subj "/CN=amazon/emailAddress=example@aws.com/C=US/ST=Texas/L=Dallas/O=amazon/OU=amazon"`

   1. Save the generated private key located in /tmp/private.key for later when you configure the Q Business Sharepoint connector via the Q Business console or API.

   1. Upload the generated certificate located in /tmp/sharepoint.crt to an S3 bucket so you can use it later when you configure the Q Business Sharepoint connector via the Q Business console or API. You will also need this certificate for the next step.

1. Update your Sharepoint Client App’s Certificate:

   1. Navigate to the Sharepoint client app you created in step 1.

   1. Navigate to “Certificates and secrets > Certificates > Upload certificate” and upload the certificate (.crt file) you generated in step 4.

1. Create a Sharepoint admin app: This app will be used to provide the necessary site read permissions for the client OAuth App you created in the previous step. You can delete this admin app after you have completed all the steps. To register the app:

   1. Log in to the Azure Portal with your Microsoft account.

   1. Choose “New Registration”:

      1. Provide the name for your application.

      1. Choose "Accounts" in the organizational directory. (Tenant name only - Single tenant).

      1. Choose "Register".

      1. Locate your app ID, app secret, and tenant ID for your admin app and save them for the next step.

      1. Navigate to "Manage > API Permissions" in the navigation pane

      1. Navigate to "Add a permission > Sharepoint > Application permissions" to allow the application to read data in your organization's directory regarding the signed-in user.

      1. Search "Sites.FullControl.All".

      1. Choose "Add permissions".

      1. Navigate to "Add a permission > Microsoft Graph > Application permissions"

      1. Search "Sites.Read.All".

      1. Choose "Add permissions".

1. Generate an access token for your Sharepoint admin app: Now use the following code snippet to generate an access token for your app, but replace adminAppID, adminAppSecret, and tenantID with the values you saved from step 2.

   1.

     ```
     adminAppId=$1
     adminAppSecret=$2
     tenantId=$3

     tokenResponse=$(curl -s --location \
     "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$tenantId/oauth2/v2.0/token" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
     --data-urlencode "grant_type=client_credentials" \
     --data-urlencode "client_id=$adminAppId" \
     --data-urlencode "client_secret=$adminAppSecret" \
     --data-urlencode "scope=offline_access https://graph.microsoft.com/.default")

     adminAppToken=$(echo $tokenResponse | jq -r '.access_token')
     echo $adminAppToken
     ```

1. Obtain a Site ID for each of your Sharepoint sites: Repeat the following steps for each of the Sharepoint sites you want your Q Business connector to crawl:

   1. Visit `https://{yourcompany}.sharepoint.com/sites/{SiteName}`in a browser. Enter the appropriate login credentials if needed. Validate that you are able to see your SharePoint site

   1. Now append /\_api/site/id at the end of {SiteName}. You should see a response something similar to below containing your site id (96a47524-4b21-446f-bf96-96d2f6fe4aa7)

      ```
      <d:Id m:type="Edm.Guid" xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices" xmlns:georss="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml" xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/metadata">96a47524-4b21-446f-bf96-96d2f6fe4aa7</d:Id>
      ```

1. Grant your Sharepoint client app permissions to your selected sites: Now that you have created your Sharepoint admin app, Sharepoint client app, and have a list of site ids, you are ready to grant your client app the necessary permissions to access these sites. Repeat the following steps for each of the site ids you obtained from step 4.

   1. Modify the code snippet below to provide the following:

      1. clientAppId: The Application (client) ID from step 1.

      1. clientAppName: The display name of your Sharepoint client app from step 1.

      1. adminToken: The access token you generated in step 6.

      1. siteId: One of the site ids you obtained from step 7.

   1. Run the following command:

      ```
      clientAppId=$1
      clientAppName=$2
      clientAppId=$1
      clientAppName=$2
      adminToken=$3
      siteToGivePermissionTo=$4

      grantPermissionResponse=$(curl -s --location "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/$siteToGivePermissionTo/permissions" \
          --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --header "Authorization: Bearer $adminToken" \
          --data '{
               "roles": ["fullcontrol"],
               "grantedToIdentities": [{
                  "application": {
                    "id": "'${clientAppId}'",
                    "displayName": "'${clientAppName}'"
                  }
                }]
              }')

      echo $grantPermissionResponse
      ```

   1. If the command was successful, you'll see a response as follows:

      ```
      {
        "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#sites('awsplatodemo.sharepoint.com%2C96a47524-4b21-446f-bf96-96d2f6fe4aa7')/permissions/$entity",

        "roles": [
          "fullcontrol"
        ],
        "grantedToIdentitiesV2": [
          {
            "application": {
              "displayName": "demo-client-app",
              "id": "c069b8e2-74aa-43e4-89cb-d6fd358fece8"
            }
          }
        ],
        "grantedToIdentities": [
          {
            "application": {

     adminAppToken=$(echo $tokenResponse | jq -r '.access_token')
     echo $adminAppToken
     ```

1. Obtain a Site ID for each of your Sharepoint sites: Repeat the following steps for each of the Sharepoint sites you want your Q Business connector to crawl:

   1. Visit https://{yourcompany}.sharepoint.com/sites/{SiteName} in a browser. Enter the appropriate login credentials if needed. Validate that you are able to see your SharePoint site

   1. Now append /\_api/site/id at the end of {SiteName}. You should see a response something similar to below containing your site id ([IP\_ADDRESS]a7)

      ```
      <d:Id m:type="Edm.Guid" xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices" xmlns:georss="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml" xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/metadata">[IP_ADDRESS]a7</d:Id>
      ```

1. Grant your Sharepoint client app permissions to your selected sites: Now that you have created your Sharepoint admin app, Sharepoint client app, and have a list of site ids, you are ready to grant your client app the necessary permissions to access these sites. Repeat the following steps for each of the site ids you obtained from step 4.

   1. Modify the code snippet below to provide the following:

      1. clientAppId: The Application (client) ID from step 1

      1. clientAppName: The display name of your Sharepoint client app from step 1

      1. adminToken: The adminAppToken you generated in step 3

      1. siteId: One of the site ids you obtained from step 4.

   1.

      ```
      clientAppId=$1
      clientAppName=$2
      adminToken=$3
      siteToGivePermissionTo=$4

      grantPermissionResponse=$(curl -s --location "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/$siteToGivePermissionTo/permissions" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $adminToken" \
      --data '{
      "roles": ["fullcontrol"],
      "grantedToIdentities": [{
      "application": {
      "id": "'${clientAppId}'",
      "displayName": "'${clientAppName}'"
      }
      }]
      }')

      echo $grantPermissionResponse
      ```

   1. If the command was successful, you'll see a response as follows:

      ```
      {
      "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#sites('awsplatodemo.sharepoint.com%2C[IP_ADDRESS]a7')/permissions/$entity",
      "id": "aTowaS50fG1zLnNwLmV4dHxjMDY5YjhlMi03NGFhLTQzZTQtODljYi1kNmZkMzU4ZmVjZThAZjIwNDQ2OTItZGMwOS00MjZlLWFlMGQtNGFlZDljMTI3ODA2",
      "roles": [
      "fullcontrol"
      ],
      "grantedToIdentitiesV2": [
      {
      "application": {
      "displayName": "demo-client-app",
      "id": "c069b8e2-74aa-43e4-89cb-d6fd358fece8"
      }
      }
      ],
      "grantedToIdentities": [
      {
      "application": {
      "displayName": "demo-client-app",
      "id": "c069b8e2-74aa-43e4-89cb-d6fd358fece8"
      }
      }
      ]
      }
      ```

## Prerequisites for using SharePoint App-Only authentication
<a name="sharepoint-cloud-prereqs-sharepoint-app-only"></a>

**If you're using SharePoint App-Only authentication, make sure you've completed the following steps in SharePoint (Online):**
+ Copied your SharePoint (Online) instance URLs. The format for the host URL you enter is {{https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite}} or {{https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com}}. Your URL must start with `https` and contain `sharepoint.com`.
+ Copied the domain name of your SharePoint (Online) instance URL.
+ Copied the tenant ID of your Microsoft SharePoint (Online) instance. For details on how to find your tenant ID, see [Find your Microsoft 365 tenant ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/find-your-office-365-tenant-id) on the Microsoft website.
+ Noted your SharePoint (Online) client ID and client secret generated while granting permission to SharePoint App-Only, and your Client ID and Client secret generated after SharePoint (Online) Azure App registration.
+ **If you're crawling OneNote documents and using **Identity crawler****, added the following permissions:
[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/sharepoint-cloud-prereqs.html)
**Note**
No API permissions are required for crawling entities using SharePoint (Online) **App-Only authentication**.

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**
+ Created a Amazon Q Business application.
+ Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/select-retriever.html).
+ Created an [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/iam-roles.html#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.
+ Stored your SharePoint (Online) authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the secret.
**Note**
If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the console.

For a list of things to consider while configuring your data source, see [ Data source connector configuration best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/connector-best-practices.html).

## Prerequisites for using basic authentication
<a name="sharepoint-cloud-prereqs-basic"></a>

**If you're using basic authentication, make sure you've completed the following steps in SharePoint (Online):**
+ Copied your SharePoint (Online) instance URLs. The format for the host URL you enter is {{https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite}} or {{https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com}}. Your URL must start with `https` and contain `sharepoint.com`.
+ Copied the domain name of your SharePoint (Online) instance URL.
+ Noted your basic authentication credentials containing the username and password that you use to connect to SharePoint (Online) Online.
+ Deactivated **Security Defaults** in your Azure portal using an administrative user. For more information on managing security default settings in the Azure portal, see [Microsoft documentation on how to enable/disable security defaults](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/101179/how-to-disable-the-two-factor-authentication-from).
+ Deactivated multi-factor authentication (MFA) in your SharePoint account, so that Amazon Q is not blocked from crawling your SharePoint content.

**Note**
No API permissions are required for crawling entities using **Basic authentication**.

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**
+ Created a Amazon Q Business application.
+ Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/select-retriever.html).
+ Created an [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/iam-roles.html#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.
