# Configuring a ServiceNow plugin for Amazon Q Business

ServiceNow provides a cloud-based service management system to create and manage
organization-level workflows, such as IT services, ticketing systems, and support.
ServiceNow uses incidents (tickets) to track issues. If you’re a ServiceNow
user, you can create an Amazon Q Business plugin to allow your end users to perform
the following actions from within their web experience chat:

- Create incident

- Read incident

- Update incident

- Delete incident

- Read change request

- Create change request

- Update change request

- Delete change request

To create a ServiceNow plugin, you need configuration information from your
ServiceNow instance to set up a connection between Amazon Q and
ServiceNow and allow Amazon Q to perform actions in ServiceNow.

For more information on how to use plugins during your web experience chat, see [Using\
plugins](using-plugins.md).

- [Service access roles](#servicenow-plugin-iam)

- [Creating a plugin](#servicenow-plugin-create)

## Prerequisites

Before you configure your Amazon Q ServiceNow plugin, you must do
the following:

- As an admin, create a new OAuth 2.0 ServiceNow app in the
ServiceNow developer console with scoped permissions for performing
actions in Amazon Q. To learn how to do this, see [Create an endpoint for clients to access the instance](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/xanadu-platform-security/page/administer/security/task/t_CreateEndpointforExternalClients.html) in
ServiceNow Developer Documentation.

- Make sure the OAuth plugin is active and the OAuth activation property is set
to true. Required scopes:

- `read`

- `write`

- `useraccount`

###### Note

We recommend choosing Classic OAuth Scopes.

- Make sure to create an authentication profile by following the steps outlined
in [ServiceNow Documentation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/xanadu-platform-security/page/integrate/authentication/task/create-authentication-profile.html). For **Type**,
select **OAuth**. For authentication policy, select
**Allow Access Policy**.

Then, add the authentication profile you created to the REST API access
policies for **Table API** and **Change**
**Management** by following steps outlined in [Create REST API access policy](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/xanadu-platform-security/page/integrate/authentication/task/create-api-access-policy.html) in ServiceNow
Documentation.

- Note the domain URL of your ServiceNow instance. For example:
`https://yourInstanceId.service-now.com`.

- Note your:

- **Access token URL** – For
ServiceNow OAuth applications, this is
`https://yourInstanceId.service-now.com/oauth_token.do`.

- **Authorization URL** – For
ServiceNow OAuth applications, this is
`https://yourInstanceId.service-now.com/oauth_auth.do`.

- **Redirect URL** – The URL to
which user needs to be redirected after authentication. If your deployed
web url is `<q-endpoint>`, use
`<q-endpoint>/oauth/callback` . Amazon Q Business will handle OAuth tokens in this URL. This callback
URL needs to be allowlisted in your third-party application.

- **Client ID** – The client ID
generated when you create your OAuth 2.0 application in
ServiceNow.

- **Client secret** – The client
secret generated when you create your OAuth 2.0 application in
ServiceNow.

You will need this authentication information during the plugin configuration
process.

## Service access roles

To successfully connect Amazon Q to ServiceNow, you need to give Amazon Q
the following permission to access your Secrets Manager secret to get your ServiceNow
credentials. Amazon Q assumes this role to access
your ServiceNow credentials.

The following is the service access IAM role required:

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:secretsmanager:{{your-region}}:{{your-account-id}}:secret:[[secret-id]]"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

To allow Amazon Q to assume a role, use the following trust policy:

```json

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "QBusinessApplicationTrustPolicy",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "qbusiness.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:SourceAccount": "{{source_account}}"
        },
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:SourceArn":"arn:aws:qbusiness:{{your-region}}:{{source_account}}:application/{{application_id}}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

If you use the console and choose to create a new IAM role,
Amazon Q creates the role for you. If you use the console and choose
to use an existing secret, or you use the API, make sure your IAM role contains these
permissions.

## Creating a plugin

To create a ServiceNow plugin for your web experience chat, you can use the
AWS Management Console or the [CreatePlugin](../api-reference/api-createplugin.md) API operation. The
following tabs provide a procedure for creating a ServiceNow plugin using the
console and code examples for the AWS CLI.

Console

**To create a ServiceNow plugin**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q
    console.

2. From the Amazon Q console, in
    **Applications**, select the name of your
    application from the list of applications.

3. From the left navigation menu, choose
    **Actions**, and then choose
    **Plugins**.

4. For **Plugins**, choose **Add**
**plugin**.

5. For **Add plugins**, choose
    **ServiceNow**.

6. For **ServiceNow**, enter the following
    information:
1. In **Plugin name**, for
       **Name** – A name for your
       Amazon Q plugin. The name can include hyphens
       (-), but not spaces, and can have a maximum of 1,000
       alphanumeric characters.

2. In **Domain URL**, for
       **URL** – Enter your
       ServiceNow domain URL. For example,
       `https://yourInstanceId.service-now.com`.

3. **OAuth 2.0 authentication** – do
       the following:
      1. For **AWS Secrets Manager secret** –
          Choose **Create and add a new**
         **secret** or **Use an existing**
         **one**. Your secret must contain the
          following information:

- **Secret name** – A
name for your Secrets Manager secret.

- **Client ID**
– The client ID generated when you create
your OAuth 2.0 application in
ServiceNow.

- **Client**
**secret** – The client secret
generated when you create your OAuth 2.0
application in ServiceNow.

- For **Redirect**
**URL** – The URL to which user
needs to be redirected after authentication. If
your deployed web url is
`<q-endpoint>`, use
`<q-endpoint>/oauth/callback` .
Amazon Q Business will handle OAuth tokens
in this URL. This callback URL needs to be
allowlisted in your third-party
application.

      2. For **Access token**
         **URL** – For ServiceNow
          OAuth applications, this is
          `https://yourInstanceId.service-now.com/oauth_token.do`.

      3. For **Authorization**
         **URL** – For ServiceNow
          OAuth applications, this is
          `https://yourInstanceId.service-now.com/oauth_auth.do`.
4. **Service access** – Choose
       **Create and add a new service role**
       or **Use an existing service role**. Make
       sure tha your service role has the necessary
       permissions.
7. **Tags – _optional_**
    – An optional tag to track your plugin.

8. Choose **Save**.
