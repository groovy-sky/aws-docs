# Connecting Amazon Q Business data source connectors
<a name="supported-connectors"></a>

**Note**
Before you connect an Amazon Q Business data source to your application, you [must add an index and retriever](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/select-retriever.html) to it.

To connect a data source to your Amazon Q Business application environment, you can use the AWS Management Console or the [CreateDataSource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_CreateDataSource.html) API operation.

By using the `CreateDataSource` API operation, you can configure tags, sync run schedules, and configure Amazon VPC settings. Then, you can use the `configuration` parameter to provide all other configuration information specific to your data source connector.

**Note**
This procedure is available if you chose to [add a new Amazon Q Business index](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/native-retriever.html) to your application environment.

This section contains an overview of data source connector features, recommended best practices for configuration, and configuration information specific to your data source connector.
