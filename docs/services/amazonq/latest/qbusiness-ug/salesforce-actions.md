# Configuring a Salesforce plugin for Amazon Q Business

Salesforce is a customer relationship management (CRM) tool for managing customer
interactions. If you’re a Salesforce user, you can create an Amazon Q Business
plugin to allow your end users to perform the following actions from within their web
experience chat:

- Managing cases (create, delete, update, get)

- Retrieving account lists

- Handling opportunities (create, update, delete, get, fetch specific)

- Fetching specific contacts

###### Note

The Salesforce plugin returns a maximum of 5 items per query to manage response size and performance.

To set up this plugin, you'll need configuration details from your Salesforce instance to
connect Amazon Q Business with Salesforce.

For more information on how to use plugins during your web experience chat, see [Using\
plugins](using-plugins.md).

- [Service access roles](#salesforce-plugin-iam)

- [Creating a plugin](#salesforce-plugin-create)

## Prerequisites

Before you configure your Amazon Q Salesforce plugin, you must do
the following:

- As an admin, create a new OAuth 2.0 Salesforce app in the
Salesforce developer console with scoped permissions for performing
actions in Amazon Q. To learn how to do this, see [Create a Connected App in Salesforce for OAuth](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.ev_relay_create_connected_app.htm&type=5) in
Salesforce Developer Documentation.

- Make sure to select **Yes** for **Enable**
**Authorization Code and Credential Flow**, **Require Secret**
**for Web Server Flow**, **Require Secret for Refresh Token**
**Flow**, **Enable Token Exchange Flow**, and
**Require Secret for Token Exchange Flow**.

- Make sure that the following required scopes are added:

- `visualforce`

- `address`

- `custom_permissions`

- `open_id`

- `profile`

- `refresh_token`

- `wave_api`

- `web`

- `phome`

- `offline_access`

- `chatter_api`

- `id`

- `api`

- `eclair_api`

- `email`

- `pardot_api`

- `full`

- Note the domain URL of your Salesforce instance. For example:
`https://yourInstance.my.salesforce.com/services/data/v60.0`.

- Note your:

- **Access token URL** – For
Salesforce OAuth applications, this is
`https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token`.

- **Authorization URL** – For
Salesforce OAuth applications, this is
`https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize`.

- **Redirect URL** – The URL to
which user needs to be redirected after authentication. If your deployed
web url is `<q-endpoint>`, use
`<q-endpoint>/oauth/callback` . Amazon Q Business will handle OAuth tokens in this URL. This callback
URL needs to be allowlisted in your third-party application.

- **Client ID** – The client ID
generated when you create your OAuth 2.0 application in
Salesforce.

- **Client secret** – The client
secret generated when you create your OAuth 2.0 application in
Salesforce.

You will need this authentication information during the plugin configuration
process.

###### Note

The Require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) extension option is not supported and it must be disabled in the Salesforce Connector application.

## Service access roles

To successfully connect Amazon Q to Salesforce, you need to give Amazon Q
the following permission to access your Secrets Manager secret to get your Salesforce
credentials. Amazon Q assumes this role to access
your Salesforce credentials.

The following is the service access IAM role required:

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:secretsmanager:{{your-region}}:{{your-account-id}}:secret:[[secret-id]]"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

To allow Amazon Q to assume a role, use the following trust policy:

```json

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "QBusinessApplicationTrustPolicy",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "qbusiness.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:SourceAccount": "{{source_account}}"
        },
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:SourceArn":"arn:aws:qbusiness:{{your-region}}:{{source_account}}:application/{{application_id}}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

If you use the console and choose to create a new IAM role,
Amazon Q creates the role for you. If you use the console and choose
to use an existing secret, or you use the API, make sure your IAM role contains these
permissions.

## Creating a plugin

To create a Salesforce plugin for your web experience chat, you can use the
AWS Management Console or the [CreatePlugin](../api-reference/api-createplugin.md) API operation. The
following tabs provide a procedure for creating a Salesforce plugin using the
console and code examples for the AWS CLI.

Console

**To create a Salesforce plugin**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q
    console.

2. From the Amazon Q console, in
    **Applications**, select the name of your
    application from the list of applications.

3. From the left navigation menu, choose
    **Actions**, and then choose
    **Plugins**.

4. For **Plugins**, choose **Add**
**plugin**.

5. For **Add plugins**, choose
    **Salesforce**.

6. For **Salesforce**, enter the following
    information:
1. In **Plugin name**, for
       **Name** – A name for your
       Amazon Q plugin. The name can include hyphens
       (-), but not spaces, and can have a maximum of 1,000
       alphanumeric characters.

2. In **Domain URL**, for
       **URL** – Enter your
       Salesforce domain URL. For example,
       `https://yourInstance.my.salesforce.com/services/data/v60.0`.

3. **OAuth 2.0 authentication** – do
       the following:
      1. For **AWS Secrets Manager secret** –
          Choose **Create and add a new**
         **secret** or **Use an existing**
         **one**. Your secret must contain the
          following information:

- **Secret name** – A
name for your Secrets Manager secret.

- **Client ID**
– The client ID generated when you create
your OAuth 2.0 application in
Salesforce.

- **Client**
**secret** – The client secret
generated when you create your OAuth 2.0
application in Salesforce.

- For **Redirect**
**URL** – The URL to which user
needs to be redirected after authentication. If
your deployed web url is
`<q-endpoint>`, use
`<q-endpoint>/oauth/callback` .
Amazon Q Business will handle OAuth tokens
in this URL. This callback URL needs to be
allowlisted in your third-party
application.

      2. For **Access token**
         **URL** – For Salesforce
          OAuth applications, this is
          `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token`.

      3. For **Authorization**

          OAuth applications, this is
          `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize`.
4. **Service access** – Choose
       **Create and add a new service role**
       or **Use an existing service role**. Make
       sure tha your service role has the necessary
       permissions.
7. **Tags – _optional_**
    – An optional tag to track your plugin.

8. Choose **Save**.
