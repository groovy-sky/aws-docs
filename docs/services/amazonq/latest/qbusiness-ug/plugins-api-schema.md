# Defining OpenAPI schemas for custom plugins

Amazon Q Business uses the configured third-party OpenAPI specifications to
dynamically determine which API operations to perform in order to fulfill an end user
requests. To configure a custom plugin you must define at least 1 API operation and a
maximum of 20 API operations that can be invoked. To define the API operations, create
an OpenAPI schema in JSON or YAML format. You can create OpenAPI schema files and upload
them to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Alternatively, you can use the
OpenAPI text editor in the console, which will validate your schema.

This section will first cover the required definitions for the OpenAPI schema. The
next section will cover [best practices and examples for configuring OpenAPI schema\
definitions](plugins-api-schema-best-practices.md) to maximize the accuracy of your Amazon Q Business custom
plugins. For more details about OpenAPI schemas, see [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification) on the
Swagger website.

## OpenAPI Schema definitions for custom plugins

The following is the general format of an OpenAPI schema for a custom
plugin.

```json

{
    "openapi": "3.0.0",
    "servers": [
    {
      "url": "https://api.example.com"
    }
  ],
    "paths": {
        "/path": {
            "method": {
                "description": "string",
                "operationId": "string",
                "parameters": [ ... ],
                "requestBody": { ... },
                "responses": { ... },
                "security": [ ... ]
           }
       }
    },
    "security": [
        {
            "OAuth2": ["read", "write"]
        }
    ],
    "components": {
    "securitySchemes": {}
 }
}
```

The following list describes fields in the OpenAPI schema

- `openapi` – (Required) The version of OpenAPI that's
being used. This value must be `"3.0.0"` or higher for custom
plugins.

- `servers` – (Required) The identifier for application
connectivity from API clients. This is required for the custom plugin call
to succeed.

- `paths` – (Required) Contains relative paths to
individual endpoints. Each path must begin with a forward slash
( `/`). Amazon Q Business supports only one configured
endpoint per custom plugin.

- `method` – (Required) Defines the method to use.

- `securitySchemes` – (Optional) Defines the OAuth security
parameters.

- `security` – (Required when using authentication) Defines
which security schemes are applied to the whole API or specific operations.
This is required when using OAuth authentication.

Minimally, each method requires the following fields:

- `description` – A description of the API operation. Use
this field to let the custom plugin know when to call this API operation and
what the operation does.

- `responses` – Contains properties that the custom plugin
returns in the API response. The custom plugin uses the response properties
to construct prompts, accurately process the results of an API call, and
determine a correct set of steps for performing an action.

The fields within the following two objects provide more information for your
custom plugin to effectively select API operations that are needed to fulfill an end
user request. For each field, set the value of the `required` field to
`true` if required and to `false` if optional.

- `parameters` – Contains information about parameters that
can be included in the request.

- `requestBody` – Contains the fields in the request body
for the operation. Don't include this field for `GET` and
`DELETE` methods.

For details on configuring the fields review the following sections:

### OpenAPI Schema responses

The following is a sample response.

```json

"responses": {
    "200": {
        "content": {
            "<media type>": {
                "schema": {
                    "properties": {
                        "<property>": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "string"
                        },
                        ...
                    }
                }
            }
        },
    },
    ...
}
```

Each key in the `responses` object is a response code, which
describes the status of the response. The response code maps to an object that
contains the following information for the response:

- `content` – (Required for each response) The content
of the response.

- `<media type>` – The format of
the response body. At this time, only `application/json` is
supported by custom plugins. For more information, see [Media\
types](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/media-types) on the Swagger website.

- `schema` – (Required for each media type) Defines the
data type of the response body and its fields.

- `properties` – (Required if there are
`items` in the schema) Your custom plugins uses
properties that you define in the schema to determine the information it
needs to return to the end user in order to fulfill a task. Each
property contains the following fields:

- `type` – (Required for each property) The
data type of the response field.

- `description` – (Optional) Describes the
property. The custom plugin can use this information to
determine the information that it needs to return to the end
user.

### OpenAPI Schema parameters

The following are examples of parameters.

```json

"parameters": [
    {
        "name": "string", // e.g. "userName"
        "description": "string",
        "required": boolean,
        "x-amzn-form-display-name": "string" // e.g. "User Name"
        "schema": {
            ...
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "string", // e.g. "employeeId"
        "description": "string",
        "required": boolean,
        "x-amzn-form-hide": boolean //e.g. true
        "schema": {
            ...
        }
    }
    ...
]
```

Your custom plugin uses the following fields to determine the information it
must get from the end user to perform the plugin's requirements.

- `name` – (Required) The name of the parameter.

- `description` – (Required) A description of the
parameter. Use this field to help the plugin to understand how to elicit
this parameter from the user or determine that it already has that
parameter value from prior actions or from the user’s request to the
custom plugin.

- `required` – (Optional) Whether the parameter is
required for the API request. Use this field to indicate to the custom
plugin whether this parameter is needed for every invocation or if it's
optional.

- `schema` – (Optional) The definition of input and
output data types. For more information, see [Data Models\
(Schemas)](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models) on the Swagger website.

- Extension support – (Optional) For a write API operation, an
Amazon Q Business custom plugin may dynamically create a confirmation form that
is presented to end users. This form allows users to confirm and/or
correct parameters Amazon Q populated based on the end user’s request
or past actions. The following extensions can be used to modify how that
form is created:

- `x-amzn-form-display-name` – (Optional) This
can be used at parameter level to override the default name
visible in the form.

- `x-amzn-form-hide` – (Optional) This can be
used to hide a parameter from being displayed in the user facing
form.

- Schemas containing composition keywords ( `allOf`,
`not`, `oneOf`, or `anyOf`) are not
supported.

- Schemas containing array types are not supported. For example, schemas
such as `{"type": "array", "items": {"string"}}` are not
supported.

### OpenAPI Schema request body

The following is the general structure of a `requestBody`
field:

```json

"requestBody": {
    "required": boolean,
    "content": {
        "<media type>": {
            "schema": {
                "properties": {
                    "<property>": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "string"
                    },
                    ...
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The following list describes each field:

- `required` – (Optional) Whether the request body is
required for the API request.

- `content` – (Required) The content of the request
body.

- `<media type>` – (Optional) The
format of the request body. At this time, only
`application/json` is supported by custom plugins. For
more information, see [Media\
types](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/media-types) on the Swagger website.

- `schema` – (Optional) Defines the data type of the
request body and its fields.

- `properties` – (Optional) Your custom plugin uses
properties that you define in the schema to determine the information it
must get from the end user to make the API request. Each property
contains the following fields:

- `type` – (Optional) The data type of the
request field.

- `description` – (Optional) Describes the
property. The custom plugin can use this information to
determine the information it needs to return to the end
user.

- Schemas containing composition keywords ( `allOf`,
`not`, `oneOf`, or `anyOf`) are not
supported.

- Schemas containing array types are not supported. For example, schemas
such as `{"type": "array", "items": {"string"}}` are not
supported.

### OpenAPI Schema security schemes

Following is the general structure of a `securityScheme`
field:

```json

"securitySchemes": {
      "OAuth2": {
        "type": "oauth2",
        "flows": {
          "authorizationCode": {
            "authorizationUrl": "https://example.com/oauth/authorize",
            "tokenUrl": "https://example.com/oauth/token",
            "scopes": {
              "read": "Read access to resources",
              "write": "Write access to resources"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

If your API requires OAuth authorization, the OpenAPI schema needs to include
security schemes. We support the following authorization code flow of
OAuth:

- `type` – Must be `oauth2`.

- `flows` – Must contain
`authorizationCode`.

- `authorizationUrl` – The URL to which the user will
be sent to begin the authorization process.

- `tokenUrl` – (Optional) The URL that the custom
plugin will use to exchange the authorization code for an access
token.

- `scopes` – Defines the permissions that the custom
plugin will request.

Successful authorization using OAuth also requires an OAuth client ID, client
secret, and a redirect url. These will need to be provided as secrets when
creating the custom plugin.
