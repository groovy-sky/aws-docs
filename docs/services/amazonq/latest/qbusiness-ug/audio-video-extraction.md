# Extracting semantic meaning from audio and video content
<a name="Audio-video-extraction"></a>

Amazon Q Business extracts semantic information from audio and video files, making data sources queryable and enhancing information retrieval.

## Capabilities
<a name="audio-video-extraction-capabilities"></a>
+ Processes up to 10 GB of video and 2 GB of audio
+ Builds a comprehensive knowledge base

## Enabling Content Extraction
<a name="audio-video-extraction-content-extraction"></a>
+ Use the Amazon Q Business console or API
+ Available when adding connectors or importing files

## Audio and video extraction
<a name="audio-video-extraction-av-exct"></a>

**The System extracts the following from audio and video files:**
+ Transcribed text from audio voice content
+ Time-stamped indexing of content
+ Summary and theme detection

**Important**
Processing multimedia content takes longer than text-only documents. Incremental sync mode is recommended for multimedia processing.

Query audio and video content using natural language, and explore deeper with follow-up questions.

## Processing Considerations
