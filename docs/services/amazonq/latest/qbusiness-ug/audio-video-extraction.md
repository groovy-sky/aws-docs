# Extracting semantic meaning from audio and video content

Amazon Q Business extracts semantic information from audio and video files,
making data sources queryable and enhancing information retrieval.

## Capabilities

- Processes up to 10 GB of video and 2 GB of audio

- Builds a comprehensive knowledge base

## Enabling Content Extraction

- Use the Amazon Q Business console or API

- Available when adding connectors or importing files

## Audio and video extraction

###### The System extracts the following from audio and video files:

- Transcribed text from audio voice content

- Time-stamped indexing of content

- Summary and theme detection

###### Important

Processing multimedia content takes longer than text-only documents.
Incremental sync mode is recommended for multimedia processing.

Query audio and video content using natural language, and explore deeper with
follow-up questions.

## Processing Considerations

- Audio and video files take longer to process than text-only files

- Amazon Q Business doesn't charge for re-synchronizations (re-syncs) when content
remains unchanged.

## Additional Information

- For sync modes, see [Sync mode](connector-concepts.md#connector-sync-mode)

- For pricing details, see [Amazon Q Business\

## Ingest Audio/Video documents using the console

1. Login to your personal AWS account

2. Create a new application or use an existing application

### Ingest Audio/Video files using direct upload

Open the application, whether it is a newly created application or an application
you have used previously:

1. Click **Add data source**

2. Select the **Upload Files** option

3. Upload a supported Audio/Video file

4. In the **File Indexing Configuration**, select the
    audio/video files option based on the files you uploaded

5. Click the upload button on the bottom right corner

6. Monitor the uploaded file source under the data source tab. The status
    will update in sequence: "Received" => "Processing" => "Indexed/Updated"

7. Once the status is Indexed/Updated, it means your file is indexed
    successfully

###### Note

For file uploads, the Audio/Video size limit is consistent with the general
file size limit of 50 MB.

### Ingest Audio/Video documents using data source
