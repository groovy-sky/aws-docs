# Using Amazon VPC with an Amazon S3 data source

This topic describes the requirements for connecting Amazon Q Business
to an Amazon Simple Storage Service through Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. It outlines the
necessary prerequisites, including VPC configuration and S3 endpoint setup, to
enable Amazon Q Business to access Amazon S3 buckets through a
private connection.

###### Important

So that an Amazon Q Business
Amazon S3 connector can access your Amazon S3 bucket, make
sure that you have assigned an Amazon S3 endpoint to your virtual
private cloud (VPC). For more information about configuring an Amazon Q Business
Amazon S3 connector with Amazon VPC, see [Using Amazon VPC with Amazon S3](s3-connector.md#s3-vpc).

For Amazon Q Business to sync documents from your Amazon S3
bucket through Amazon VPC, you must complete the following steps:

- Set up an Amazon S3 endpoint for Amazon VPC. For more
information about how to set up an Amazon S3 endpoint, see
[Gateway endpoints for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html)
in the _AWS PrivateLink Guide_.

- (Optional) Checked your Amazon S3 bucket policies to make sure
that the Amazon S3 bucket is accessible from the virtual private
cloud (VPC) that you assigned to Amazon Q Business. For more
information, see [Controlling access from VPC endpoints with bucket policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies-vpc-endpoint.html)
in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

For more information about how to configure Amazon VPC security
groups, see [Security group rules](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/security-group-rules.md) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.
