# Connecting using the legacy Microsoft Teams connector (Console)

The legacy Microsoft Teams connector provides comprehensive configuration options including entity type selection, field mappings, and VPC settings. Use this procedure to connect Amazon Q Business to Microsoft Teams using the legacy connector.

###### To connect Amazon Q to Microsoft Teams using the legacy connector

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business
     console.

02. From the left navigation menu, choose **Data**
    **sources**.

03. From the **Data sources** page, choose
     **Add data source**.

04. Then, on the **Add data sources** page, from
     **Data sources**, add the **Microsoft Teams** data source to your Amazon Q application.

05. Then, on the **Microsoft Teams** data source page, enter
     the following information:

06. **Name and description**, do the following:

- For **Data source name** – Name your data
source for easy tracking.

###### Note

You can include hyphens (-) but
not spaces. Maximum of 1,000 alphanumeric characters.

- **Description –**
**_optional_** – Add an optional
description for your data source. This text is viewed only by Amazon Q Business administrators and can be edited later.

07. In **Source**, enter the following information:
    1. **Tenant ID** – Enter your Tenant ID.

       ###### Note

       Your Microsoft Tenant ID is a globally unique identifier that's
       necessary to configure each connector instance. Your Tenant ID is
       different from your organization name or domain and can be found in
       the **Properties** section of your Azure
       Active Directory Portal.
08. **Authorization** – Amazon Q Business crawls ACL information by default to ensure responses are generated only from
     documents your end users have access to. If supported for your connector, you can manage ACLs by selecting **Enable ACLs** to enable ACLs or **Disable ACLs** to disable them.
     To manage ACLs, you need specific IAM permissions. See [Grant permission to create data sources with ACLs disabled](setting-up.md#DisableAclOnDataSource) for more details.

     See [Authorization](connector-concepts.md#connector-authorization) for more details.

09. For **Authentication**, in **AWS Secrets Manager**
     – Choose between **Create and add new secret** and
     **Use existing secrets**.
    1. If you choose **Use existing secrets**, select an

        can't edit these.

    2. **Custom** – Automatically created by
        Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
        can edit these. You can also create and add new custom fields.

       ###### Note

       Support for adding custom fields varies by connector. You
       won't see the **Add field** option if your

        instances are required.

For more information, see [VPC](connector-concepts.md#connector-vpc).

17. In **Sync run schedule**, for
     **Frequency** – Choose how often
     Amazon Q will sync with your data
     source. For more details, see [Sync run schedule](connector-concepts.md#connector-sync-run). To learn how to start a data sync job,
     see [Starting data source connector sync jobs](supported-datasource-actions.md#start-datasource-sync-jobs).

18. **Tags - _optional_** –
     Add tags to search and filter your resources or track your AWS costs. See [Tags](tagging.md) for more details.

19. In **Data source details**, choose **Sync**
    **now** to allow Amazon Q to begin syncing (crawling and
     ingesting) data from your data source. When the sync job finishes, your data
     source is ready to use.

    ###### Note

    View CloudWatch logs for your data source sync job by selecting **View**
    **CloudWatch logs**. If you encounter a `Resource not found
                                exception` error, wait and try again as logs may not be available
    immediately.

    You can also view a detailed document-level report by selecting
    **View Report**. This report shows the status of each
    document during the crawl, sync, and index stages, including any errors. If
    the report is empty for an in-progress job, check back later as data is
    emitted to the report as events occur during the sync process.

    connectors](troubleshooting-data-sources.md#troubleshooting-data-sources-not-indexed).
