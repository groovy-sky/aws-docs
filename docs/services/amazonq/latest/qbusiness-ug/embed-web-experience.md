# Add Amazon Q embedded to your website
<a name="embed-web-experience"></a>

You can embed your Amazon Q Business web experience by adding an `<iframe>` element to your website with the **Deployed URL** or `defaultEndpoint` you copied earlier as the `src` value and a minimum width of *450 pixels* as follows.

```
<iframe src="{{Deployed-URL-or-defaultEndpoint}}" style="min-width: 450px;"/>
```

Once this <iframe> is added to the website, the Amazon Q Business chat assistant will show up and be ready to be used by your authenticated Amazon Q users.

Amazon Q Business users must provide user authentication credentials before they can use the embedded Amazon Q chat experience on your website. These credentials are the same as the credentials required for the Amazon Q web experience. To authenticate, Amazon Q opens a new browser tab or window where users can enter their credentials. Once successfully authenticated, users can close this tab or window and begin using the embedded Amazon Q chat experience within the website.

**Note**
For [anonymous applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/create-anonymous-application.html), the **Deployed URL** must be generated every time using the `[ CreateAnonymousWebExperienceUrl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_CreateAnonymousWebExperienceUrl.html)` API operation. For more information, see [Share an anonymous web experience](supported-exp-actions-anonymous.md#create-experience-anonymous-url).
If your browser has a limited cookie mode (ex. Incognito mode in Chrome), you may have to enable third-party cookies for Amazon Q embedded to work.
 The button for copying may not work without `allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"` attribute added to iframe
