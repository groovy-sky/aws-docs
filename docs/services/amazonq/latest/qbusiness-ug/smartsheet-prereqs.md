# Prerequisites for connecting Amazon Q Business to Smartsheet
<a name="smartsheet-prereqs"></a>

Before you begin, make sure that you have completed the following prerequisites.
+ **In Smartsheet, make sure you have:**
  + Access to the Smartsheet Event Reporting API. Use the [Events API Access Request](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/5db2cf1b981f445cabaa22d9421cc19d) form to request access for your organization.
  + An Smartsheet system admin user or a licensed user for Smartsheet who can generate an access token. With this access token, your connector will have access to crawl all sheets and workspaces created by or shared with this user.
  + A Smartsheet access token. You need this to connect Smartsheet to Amazon Q Business. For information on how to generate this token in Smartsheet, see [Authentication and Access Tokens](https://smartsheet.redoc.ly/#section/API-Basics/Authentication-and-Access-Tokens) in the *Smartsheet API Reference*.
+ **In your AWS account, make sure you have:**
  + Created a Amazon Q Business application.
  + Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/select-retriever.html).
  + Created an [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/iam-roles.html#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.
  + Stored your Smartsheet authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the secret.
**Note**
If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the console.

  For a list of things to consider while configuring your data source, see [ Data source connector configuration best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/connector-best-practices.html).
