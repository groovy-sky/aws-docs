# Understanding Amazon Q Business User Store
<a name="connector-principal-store"></a>

With the Amazon Q Business *User Store* feature, end users see Amazon Q Business chat responses generated *only* from the documents that they have access to within an Amazon Q Business application. To achieve this, Amazon Q creates a mapping within the data sources attached to that application. The mapping is between every unique user accessing the application environment and all the user IDs and user groups that they are associated with. Amazon Q Business stores this principal mapping information in its internal User Store. During chat, Amazon Q Business uses the mapping information to return answers that are scoped to a user’s identity.

When you use the API, you use the User Store API actions to customize and configure your user management solution. For more details, see [Using User Store APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/principal-store-hiw.html#principal-store-hiw-api).

When you use the console, Amazon Q Business automatically crawls user and group information during the connector setup process. You can't create, add, or customize users and groups to the user store using the AWS Management Console.

**Note**
As of Dec 17, 2024, Amazon Q Business will recognize all email addresses as case-insensitive and recognize subaddresses as equivalent to the original email address. For example, JohnDoe@example.com, johndoe@example.com, and johndoe\+work@example.com will be considered the same email address. For assistance with applications or to report a concern, contact Support sign into the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/) .

**Note**
The User Store feature is not available for the Amazon S3 and Amazon Q Web Crawler connectors that are used with Amazon Q Business. For more information about using access control information for user identity specific chat responses for these connectors, see [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/s3-connector.html#s3-user-management) and [Amazon Q Business Web Crawler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/connector-webcrawler.html).
