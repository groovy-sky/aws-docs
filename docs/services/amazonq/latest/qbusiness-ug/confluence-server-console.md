       ###### Note

       **Page comments** and **Page**
       **attachments** can only be selected if you choose to
       sync **Pages**. **Blog comments**
       and **Blog attachments** can only be selected if
       you choose to sync **Blogs**.

       ###### Important

       You can crawl **Pages** and
       **Blogs** from one of more specific
       **Spaces**. If you don't specify a
       **Space key** regex pattern in
       **Additional configuration**, all
       **Pages** and **Blogs** will
       be crawled by default. If no **Space** is specified
       in the filter, all spaces will be crawled.

    2. For **Maximum file size** – Specify the file
        size limit in MBs that Amazon Q will crawl. Amazon Q will crawl only
        the files within the size limit you define. The default file size is
        50MB. The maximum file size should be greater than 0MB and less than or
        equal to 50MB.

    3. In **Additional configuration –**
       **_optional_**, for **Space**
       **and regex patterns**, specify whether to include or exclude
        specific spaces, URLs, or file types in your index using the
        following:

- **Space key** – For example,
`my-space-123`. Select
**Add** after entering each space key you
want to add.

###### Note

If you don't specify a **Space key**
regex pattern in **Additional**
**configuration**, all **Pages**
and **Blogs** will be crawled by default.
If no **Space** is specified in the filter,
all spaces will be crawled.

- **URL** – For example,
`.*/MySite/MyDocuments/`. Select
**Add** after entering each URL you want to
add.

- **File type** – For example,
`.*\.pdf` or
`.*\.txt`. Select
**Add** after entering each file type you
want to add.

- For **Entity title regex patterns** –
Specify regular expression patterns to include or exclude
certain **Blogs**, **Pages**,
**Comments**, and
**Attachments** by titles.

###### Note

If you want to crawl a specific page or subpage, you can use page
title regex patterns to either include or exclude this page.

    4. **Multi-media content configuration – optional** –
        To enable content extraction from embedded images and visuals in documents, choose **Visual content in documents**.

       To extract audio transcriptions and video content, enable processing for the following file types:

       **Document deletion safeguard** \- _optional_–To safeguard
        your documents from deletion during a sync job, select **On** and enter an integer between 0 - 100. If
        the percentage of documents to be deleted in your sync job exceeds the percentage you selected, the
        delete phase will be skipped and no documents from this data source will be deleted from your index. For more information, see
        [Document deletion safeguard](connector-concepts.md#document-deletion-safeguard).
10. For **Sync mode**, choose how you want to update your index
     when your data source content changes. When you sync your data source with
     Amazon Q for the first time, all content is synced by
     default.

- **Full sync** – Sync all content regardless of
the previous sync status.

- **New, modified, or deleted content sync** –
Sync only new, modified, and deleted documents.

11. In **Sync run schedule**, for
     **Frequency** – Choose how often
     Amazon Q will sync with your data
     source. For more details, see [Sync run schedule](connector-concepts.md#connector-sync-run). To learn how to start a data sync job,
     see [Starting data source connector sync jobs](supported-datasource-actions.md#start-datasource-sync-jobs).

12. **Tags - _optional_** –
     Add tags to search and filter your resources or track your AWS costs. See [Tags](tagging.md) for more details.

13. **Field mappings** – A list of data source document
     attributes to map to your index fields.

    ###### Note

    Add or update the fields from the **Data**
    **source details** page after you finish adding your data source.

    You can choose from two types of fields:

    1. **Default** – Automatically created by
        Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
        can't edit these.

    2. **Custom** – Automatically created by
        Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
        can edit these. You can also create and add new custom fields.

       ###### Note

       Support for adding custom fields varies by connector. You
       won't see the **Add field** option if your
       connector doesn't support adding custom fields.

For more information, see [Field mappings](connector-concepts.md#connector-field-mappings).

14. In **Data source details**, choose **Sync**
    **now** to allow Amazon Q to begin syncing (crawling and
     ingesting) data from your data source. When the sync job finishes, your data
     source is ready to use.

    ###### Note

    View CloudWatch logs for your data source sync job by selecting **View**
    **CloudWatch logs**. If you encounter a `Resource not found
                                exception` error, wait and try again as logs may not be available
    immediately.

    You can also view a detailed document-level report by selecting
    **View Report**. This report shows the status of each
    document during the crawl, sync, and index stages, including any errors. If
    the report is empty for an in-progress job, check back later as data is
    emitted to the report as events occur during the sync process.

    For more information, see [Troubleshooting data source\
    connectors](troubleshooting-data-sources.md#troubleshooting-data-sources-not-indexed).
