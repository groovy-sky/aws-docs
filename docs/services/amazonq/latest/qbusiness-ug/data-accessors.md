# Share your enterprise data with data accessors using Amazon Q index

The Amazon Q Business data accessors feature allows you to securely share your enterprise data
with verified independent software vendors (ISVs) using Amazon Q. This feature allows ISVs to
retrieve relevant content from your Amazon Q index, enhancing their applications with your
organization's knowledge. By granting controlled access to your data, you can leverage
third-party tools while maintaining security and data access compliance.

DataAccessor supports two types of authorization patterns to access ISVs end user data on
Amazon Q:

- [Authorization Code](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/05/aws-iam-identity-pkce-authorizations-aws-applications)

AWS IAM Identity Center supports OAuth 2.0 authorization code flows using the
Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) standard. This provides AWS applications, such
as Amazon Q Business, a simple and safe way to authenticate users and obtain their consent
to access Amazon Q Business resources from desktops and mobile devices with web
browsers.

- [Trusted token issuer/App level authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/using-apps-with-trusted-token-issuer.html#trusted-token-issuer-overview)

- A trusted token issuer is an OAuth 2.0 authorization server that creates
signed tokens. These tokens authorize applications that initiate requests
(requesting applications) for access to AWS managed applications
(receiving applications).

This topic discusses how an Amazon Q Business administrator can connect to one of the supported
data accessors.
