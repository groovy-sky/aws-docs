# CreatePresignedUrl

Creates a presigned URL for an S3 POST operation to upload a file. You can use this URL to
set a default file for a `FileUploadCard` in a Q App definition or to provide a
file for a single Q App run. The `scope` parameter determines how the file will be
used, either at the app definition level or the app session level.

###### Note

The IAM permissions are derived from the `qapps:ImportDocument` action. For more information on the IAM policy for Amazon Q Apps, see [IAM permissions for using Amazon Q Apps](../qbusiness-ug/deploy-q-apps-iam-permissions.md).
