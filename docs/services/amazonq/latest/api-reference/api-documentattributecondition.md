# DocumentAttributeCondition

The condition used for the target document attribute or metadata field when ingesting
documents into Amazon Q Business. You use this with [`DocumentAttributeTarget`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_DocumentAttributeTarget.html) to apply the condition.

For example, you can create the 'Department' target field and have it prefill
department names associated with the documents based on information in the 'Source\_URI'
field. Set the condition that if the 'Source\_URI' field contains 'financial' in its URI
value, then prefill the target field 'Department' with the target value 'Finance' for
the document.

Amazon Q Business can't create a target field if it has not already been created as an
index field. After you create your index field, you can create a document metadata field
using `DocumentAttributeTarget`. Amazon Q Business then will map your newly
created metadata field to your index field.
