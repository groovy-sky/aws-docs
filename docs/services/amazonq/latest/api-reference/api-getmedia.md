Amazon Q Business will no longer be open to new customers starting on July 31, 2026. If you would like to use the service, please sign up prior to July 30.

If you have implemented your own application with the Chat and ChatSync APIs, and have enabled content extraction from visual data in Amazon Q Business, you use the GetMedia API operation to download the images so you can show them in your UI with responses.
