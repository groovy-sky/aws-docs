# DeleteGroup

Deletes a group so that all users and sub groups that belong to the group can no
longer access documents only available to that group. For example, after deleting the
group "Summer Interns", all interns who belonged to that group no longer see intern-only
documents in their chat results.

If you want to delete, update, or replace users or sub groups of a group, you need to
use the `PutGroup` operation. For example, if a user in the group
"Engineering" leaves the engineering team and another user takes their place, you
provide an updated list of users or sub groups that belong to the "Engineering" group
when calling `PutGroup`.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

DELETE /applications/applicationId/indices/indexId/groups/groupName?dataSourceId=dataSourceId HTTP/1.1

```

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[applicationId](#API_DeleteGroup_RequestSyntax)**

The identifier of the application in which the group mapping belongs.

Required: Yes

**[dataSourceId](#API_DeleteGroup_RequestSyntax)**

The identifier of the data source linked to the group

A group can be tied to multiple data sources. You can delete a group from accessing
documents in a certain data source. For example, the groups "Research", "Engineering",
and "Sales and Marketing" are all tied to the company's documents stored in the data
sources Confluence and Salesforce. You want to delete "Research" and "Engineering"
groups from Salesforce, so that these groups cannot access customer-related documents
stored in Salesforce. Only "Sales and Marketing" should access documents in the
Salesforce data source.
