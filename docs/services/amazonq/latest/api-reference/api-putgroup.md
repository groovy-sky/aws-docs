# PutGroup

Create, or updates, a mapping of users—who have access to a document—to
groups.

You can also map sub groups to groups. For example, the group "Company Intellectual
Property Teams" includes sub groups "Research" and "Engineering". These sub groups
include their own list of users or people who work in these teams. Only users who work
in research and engineering, and therefore belong in the intellectual property group,
can see top-secret company documents in their Amazon Q Business chat results.

There are two options for creating groups, either passing group members inline or
using an S3 file via the S3PathForGroupMembers field. For inline groups, there is a
limit of 1000 members per group and for provided S3 files there is a limit of 100
thousand members. When creating a group using an S3 file, you provide both an S3 file
and a `RoleArn` for Amazon Q Buisness to access the file.

in the data sources Confluence and Salesforce. However, "Sales and Marketing" team only
