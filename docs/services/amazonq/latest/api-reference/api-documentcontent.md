# DocumentContent
<a name="API_DocumentContent"></a>

**Note**
Documents have size limitations. The maximum file size for a document is 500 MB (for PDF, Word, Powerpoint) or 50 MB (for all other file types). The maximum amount of text that can be extracted from a single document is 30 MB. For more information, see [Supported document formats in Amazon Q Business](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/doc-types.html).

## Contents
<a name="API_DocumentContent_Contents"></a>

**Important**
This data type is a UNION, so only one of the following members can be specified when used or returned.

 ** blob **   <a name="qbusiness-Type-DocumentContent-blob"></a>
The contents of the document. Documents passed to the `blob` parameter must be base64 encoded. Your code might not need to encode the document file bytes if you're using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Q Business APIs. If you are calling the Amazon Q Business endpoint directly using REST, you must base64 encode the contents before sending.
Type: Base64-encoded binary data object
Required: No

 ** s3 **   <a name="qbusiness-Type-DocumentContent-s3"></a>
The path to the document in an Amazon S3 bucket.
Type: [S3](API_S3.md) object
