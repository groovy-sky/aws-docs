# SearchRelevantContent

Searches for relevant content in a Amazon Q Business application based on a query. This
operation takes a search query text, the Amazon Q Business application identifier, and
optional filters (such as content source and maximum results) as input. It returns a
list of relevant content items, where each item includes the content text, the unique
document identifier, the document title, the document URI, any relevant document
attributes, and score attributes indicating the confidence level of the
relevance.
