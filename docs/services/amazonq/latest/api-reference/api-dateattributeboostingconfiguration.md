# DateAttributeBoostingConfiguration

For more information on how boosting document attributes work in Amazon Q Business, see
[Boosting using document attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/business-use-dg/metadata-boosting.html).

## Contents

**boostingLevel**

For version 2, this parameter indicates the relative ranking between boosted fields (ONE being highest priority, TWO being second highest, etc.) and determines the order in which attributes influence document ranking in search results. For version 1, this parameter specifies the boosting intensity. For version 2, boosting intensity (VERY HIGH, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, NONE) are not supported. Note that in version 2, you are not allowed to boost on only one field and make this value TWO.
