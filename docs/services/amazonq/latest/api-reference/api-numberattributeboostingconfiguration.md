# NumberAttributeBoostingConfiguration

Provides information on boosting `NUMBER` type document attributes.

In the current boosting implementation, boosting focuses primarily on `DATE` attributes for recency and `STRING` attributes for source prioritization. `NUMBER` attributes can serve as additional boosting factors when needed, but are not supported when using `NativeIndexConfiguration` version 2.

For more information on how boosting document attributes work in Amazon Q Business, see
[Boosting using document attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/business-use-dg/metadata-boosting.html).

## Contents

**boostingLevel**

Specifies the priority of boosted document attributes in relation to other boosted attributes.

Type: String

Valid Values: `NONE | LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | VERY_HIGH | ONE | TWO`

Required: Yes

**boostingType**
