# WorkGroupConfiguration

The configuration of the workgroup, which includes the location in Amazon S3
where query and calculation results are stored, the encryption option, if any, used for
query and calculation results, whether the Amazon CloudWatch Metrics are enabled for
the workgroup and whether workgroup settings override query settings, and the data usage
limits for the amount of data scanned per query or per workgroup. The workgroup settings
override is specified in `EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration` (true/false) in the
`WorkGroupConfiguration`. See [WorkGroupConfiguration:EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration](#athena-Type-WorkGroupConfiguration-EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration).

## Contents

**AdditionalConfiguration**

Specifies a user defined JSON string that is passed to the notebook engine.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Required: No

**BytesScannedCutoffPerQuery**

The upper data usage limit (cutoff) for the amount of bytes a single query in a
workgroup is allowed to scan.

Type: Long

Valid Range: Minimum value of 10000000.

Required: No

**CustomerContentEncryptionConfiguration**

Specifies the KMS key that is used to encrypt the user's data stores in Athena. This setting does not apply to Athena SQL workgroups.

Type: [CustomerContentEncryptionConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_CustomerContentEncryptionConfiguration.html) object

Required: No

**EnableMinimumEncryptionConfiguration**

Enforces a minimal level of encryption for the workgroup for query and calculation
results that are written to Amazon S3. When enabled, workgroup users can set
encryption only to the minimum level set by the administrator or higher when they submit
queries.

The `EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration` setting takes precedence over the
`EnableMinimumEncryptionConfiguration` flag. This means that if
`EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration` is true, the
`EnableMinimumEncryptionConfiguration` flag is ignored, and the workgroup
configuration for encryption is used.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration**

If set to "true", the settings for the workgroup override client-side settings. If set
to "false", client-side settings are used. This property is not required for Apache
Spark enabled workgroups. For more information, see [Workgroup Settings Override\
Client-Side Settings](../../../../services/athena/latest/ug/workgroups-settings-override.md).

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**EngineConfiguration**

The engine configuration for the workgroup, which includes the minimum/maximum number of Data Processing Units (DPU) that queries should use when
running in provisioned capacity. If not specified, Athena uses default values (Default value for min is 4 and for max is Minimum of 124 and allocated DPUs).

To specify DPU values for PC queries the WG containing EngineConfiguration should have the following values:
The name of the Classifications should be `athena-query-engine-properties`, with the only allowed properties as `max-dpu-count` and `min-dpu-count`.

Type: [EngineConfiguration](api-engineconfiguration.md) object

Required: No

**EngineVersion**

The engine version that all queries running on the workgroup use. Queries on the
`AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality` workgroup run on the preview engine
regardless of this setting.

Type: [EngineVersion](api-engineversion.md) object

Required: No

**ExecutionRole**

The ARN of the execution role used to access user resources for Spark sessions and
IAM Identity Center enabled workgroups. This property applies only to Spark enabled
workgroups and IAM Identity Center enabled workgroups. The property is required for
IAM Identity Center enabled workgroups.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 20. Maximum length of 2048.

Pattern: `^arn:aws[a-z\-]*:iam::\d{12}:role/?[a-zA-Z_0-9+=,.@\-_/]+$`

Required: No

**IdentityCenterConfiguration**

Specifies whether the workgroup is IAM Identity Center supported.

Type: [IdentityCenterConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_IdentityCenterConfiguration.html) object

Required: No

**ManagedQueryResultsConfiguration**

The configuration for storing results in Athena owned storage, which includes whether
this feature is enabled; whether encryption configuration, if any, is used for
encrypting query results.

Type: [ManagedQueryResultsConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_ManagedQueryResultsConfiguration.html) object

Required: No

**MonitoringConfiguration**

Contains the configuration settings for managed log persistence, delivering logs to Amazon S3 buckets,
Amazon CloudWatch log groups etc.

Type: [MonitoringConfiguration](api-monitoringconfiguration.md) object

Required: No

**PublishCloudWatchMetricsEnabled**

Indicates that the Amazon CloudWatch metrics are enabled for the workgroup.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**QueryResultsS3AccessGrantsConfiguration**

Specifies whether Amazon S3 access grants are enabled for query
results.

Type: [QueryResultsS3AccessGrantsConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_QueryResultsS3AccessGrantsConfiguration.html) object

Required: No

**RequesterPaysEnabled**

If set to `true`, allows members assigned to a workgroup to reference
Amazon S3 Requester Pays buckets in queries. If set to `false`,
workgroup members cannot query data from Requester Pays buckets, and queries that
retrieve data from Requester Pays buckets cause an error. The default is
`false`. For more information about Requester Pays buckets, see [Requester\
Pays Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer_
_Guide_.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**ResultConfiguration**

The configuration for the workgroup, which includes the location in Amazon S3
where query and calculation results are stored and the encryption option, if any, used
for query and calculation results. To run the query, you must specify the query results
location using one of the ways: either in the workgroup using this setting, or for
individual queries (client-side), using [ResultConfiguration:OutputLocation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_ResultConfiguration.html#athena-Type-ResultConfiguration-OutputLocation). If none of them is set, Athena issues an error that no output location is provided.

Type: [ResultConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_ResultConfiguration.html) object

Required: No
