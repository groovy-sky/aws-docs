# StopCalculationExecution

Requests the cancellation of a calculation. A `StopCalculationExecution`
call on a calculation that is already in a terminal state (for example,
`STOPPED`, `FAILED`, or `COMPLETED`) succeeds but
has no effect.

###### Note

Cancelling a calculation is done on a best effort basis. If a calculation cannot
be cancelled, you can be charged for its completion. If you are concerned about
being charged for a calculation that cannot be cancelled, consider terminating the
session in which the calculation is running.
