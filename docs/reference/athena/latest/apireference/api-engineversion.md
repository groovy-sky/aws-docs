# EngineVersion

The Athena engine version for running queries, or the PySpark engine
version for running sessions.

## Contents

**EffectiveEngineVersion**

Read only. The engine version on which the query runs. If the user requests a valid
engine version other than Auto, the effective engine version is the same as the engine
version that the user requested. If the user requests Auto, the effective engine version
is chosen by Athena. When a request to update the engine version is made by
a `CreateWorkGroup` or `UpdateWorkGroup` operation, the
`EffectiveEngineVersion` field is ignored.
