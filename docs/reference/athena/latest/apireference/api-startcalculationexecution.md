# StartCalculationExecution

Submits calculations for execution within a session. You can supply the code to run as
an inline code block within the request.

###### Note

The request syntax requires the [StartCalculationExecution:CodeBlock](#athena-StartCalculationExecution-request-CodeBlock) parameter or the [CalculationConfiguration:CodeBlock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_CalculationConfiguration.html#athena-Type-CalculationConfiguration-CodeBlock) parameter, but not both. Because
[CalculationConfiguration:CodeBlock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_CalculationConfiguration.html#athena-Type-CalculationConfiguration-CodeBlock) is deprecated, use the
[StartCalculationExecution:CodeBlock](#athena-StartCalculationExecution-request-CodeBlock) parameter
instead.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "CalculationConfiguration": {
      "CodeBlock": "string"
   },
   "ClientRequestToken": "string",
   "CodeBlock": "string",
   "Description": "string",
   "SessionId": "string"
}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[CalculationConfiguration](#API_StartCalculationExecution_RequestSyntax)**

_This parameter has been deprecated._

Contains configuration information for the calculation.

Type: [CalculationConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_CalculationConfiguration.html) object

Required: No

**[ClientRequestToken](#API_StartCalculationExecution_RequestSyntax)**

A unique case-sensitive string used to ensure the request to create the calculation is
idempotent (executes only once). If another
`StartCalculationExecutionRequest` is received, the same response is
returned and another calculation is not created. If a parameter has changed, an error is
returned.

###### Important

This token is listed as not required because AWS SDKs (for example
the AWS SDK for Java) auto-generate the token for users. If you are
not using the AWS SDK or the AWS CLI, you must provide
this token or the action will fail.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 32. Maximum length of 128.

Required: No

**[CodeBlock](#API_StartCalculationExecution_RequestSyntax)**

A string that contains the code of the calculation. Use this parameter instead of
[CalculationConfiguration:CodeBlock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_CalculationConfiguration.html#athena-Type-CalculationConfiguration-CodeBlock), which is deprecated.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 68000.

Required: No

**[Description](#API_StartCalculationExecution_RequestSyntax)**

A description of the calculation.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

Required: No

**[SessionId](#API_StartCalculationExecution_RequestSyntax)**

The session ID.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 256.

Required: Yes

## Response Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "CalculationExecutionId": "string",
   "State": "string"
}
```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[CalculationExecutionId](#API_StartCalculationExecution_ResponseSyntax)**

The calculation execution UUID.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 36.

**[State](#API_StartCalculationExecution_ResponseSyntax)**

`CREATING` \- The calculation is in the process of being created.

`CREATED` \- The calculation has been created and is ready to run.

`QUEUED` \- The calculation has been queued for processing.

`RUNNING` \- The calculation is running.

`CANCELING` \- A request to cancel the calculation has been received and the
system is working to stop it.

`CANCELED` \- The calculation is no longer running as the result of a cancel
request.

`COMPLETED` \- The calculation has completed without error.

`FAILED` \- The calculation failed and is no longer running.

Type: String

Valid Values: `CREATING | CREATED | QUEUED | RUNNING | CANCELING | CANCELED | COMPLETED | FAILED`

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html).

**InternalServerException**

Indicates a platform issue, which may be due to a transient condition or
outage.

HTTP Status Code: 500

**InvalidRequestException**

Indicates that something is wrong with the input to the request. For example, a
required parameter may be missing or out of range.

**AthenaErrorCode**

The error code returned when the query execution failed to process, or when the
processing request for the named query failed.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ResourceNotFoundException**

A resource, such as a workgroup, was not found.

**ResourceName**

The name of the Amazon resource.
