# GetQueryRuntimeStatistics

Returns query execution runtime statistics related to a single execution of a query if
you have access to the workgroup in which the query ran. Statistics from the
`Timeline` section of the response object are available as soon as [QueryExecutionStatus:State](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/API_QueryExecutionStatus.html#athena-Type-QueryExecutionStatus-State) is in a SUCCEEDED or FAILED state. The
remaining non-timeline statistics in the response (like stage-level input and output row
count and data size) are updated asynchronously and may not be available immediately
after a query completes or, in some cases, may not be returned. The non-timeline
statistics are also not included when a query has row-level filters defined in Lake Formation.
