# QueryExecutionStatistics
<a name="API_QueryExecutionStatistics"></a>

The amount of data scanned during the query execution and the amount of time that it took to execute, and the type of statement that was run.

## Contents
<a name="API_QueryExecutionStatistics_Contents"></a>

 ** DataManifestLocation **   <a name="athena-Type-QueryExecutionStatistics-DataManifestLocation"></a>
The location and file name of a data manifest file. The manifest file is saved to the Athena query results location in Amazon S3. The manifest file tracks files that the query wrote to Amazon S3. If the query fails, the manifest file also tracks files that the query intended to write. The manifest is useful for identifying orphaned files resulting from a failed query. For more information, see [Working with Query Results, Output Files, and Query History](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/querying.html) in the *Amazon Athena User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** DataScannedInBytes **   <a name="athena-Type-QueryExecutionStatistics-DataScannedInBytes"></a>
The number of bytes in the data that was queried.
Type: Long
Required: No

 ** DpuCount **   <a name="athena-Type-QueryExecutionStatistics-DpuCount"></a>
The number of Data Processing Units (DPUs) that Athena used to run the query.
Type: Double
Required: No

 ** EngineExecutionTimeInMillis **   <a name="athena-Type-QueryExecutionStatistics-EngineExecutionTimeInMillis"></a>
The number of milliseconds that the query took to execute.
Type: Long
Required: No

 ** QueryPlanningTimeInMillis **   <a name="athena-Type-QueryExecutionStatistics-QueryPlanningTimeInMillis"></a>
The number of milliseconds that Athena took to plan the query processing flow. This includes the time spent retrieving table partitions from the data source. Note that because the query engine performs the query planning, query planning time is a subset of engine processing time.
Type: Long
Required: No

 ** QueryQueueTimeInMillis **   <a name="athena-Type-QueryExecutionStatistics-QueryQueueTimeInMillis"></a>
The number of milliseconds that the query was in your query queue waiting for resources. Note that if transient errors occur, Athena might automatically add the query back to the queue.
Type: Long
Required: No

 ** ResultReuseInformation **   <a name="athena-Type-QueryExecutionStatistics-ResultReuseInformation"></a>
Contains information about whether previous query results were reused for the query.
Type: [ResultReuseInformation](API_ResultReuseInformation.md) object
Required: No

 ** ServicePreProcessingTimeInMillis **   <a name="athena-Type-QueryExecutionStatistics-ServicePreProcessingTimeInMillis"></a>
The number of milliseconds that Athena took to preprocess the query before submitting the query to the query engine.
Type: Long
Required: No

 ** ServiceProcessingTimeInMillis **   <a name="athena-Type-QueryExecutionStatistics-ServiceProcessingTimeInMillis"></a>
The number of milliseconds that Athena took to finalize and publish the query results after the query engine finished running the query.
Type: Long
Required: No

 ** TotalExecutionTimeInMillis **   <a name="athena-Type-QueryExecutionStatistics-TotalExecutionTimeInMillis"></a>
The number of milliseconds that Athena took to run the query.
Type: Long
Required: No
