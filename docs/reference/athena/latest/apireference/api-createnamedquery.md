# CreateNamedQuery

Creates a named query in the specified workgroup. Requires that you have access to the
workgroup.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "ClientRequestToken": "string",
   "Database": "string",
   "Description": "string",
   "Name": "string",
   "QueryString": "string",
   "WorkGroup": "string"
}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[ClientRequestToken](#API_CreateNamedQuery_RequestSyntax)**

A unique case-sensitive string used to ensure the request to create the query is
idempotent (executes only once). If another `CreateNamedQuery` request is
received, the same response is returned and another query is not created. If a parameter
has changed, for example, the `QueryString`, an error is returned.

###### Important

This token is listed as not required because AWS SDKs (for example
the AWS SDK for Java) auto-generate the token for users. If you are
not using the AWS SDK or the AWS CLI, you must provide
this token or the action will fail.
