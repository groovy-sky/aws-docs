# TagResource

Adds one or more tags to an Athena resource. A tag is a label that you
assign to a resource. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which
you define. For example, you can use tags to categorize Athena workgroups,
data catalogs, or capacity reservations by purpose, owner, or environment. Use a
consistent set of tag keys to make it easier to search and filter the resources in your
account. For best practices, see [Tagging\
Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html). Tag keys can be from 1 to 128 UTF-8 Unicode characters, and
tag values can be from 0 to 256 UTF-8 Unicode characters. Tags can use letters and
numbers representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . \_ : / @. Tag keys
and values are case-sensitive. Tag keys must be unique per resource. If you specify more
than one tag, separate them by commas.
