# TerminateSession

Terminates an active session. A `TerminateSession` call on a session that
is already inactive (for example, in a `FAILED`, `TERMINATED` or
`TERMINATING` state) succeeds but has no effect. Calculations running in
the session when `TerminateSession` is called are forcefully stopped, but may
display as `FAILED` instead of `STOPPED`.
