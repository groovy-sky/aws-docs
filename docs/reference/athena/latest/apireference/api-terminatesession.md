# TerminateSession
<a name="API_TerminateSession"></a>

Terminates an active session. A `TerminateSession` call on a session that is already inactive (for example, in a `FAILED`, `TERMINATED` or `TERMINATING` state) succeeds but has no effect. Calculations running in the session when `TerminateSession` is called are forcefully stopped, but may display as `FAILED` instead of `STOPPED`.
