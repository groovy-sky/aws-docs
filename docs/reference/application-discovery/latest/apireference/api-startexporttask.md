# StartExportTask

###### Important

AWS Application Discovery Service is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS Application Discovery Service availability change](../../../../services/application-discovery/latest/userguide/application-discovery-service-availability-change.md).

Begins the export of a discovered data report to an Amazon S3 bucket managed by AWS.

###### Note

Exports might provide an estimate of fees and savings based on certain information that
you provide. Fee estimates do not include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees and
savings depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services, which
might vary from the estimates provided in this report.

If you do not specify `preferences` or `agentIds` in the filter, a
summary of all servers, applications, tags, and performance is generated. This data is an
aggregation of all server data collected through on-premises tooling, file import, application
grouping and applying tags.

If you specify `agentIds` in a filter, the task exports up to 72 hours of
detailed data collected by the identified Application Discovery Agent, including network,
process, and performance details. A time range for exported agent data may be set by using
`startTime` and `endTime`. Export of detailed agent data is limited to
five concurrently running exports. Export of detailed agent data is limited to two exports per
day.

If you enable `ec2RecommendationsPreferences` in `preferences` [ExportPreferences](api-exportpreferences.md), an Amazon EC2 instance matching the characteristics
of each server in Application Discovery Service is generated. Changing the attributes of the
`ec2RecommendationsPreferences` changes the criteria of the
recommendation.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "endTime": number,
   "exportDataFormat": [ "string" ],
   "filters": [
      {
         "condition": "string",
         "name": "string",
         "values": [ "string" ]
      }
   ],
   "preferences": { ... },
   "startTime": number
}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[endTime](#API_StartExportTask_RequestSyntax)**

The end timestamp for exported data from the single Application Discovery Agent
selected in the filters. If no value is specified, exported data includes the most recent data
collected by the agent.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**[exportDataFormat](#API_StartExportTask_RequestSyntax)**

The file format for the returned export data. Default value is `CSV`.
**Note:** _The_ `GRAPHML` _option has been deprecated._

Type: Array of strings

Valid Values: `CSV`

Required: No

**[filters](#API_StartExportTask_RequestSyntax)**

If a filter is present, it selects the single `agentId` of the Application
Discovery Agent for which data is exported. The `agentId` can be found in the
results of the `DescribeAgents` API or CLI. If no filter is present,
`startTime` and `endTime` are ignored and exported data includes both
AWS Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector collectors data and summary data from Application Discovery
Agent agents.

Type: Array of [ExportFilter](api-exportfilter.md) objects

Required: No

**[preferences](#API_StartExportTask_RequestSyntax)**

Indicates the type of data that needs to be exported. Only one [ExportPreferences](api-exportpreferences.md) can be enabled at any time.

Type: [ExportPreferences](api-exportpreferences.md) object

**Note:** This object is a Union. Only one member of this object can be specified or returned.

Required: No

**[startTime](#API_StartExportTask_RequestSyntax)**

The start timestamp for exported data from the single Application Discovery Agent
selected in the filters. If no value is specified, data is exported starting from the first
data collected by the agent.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

## Response Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "exportId": "string"
}
```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[exportId](#API_StartExportTask_ResponseSyntax)**

A unique identifier used to query the status of an export request.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 200.

Pattern: `\S*`

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**AuthorizationErrorException**

The user does not have permission to perform the action. Check the IAM policy
associated with this user.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**HomeRegionNotSetException**

## Examples

In the following example or examples, the Authorization header contents
( `AUTHPARAMS`) must be replaced with an AWS Signature Version 4 signature.
For more information about creating these signatures, see [Signature Version 4\
Signing Process](../../../../general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.md) in the _AWS General Reference_.

You only need to learn how to sign HTTP requests if you intend to manually create
them. When you use the [AWS Command Line Interface\
(AWS CLI)](http://aws.amazon.com/cli) or one of the [AWS SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools)
to make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the requests for you with the
access key that you specify when you configure the tools. When you use these tools, you
don't need to learn how to sign requests yourself.
