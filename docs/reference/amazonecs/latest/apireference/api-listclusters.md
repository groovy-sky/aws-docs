# ListClusters

Returns a list of existing clusters.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "maxResults": number,
   "nextToken": "string"
}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[maxResults](#API_ListClusters_RequestSyntax)**

The maximum number of cluster results that `ListClusters` returned in
paginated output. When this parameter is used, `ListClusters` only returns
`maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken`
response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending
another `ListClusters` request with the returned `nextToken`
value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then
`ListClusters` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken`
value if applicable.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**[nextToken](#API_ListClusters_RequestSyntax)**

The `nextToken` value returned from a `ListClusters` request
indicating that more results are available to fulfill the request and further calls are
needed. If `maxResults` was provided, it's possible the number of results to
be fewer than `maxResults`.

###### Note

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve
the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.

Type: String

Required: No

## Response Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "clusterArns": [ "string" ],
   "nextToken": "string"
}
```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[clusterArns](#API_ListClusters_ResponseSyntax)**

The list of full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) entries for each cluster that's associated
with your account.

Type: Array of strings

**[nextToken](#API_ListClusters_ResponseSyntax)**

The `nextToken` value to include in a future `ListClusters`
request. When the results of a `ListClusters` request exceed
`maxResults`, this value can be used to retrieve the next page of
results. This value is `null` when there are no more results to
return.

Type: String

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**ClientException**

These errors are usually caused by a client action. This client action might be using
an action or resource on behalf of a user that doesn't have permissions to use the
action or resource. Or, it might be specifying an identifier that isn't valid.

**message**

Message that describes the cause of the exception.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InvalidParameterException**

The specified parameter isn't valid. Review the available parameters for the API
request.

For more information about service event errors, see [Amazon ECS\
service event messages](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-event-messages-list.md).

**message**

Message that describes the cause of the exception.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ServerException**

These errors are usually caused by a server issue.

**message**

Message that describes the cause of the exception.

HTTP Status Code: 500

## Examples

In the following example or examples, the Authorization header contents
( `AUTHPARAMS`) must be replaced with an AWS Signature
Version 4 signature. For more information, see [Signature\
Version 4 Signing Process](../../../../general/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.md) in the _AWS_
_General Reference_.

You only need to learn how to sign HTTP requests if you intend to create them
manually. When you use the [AWS Command Line Interface](http://aws.amazon.com/cli) or one of the [AWS SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools) to make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the requests for you, with the
access key that you specify when you configure the tools. When you use these tools,
you don't have to sign requests yourself.

### Example

This example request lists the clusters for your account.
