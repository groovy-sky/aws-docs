# CreateService

Runs and maintains your desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If
the number of tasks running in a service drops below the `desiredCount`,
Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing
service, use [UpdateService](api-updateservice.md).

###### Note

On March 21, 2024, a change was made to resolve the task definition revision
before authorization. When a task definition revision is not specified,
authorization will occur using the latest revision of a task definition.

###### Note

Amazon Elastic Inference (EI) is no longer available to customers.

In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can
optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers. The load balancers
distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more
information, see [Service load balancing](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.md) in the _Amazon Elastic_
_Container Service Developer Guide_.

You can attach Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon ECS tasks by configuring the volume when
creating or updating a service. `volumeConfigurations` is only supported for
REPLICA service and not DAEMON service. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volumes](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ebs-volumes-ebs-volume-types.md) in the _Amazon Elastic_
_Container Service Developer Guide_.

Tasks for services that don't use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in
the `RUNNING` state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are
considered healthy if they're in the `RUNNING` state and are reported as
healthy by the load balancer.

There are two service scheduler strategies available:

- `REPLICA` \- The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains
your desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service
scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement
strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more
information, see [Service scheduler concepts](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ecs-services.md) in the
_Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer_
_Guide_.

- `DAEMON` \- The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task
on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement
constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also
evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks. It also stops tasks
that don't meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, you don't
need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use
Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see [Amazon ECS services](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ecs-services.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Container_
_Service Developer Guide_.

The deployment controller is the mechanism that determines how tasks are deployed for
your service. The valid options are:

- ECS

When you create a service which uses the `ECS` deployment
controller, you can choose between the following deployment strategies (which
you can set in the “ `strategy`” field in
“ `deploymentConfiguration`”): :

- `ROLLING`: When you create a service which uses the
_rolling update_ ( `ROLLING`)
deployment strategy, the Amazon ECS service scheduler replaces the
currently running tasks with new tasks. The number of tasks that Amazon
ECS adds or removes from the service during a rolling update is
controlled by the service deployment configuration. For more
information, see [Deploy Amazon ECS services by replacing\
tasks](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-ecs.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service_
_Developer Guide_.

Rolling update deployments are best suited for the following
scenarios:

- Gradual service updates: You need to update your service
incrementally without taking the entire service offline at
once.

- Limited resource requirements: You want to avoid the
additional resource costs of running two complete environments
simultaneously (as required by blue/green deployments).

- Acceptable deployment time: Your application can tolerate a
longer deployment process, as rolling updates replace tasks one
by one.

- No need for instant roll back: Your service can tolerate a
rollback process that takes minutes rather than seconds.

- Simple deployment process: You prefer a straightforward
deployment approach without the complexity of managing multiple
environments, target groups, and listeners.

- No load balancer requirement: Your service doesn't use or
require a load balancer, Application Load Balancer, Network Load
Balancer, or Service Connect (which are required for blue/green
deployments).

- Stateful applications: Your application maintains state that
makes it difficult to run two parallel environments.

- Cost sensitivity: You want to minimize deployment costs by not
running duplicate environments during deployment.

Rolling updates are the default deployment strategy for services and
provide a balance between deployment safety and resource efficiency for
many common application scenarios.

- `BLUE_GREEN`: A _blue/green_ deployment
strategy ( `BLUE_GREEN`) is a release methodology that reduces
downtime and risk by running two identical production environments
called blue and green. With Amazon ECS blue/green deployments, you can
validate new service revisions before directing production traffic to
them. This approach provides a safer way to deploy changes with the
ability to quickly roll back if needed. For more information, see [Amazon ECS blue/green deployments](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-blue-green.md) in
the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer_
_Guide_.

Amazon ECS blue/green deployments are best suited for the following
scenarios:

- Service validation: When you need to validate new service
revisions before directing production traffic to them

- Zero downtime: When your service requires zero-downtime
deployments

- Instant roll back: When you need the ability to quickly roll
back if issues are detected

- Load balancer requirement: When your service uses Application
Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or Service Connect

- `LINEAR`: A _linear_ deployment strategy
( `LINEAR`) gradually shifts traffic from the current
production environment to a new environment in equal percentage
increments. With Amazon ECS linear deployments, you can control the pace
of traffic shifting and validate new service revisions with increasing
amounts of production traffic.

Linear deployments are best suited for the following scenarios:

- Gradual validation: When you want to gradually validate your
new service version with increasing traffic

- Performance monitoring: When you need time to monitor metrics
and performance during the deployment

- Risk minimization: When you want to minimize risk by exposing
the new version to production traffic incrementally

- Load balancer requirement: When your service uses Application
Load Balancer or Service Connect

- `CANARY`: A _canary_ deployment strategy
( `CANARY`) shifts a small percentage of traffic to the
new service revision first, then shifts the remaining traffic all at
once after a specified time period. This allows you to test the new
version with a subset of users before full deployment.

Canary deployments are best suited for the following scenarios:

- Feature testing: When you want to test new features with a
small subset of users before full rollout

- Production validation: When you need to validate performance
and functionality with real production traffic

- Blast radius control: When you want to minimize blast radius
if issues are discovered in the new version

- Load balancer requirement: When your service uses Application
Load Balancer or Service Connect

- External

Use a third-party deployment controller.

- Blue/green deployment (powered by AWS CodeDeploy)

AWS CodeDeploy installs an updated version of the application as a new
replacement task set and reroutes production traffic from the original
application task set to the replacement task set. The original task set is
terminated after a successful deployment. Use this deployment controller to
verify a new deployment of a service before sending production traffic to
it.

When creating a service that uses the `EXTERNAL` deployment controller, you
can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at the task set level. The only
required parameter is the service name. You control your services using the [CreateTaskSet](api-createtaskset.md). For more information, see [Amazon ECS deployment types](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Container_
_Service Developer Guide_.

When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement. For
information about task placement and task placement strategies, see [Amazon ECS task placement](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/task-placement.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service_
_Developer Guide_

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[availabilityZoneRebalancing](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

Indicates whether to use Availability Zone rebalancing for the service.

For more information, see [Balancing an Amazon\
ECS service across Availability Zones](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-rebalancing.md) in the _Amazon_
_Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

The default behavior of `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` differs between
create and update requests:

- For create service requests, when no value is specified for
`AvailabilityZoneRebalancing`, Amazon ECS defaults the value to
`ENABLED`.

- For update service requests, when no value is specified for
`AvailabilityZoneRebalancing`, Amazon ECS defaults to the
existing service’s `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` value. If the
service never had an `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` value set, Amazon
ECS treats this as `DISABLED`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `ENABLED | DISABLED`

Required: No

**[capacityProviderStrategy](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The capacity provider strategy to use for the service.

###### Note

If you want to use Amazon ECS Managed Instances, you must use the
`capacityProviderStrategy` request parameter and omit the
`launchType` request parameter.

If a `capacityProviderStrategy` is specified, the `launchType`
parameter must be omitted. If no `capacityProviderStrategy` or
`launchType` is specified, the
`defaultCapacityProviderStrategy` for the cluster is used.

A capacity provider strategy can contain a maximum of 20 capacity providers.

Type: Array of [CapacityProviderStrategyItem](api-capacityproviderstrategyitem.md) objects

Required: No

**[clientToken](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

An identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. It must be
unique and is case sensitive. Up to 36 ASCII characters in the range of 33-126
(inclusive) are allowed.

Type: String

Required: No

**[cluster](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that you run your
service on. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

Type: String

Required: No

**[deploymentConfiguration](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during the deployment
and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.

Type: [DeploymentConfiguration](api-deploymentconfiguration.md) object

Required: No

**[deploymentController](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The deployment controller to use for the service. If no deployment controller is
specified, the default value of `ECS` is used.

Type: [DeploymentController](api-deploymentcontroller.md) object

Required: No

**[desiredCount](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The number of instantiations of the specified task definition to place and keep
running in your service.

This is required if `schedulingStrategy` is `REPLICA` or isn't
specified. If `schedulingStrategy` is `DAEMON` then this isn't
required.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**[enableECSManagedTags](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies whether to turn on Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks within the service.
For more information, see [Tagging your Amazon ECS\
resources](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ecs-using-tags.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer_
_Guide_.

When you use Amazon ECS managed tags, you must set the `propagateTags`
request parameter.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[enableExecuteCommand](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

Determines whether the execute command functionality is turned on for the service. If
`true`, this enables execute command functionality on all containers in
the service tasks.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores
unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing, VPC Lattice, and container health checks after a task
has first started. If you do not specify a health check grace period value, the default
value of 0 is used. If you do not use any of the health checks, then
`healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds` is unused.

If your service has more running tasks than desired, unhealthy tasks in the grace
period might be stopped to reach the desired count.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**[launchType](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The infrastructure that you run your service on. For more information, see [Amazon\
ECS launch types](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/launch-types.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer_
_Guide_.

###### Note

If you want to use Amazon ECS Managed Instances, you must use the
`capacityProviderStrategy` request parameter and omit the
`launchType` request parameter.

The `FARGATE` launch type runs your tasks on AWS Fargate On-Demand
infrastructure.

###### Note

Fargate Spot infrastructure is available for use but a capacity provider strategy
must be used. For more information, see [AWS Fargate capacity providers](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/fargate-capacity-providers.md) in
the _Amazon ECS Developer Guide_.

The `EC2` launch type runs your tasks on Amazon EC2 instances registered to
your cluster.

The `EXTERNAL` launch type runs your tasks on your on-premises server or
virtual machine (VM) capacity registered to your cluster.

A service can use either a launch type or a capacity provider strategy. If a
`launchType` is specified, the `capacityProviderStrategy`
parameter must be omitted.

Type: String

Valid Values: `EC2 | FARGATE | EXTERNAL | MANAGED_INSTANCES`

Required: No

**[loadBalancers](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

A load balancer object representing the load balancers to use with your service. For
more information, see [Service load balancing](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.md) in the _Amazon Elastic_
_Container Service Developer Guide_.

If the service uses the `ECS` deployment controller and using either an
Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer, you must specify one or more target
group ARNs to attach to the service. The service-linked role is required for services
that use multiple target groups. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.md) in the
_Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

If the service uses the `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controller, the service is
required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. When
creating an AWS CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two target groups (referred to as
a `targetGroupPair`). During a deployment, AWS CodeDeploy determines which
task set in your service has the status `PRIMARY`, and it associates one
target group with it. Then, it also associates the other target group with the
replacement task set. The load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required
listener for production traffic and an optional listener that you can use to perform
validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production traffic to it.

If you use the `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controller, these values can be
changed when updating the service.

For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object must contain
the load balancer target group ARN, the container name, and the container port to access
from the load balancer. The container name must be as it appears in a container
definition. The load balancer name parameter must be omitted. When a task from this
service is placed on a container instance, the container instance and port combination
is registered as a target in the target group that's specified here.

For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer name, the
container name , and the container port to access from the load balancer. The container
name must be as it appears in a container definition. The target group ARN parameter
must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the
container instance is registered with the load balancer that's specified here.

Services with tasks that use the `awsvpc` network mode (for example, those
with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load Balancers and Network Load
Balancers. Classic Load Balancers aren't supported. Also, when you create any target
groups for these services, you must choose `ip` as the target type, not
`instance`. This is because tasks that use the `awsvpc`
network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2
instance.

Type: Array of [LoadBalancer](api-loadbalancer.md) objects

Required: No

**[networkConfiguration](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for task
definitions that use the `awsvpc` network mode to receive their own elastic
network interface, and it isn't supported for other network modes. For more information,
see [Task networking](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/task-networking.md)
in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

Type: [NetworkConfiguration](api-networkconfiguration.md) object

Required: No

**[placementConstraints](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

An array of placement constraint objects to use for tasks in your service. You can
specify a maximum of 10 constraints for each task. This limit includes constraints in
the task definition and those specified at runtime.

Type: Array of [PlacementConstraint](api-placementconstraint.md) objects

Required: No

**[placementStrategy](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The placement strategy objects to use for tasks in your service. You can specify a
maximum of 5 strategy rules for each service.

Type: Array of [PlacementStrategy](api-placementstrategy.md) objects

Required: No

**[platformVersion](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The platform version that your tasks in the service are running on. A platform version
is specified only for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If one isn't specified, the
`LATEST` platform version is used. For more information, see [AWS Fargate platform versions](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/platform-versions.md) in the _Amazon Elastic_
_Container Service Developer Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**[propagateTags](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition to the task. If no
value is specified, the tags aren't propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the task
during task creation. To add tags to a task after task creation, use the [TagResource](api-tagresource.md) API action.

You must set this to a value other than `NONE` when you use Cost Explorer.
For more information, see [Amazon ECS usage\
reports](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/usage-reports.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer_
_Guide_.

The default is `NONE`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `TASK_DEFINITION | SERVICE | NONE`

Required: No

**[role](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Amazon ECS to
make calls to your load balancer on your behalf. This parameter is only permitted if you
are using a load balancer with your service and your task definition doesn't use the
`awsvpc` network mode. If you specify the `role` parameter,
you must also specify a load balancer object with the `loadBalancers`
parameter.

###### Important

If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that role
is used for your service unless you specify a role here. The service-linked role is
required if your task definition uses the `awsvpc` network mode or if the
service is configured to use service discovery, an external deployment controller,
multiple target groups, or Elastic Inference accelerators in which case you don't
specify a role here. For more information, see [Using\
service-linked roles for Amazon ECS](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.md) in the _Amazon Elastic_
_Container Service Developer Guide_.

If your specified role has a path other than `/`, then you must either
specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path.
For example, if a role with the name `bar` has a path of `/foo/`
then you would specify `/foo/bar` as the role name. For more information, see
[Friendly names and paths](../../../../services/iam/latest/userguide/reference-identifiers-identifiers-friendly-names.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**[schedulingStrategy](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more information, see [Services](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ecs-services.md).

There are two service scheduler strategies available:

- `REPLICA`-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the
desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler
spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies
and constraints to customize task placement decisions. This scheduler strategy
is required if the service uses the `CODE_DEPLOY` or
`EXTERNAL` deployment controller types.

- `DAEMON`-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on
each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints
that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task
placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that don't meet the
placement constraints. When you're using this strategy, you don't need to
specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service
Auto Scaling policies.

###### Note

Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the `CODE_DEPLOY` or
`EXTERNAL` deployment controller types don't support the
`DAEMON` scheduling strategy.

Type: String

Valid Values: `REPLICA | DAEMON`

Required: No

**[serviceConnectConfiguration](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The configuration for this service to discover and connect to services, and be
discovered by, and connected from, other services within a namespace.

Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the
namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace.
Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for
increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with
Service Connect. For more information, see [Service Connect](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-connect.md)
in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

Type: [ServiceConnectConfiguration](api-serviceconnectconfiguration.md) object

Required: No

**[serviceName](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers,
underscores, and hyphens are allowed. Service names must be unique within a cluster, but
you can have similarly named services in multiple clusters within a Region or across
multiple Regions.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**[serviceRegistries](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The details of the service discovery registry to associate with this service. For more
information, see [Service\
discovery](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.md).

###### Note

Each service may be associated with one service registry. Multiple service
registries for each service isn't supported.

Type: Array of [ServiceRegistry](api-serviceregistry.md) objects

Required: No

**[tags](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The metadata that you apply to the service to help you categorize and organize them.
Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. When a
service is deleted, the tags are deleted as well.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

- Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

- For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only
one value.

- Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

- Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

- If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources,
remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters.
Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in
UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . \_ : / @.

- Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

- Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase
combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for
AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with
this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource
limit.

Type: Array of [Tag](api-tag.md) objects

Array Members: Minimum number of 0 items. Maximum number of 50 items.

Required: No

**[taskDefinition](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The `family` and `revision` ( `family:revision`) or
full ARN of the task definition to run in your service. If a `revision` isn't
specified, the latest `ACTIVE` revision is used.

A task definition must be specified if the service uses either the `ECS` or
`CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controllers.

For more information about deployment types, see [Amazon ECS deployment\
types](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.md).

Type: String

Required: No

**[volumeConfigurations](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The configuration for a volume specified in the task definition as a volume that is
configured at launch time. Currently, the only supported volume type is an Amazon EBS
volume.

Type: Array of [ServiceVolumeConfiguration](api-servicevolumeconfiguration.md) objects

Required: No

**[vpcLatticeConfigurations](#API_CreateService_RequestSyntax)**

The VPC Lattice configuration for the service being created.

Type: Array of [VpcLatticeConfiguration](api-vpclatticeconfiguration.md) objects

Required: No

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[service](#API_CreateService_ResponseSyntax)**

The full description of your service following the create call.

A service will return either a `capacityProviderStrategy` or
`launchType` parameter, but not both, depending where one was specified
when it was created.

If a service is using the `ECS` deployment controller, the
`deploymentController` and `taskSets` parameters will not be
returned.

if the service uses the `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controller, the
`deploymentController`, `taskSets` and
`deployments` parameters will be returned, however the
`deployments` parameter will be an empty list.

Type: [Service](api-service.md) object

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**AccessDeniedException**

You don't have authorization to perform the requested action.

**message**

Message that describes the cause of the exception.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ClientException**

These errors are usually caused by a client action. This client action might be using
an action or resource on behalf of a user that doesn't have permissions to use the
action or resource. Or, it might be specifying an identifier that isn't valid.

**message**

Message that describes the cause of the exception.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ClusterNotFoundException**

The specified cluster wasn't found. You can view your available clusters with [ListClusters](api-listclusters.md). Amazon ECS clusters are Region specific.

**message**

Message that describes the cause of the exception.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InvalidParameterException**

The specified parameter isn't valid. Review the available parameters for the API

## Examples

In the following example or examples, the Authorization header contents
( `AUTHPARAMS`) must be replaced with an AWS Signature
Version 4 signature. For more information, see [Signature\
Version 4 Signing Process](../../../../general/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.md) in the _AWS_
_General Reference_.

You only need to learn how to sign HTTP requests if you intend to create them
manually. When you use the [AWS Command Line Interface](http://aws.amazon.com/cli) or one of the [AWS SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools) to make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the requests for you, with the
access key that you specify when you configure the tools. When you use these tools,
you don't have to sign requests yourself.

### Example 1

This example API request creates a service in your default Region called
`ecs-simple-service`. The service uses the `ecs-demo`
task definition and it maintains 10 instantiations of that task. It uses both
the `FARGATE` and `FARGATE_SPOT` capacity
providers.
