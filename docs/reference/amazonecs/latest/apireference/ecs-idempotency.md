# Ensuring idempotency

When you perform a mutating operation, you might see an exception because of timeouts or
server issues occurring after the resources are mutated. This can make it difficult to
determine whether the mutation occurred, and could lead to multiple retries. However, if the
original operation and the subsequent retries actually performed the mutations you might
have applied stacking changes or created more resources than you intended to. Idempotency
ensures that an operation mutates resources no more than one time. With an idempotent
request, if the original request mutated successfully, any subsequent retries complete
successfully without performing any further mutation.

## Idempotency in Amazon ECS

The following API actions optionally support idempotency using a _client_
_token_. The corresponding AWS CLI commands also support idempotency using a
client token. A client token is a unique, case-sensitive string. To make an idempotent
API request using one of these actions, specify a client token in the request. You
should not reuse the same client token for other API requests. If you retry a request
that completed successfully using the same client token and the same parameters, the
retry succeeds without performing any further actions.

###### Idempotent using a client token

- CreateService

The client token can be up to 36 ASCII characters in the range of 33-126
(inclusive).

- CreateTaskSet

The client token can be up to 36 ASCII characters in the range of 33-126
(inclusive).

- RunTask

The client token can be up to 64 ASCII characters in the range of 33-126
(inclusive).

###### Types of idempotency

- cluster – Requests with the same token in the same cluster are
idempotent. For example, ClientToken A can only be used as a request parameter
one time for `RunTask` requests in Cluster X. `RunTask`
requests to other clusters are considered a separate request. Therefore, you can
use ClientToken A for a `RunTask` request for cluster Y.

## Idempotency for RunTask

The `RunTask` API supports idempotency using a client token. A client token is
a unique string that you specify when you make an API request. If you retry an API
request with the same client token and the same request parameters after it has
completed successfully, the result of the original request is returned. If you retry a
successful request using the same client token, but one or more of the parameters are
different, other than the Region or Availability Zone, the retry fails with a
`ConflictException`. If you do not specify your own client token, the
AWS SDK and AWS Command Line Interface automatically generate a client token for the request to ensure
that it is idempotent. A client token can be any string that includes up to 64 ASCII
characters in the range of 33-126 (inclusive).

The time to live (TTL) for the `RunTask` client token is 24 hours. You
should not reuse the same client token for different requests. The client token maximum
TTL is valid for whichever of the following two values is lower:

- 24 hours

- The lifetime of the resource plus one hour

The lifetime of a resource is the timestamp at which the task was created to
the timestamp at which the last status ( `lastStatus`) transitioned to
`STOPPED`. When you use `RunTask` to launch more than
one task, the lifetime of the resource equals the lifetime of the last task that
transitioned to `STOPPED`.

### RunTask retry rules and responses

When you retry a request because you received a 5xx exception, the retried
successful response normally includes all of the information that the original
request would have returned. Tasks that have been stopped for under an hour only
include the task ARN, last status, and desired status.

The following is an example snippet of the response from a retry when there is one
running task, one stopped task, and one task that failed to launch.

```

{
  "failures": [
    {
      "arn": "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:container/4df26bb4-f057-467b-a079-961675296e64",
      "reason": "RESOURCE:MEMORY"
    }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "desiredStatus": "RUNNING",
      "taskArn": "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:task/default/fdf2c302-468c-4e55-b884-5331d816e7fb",
      ...
    },
    {
      "taskArn": "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:task/default/fdf2c302-468c-4e55-b884-5331d819999",
      "lastStatus": "STOPPED",
      ...
     }
  ]
}
```

Failures that are over an hour old only include the number of failed tasks.

## Retry recommendations for idempotent requests

The following table shows some common responses that you might get for idempotent API requests,
and provides retry recommendations.

ResponseRecommendationComments

200 (OK)

Do not retry

The original request completed successfully. Any subsequent retries return
successfully.

400-series response codes
( [client errors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/errors-overview.html#CommonErrors))

Do not retry

There is a problem with the request, from among the following:

- It includes a parameter or parameter combination that is not valid.

- It uses an action or resource for which you do not
have permissions.

- It uses a resource that is in the process of changing
states.

If the request involves a resource that is in the process of
changing states, retrying the request could possibly
succeed.

500-series response codes
( [server errors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/errors-overview.html#api-error-codes-table-server))

Retry

The error is caused by an AWS server-side issue and is generally
transient. Repeat the request with an appropriate back-off
strategy.
