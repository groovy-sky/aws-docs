# UpdateService

Modifies the parameters of a service.

###### Note

On March 21, 2024, a change was made to resolve the task definition revision
before authorization. When a task definition revision is not specified,
authorization will occur using the latest revision of a task definition.

For services using the rolling update ( `ECS`) you can update the desired
count, deployment configuration, network configuration, load balancers, service
registries, enable ECS managed tags option, propagate tags option, task placement
constraints and strategies, and task definition. When you update any of these
parameters, Amazon ECS starts new tasks with the new configuration.

You can attach Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon ECS tasks by configuring the volume when
starting or running a task, or when creating or updating a service. For more
information, see [Amazon EBS volumes](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ebs-volumes.md#ebs-volume-types) in the _Amazon Elastic_
_Container Service Developer Guide_. You can update your volume
configurations and trigger a new deployment. `volumeConfigurations` is only
supported for REPLICA service and not DAEMON service. If you leave
`volumeConfigurations` `null`, it doesn't trigger a new deployment. For more information on volumes,
see [Amazon EBS volumes](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ebs-volumes.md#ebs-volume-types) in the _Amazon Elastic_
_Container Service Developer Guide_.

For services using the blue/green ( `CODE_DEPLOY`) deployment controller,
only the desired count, deployment configuration, health check grace period, task
placement constraints and strategies, enable ECS managed tags option, and propagate tags
can be updated using this API. If the network configuration, platform version, task
definition, or load balancer need to be updated, create a new AWS CodeDeploy deployment. For
more information, see [CreateDeployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeployment.html) in the _AWS CodeDeploy API_
_Reference_.

For services using an external deployment controller, you can update only the desired
count, task placement constraints and strategies, health check grace period, enable ECS
managed tags option, and propagate tags option, using this API. If the launch type, load
balancer, network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be
updated, create a new task set For more information, see [CreateTaskSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTaskSet.html).

You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a
service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new
`desiredCount` parameter.

You can attach Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon ECS tasks by configuring the volume when
starting or running a task, or when creating or updating a service. For more
information, see [Amazon EBS volumes](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ebs-volumes.md#ebs-volume-types) in the _Amazon Elastic_
_Container Service Developer Guide_.

If you have updated the container image of your application, you can create a new task
definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The service scheduler uses the
minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters (in the service's deployment
configuration) to determine the deployment strategy.

###### Note

If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task
definition for your service (for example, `my_image:latest`), you don't
need to create a new revision of your task definition. You can update the service
using the `forceNewDeployment` option. The new tasks launched by the
deployment pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they
start.

You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is
triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the
deployment configuration parameters, `minimumHealthyPercent` and
`maximumPercent`, to determine the deployment strategy.

- If `minimumHealthyPercent` is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore
`desiredCount` temporarily during a deployment. For example, if
`desiredCount` is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the
scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for
services that don't use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the
`RUNNING` state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are
considered healthy if they're in the `RUNNING` state and are reported
as healthy by the load balancer.

- The `maximumPercent` parameter represents an upper limit on the
number of running tasks during a deployment. You can use it to define the
deployment batch size. For example, if `desiredCount` is four tasks,
a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks
(provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).

When [UpdateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateService.html)
stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of `docker stop` is issued
to the containers running in the task. This results in a `SIGTERM` and a
30-second timeout. After this, `SIGKILL` is sent and the containers are
forcibly stopped. If the container handles the `SIGTERM` gracefully and exits
within 30 seconds from receiving it, no `SIGKILL` is sent.

When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your
cluster with the following logic.

- Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your
service's task definition. For example, they have the required CPU, memory,
ports, and container instance attributes.

- By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across
Availability Zones in this manner even though you can choose a different
placement strategy.

- Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running
tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance.
For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C
each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are
considered optimal for placement.

- Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal
Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container
instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this
service.

When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain balance across
the Availability Zones in your cluster using the following logic:

- Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks for this
service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A
has one running service task and zones B and C each have two, container
instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for termination.

- Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based
on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the largest number of
running tasks for this service.

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[availabilityZoneRebalancing](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

Indicates whether to use Availability Zone rebalancing for the service.

For more information, see [Balancing an Amazon\
ECS service across Availability Zones](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-rebalancing.md) in the _Amazon_
_Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

The default behavior of `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` differs between
create and update requests:

- For create service requests, when no value is specified for
`AvailabilityZoneRebalancing`, Amazon ECS defaults the value to
`ENABLED`.

- For update service requests, when no value is specified for
`AvailabilityZoneRebalancing`, Amazon ECS defaults to the
existing service’s `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` value. If the
service never had an `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` value set, Amazon
ECS treats this as `DISABLED`.

This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

Type: String

Valid Values: `ENABLED | DISABLED`

Required: No

**[capacityProviderStrategy](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

The details of a capacity provider strategy. You can set a capacity provider when you
create a cluster, run a task, or update a service.

###### Note

If you want to use Amazon ECS Managed Instances, you must use the
`capacityProviderStrategy` request parameter.

When you use Fargate, the capacity providers are `FARGATE` or
`FARGATE_SPOT`.

When you use Amazon EC2, the capacity providers are Auto Scaling groups.

You can change capacity providers for rolling deployments and blue/green
deployments.

The following list provides the valid transitions:

- Update the Fargate launch type to an Auto Scaling group capacity
provider.

- Update the Amazon EC2 launch type to a Fargate capacity provider.

- Update the Fargate capacity provider to an Auto Scaling group capacity
provider.

- Update the Amazon EC2 capacity provider to a Fargate capacity provider.

- Update the Auto Scaling group or Fargate capacity provider back to the launch
type.

Pass an empty list in the `capacityProviderStrategy`
parameter.

For information about AWS CDK considerations, see [AWS CDK considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/update-service-parameters.html).

This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

Type: Array of [CapacityProviderStrategyItem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CapacityProviderStrategyItem.html) objects

Required: No

**[cluster](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that your service
runs on. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

You can't change the cluster name.

Type: String

Required: No

**[deploymentConfiguration](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during the deployment
and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.

This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

Type: [DeploymentConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DeploymentConfiguration.html) object

Required: No

**[deploymentController](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

The deployment controller to use for the service.

Type: [DeploymentController](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DeploymentController.html) object

Required: No

**[desiredCount](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

The number of instantiations of the task to place and keep running in your
service.

This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**[enableECSManagedTags](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

Determines whether to turn on Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks in the service.
For more information, see [Tagging Your Amazon ECS\
Resources](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ecs-using-tags.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer_
_Guide_.

Only tasks launched after the update will reflect the update. To update the tags on
all tasks, set `forceNewDeployment` to `true`, so that Amazon ECS
starts new tasks with the updated tags.

This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[enableExecuteCommand](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

If `true`, this enables execute command functionality on all task
containers.

If you do not want to override the value that was set when the service was created,
you can set this to `null` when performing this action.

This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[forceNewDeployment](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

Determines whether to force a new deployment of the service. By default, deployments
aren't forced. You can use this option to start a new deployment with no service
definition changes. For example, you can update a service's tasks to use a newer Docker
image with the same image/tag combination ( `my_image:latest`) or to roll
Fargate tasks onto a newer platform version.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores
unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing, VPC Lattice, and container health checks after a task
has first started. If you don't specify a health check grace period value, the default
value of `0` is used. If you don't use any of the health checks, then
`healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds` is unused.

If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to health checks, you can
specify a health check grace period of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds (about 69 years).
During that time, the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores health check status. This
grace period can prevent the service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and
stopping them before they have time to come up.

If your service has more running tasks than desired, unhealthy tasks in the grace
period might be stopped to reach the desired count.

This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**[loadBalancers](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

###### Note

You must have a service-linked role when you update this property

A list of Elastic Load Balancing load balancer objects. It contains the load balancer
name, the container name, and the container port to access from the load balancer. The
container name is as it appears in a container definition.

When you add, update, or remove a load balancer configuration, Amazon ECS starts new
tasks with the updated Elastic Load Balancing configuration, and then stops the old
tasks when the new tasks are running.

For services that use rolling updates, you can add, update, or remove Elastic Load
Balancing target groups. You can update from a single target group to multiple target
groups and from multiple target groups to a single target group.

For services that use blue/green deployments, you can update Elastic Load Balancing
target groups by using `
                     CreateDeployment
                  ` through AWS CodeDeploy. Note that multiple target groups
are not supported for blue/green deployments. For more information see [Register\
multiple target groups with a service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/register-multiple-targetgroups.html) in the _Amazon Elastic_
_Container Service Developer Guide_.

For services that use the external deployment controller, you can add, update, or
remove load balancers by using [CreateTaskSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTaskSet.html).
Note that multiple target groups are not supported for external deployments. For more
information see [Register\
multiple target groups with a service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/register-multiple-targetgroups.html) in the _Amazon Elastic_
_Container Service Developer Guide_.

You can remove existing `loadBalancers` by passing an empty list.

This parameter triggers a new service deployment.

Type: Array of [LoadBalancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_LoadBalancer.html) objects

Required: No

**[networkConfiguration](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

An object representing the network configuration for the service.

This parameter triggers a new service deployment.

Type: [NetworkConfiguration](api-networkconfiguration.md) object

Required: No

**[placementConstraints](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

An array of task placement constraint objects to update the service to use. If no
value is specified, the existing placement constraints for the service will remain
unchanged. If this value is specified, it will override any existing placement
constraints defined for the service. To remove all existing placement constraints,
specify an empty array.

You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints for each task. This limit includes
constraints in the task definition and those specified at runtime.

This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

Type: Array of [PlacementConstraint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PlacementConstraint.html) objects

Required: No

**[placementStrategy](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

The task placement strategy objects to update the service to use. If no value is
specified, the existing placement strategy for the service will remain unchanged. If
this value is specified, it will override the existing placement strategy defined for
the service. To remove an existing placement strategy, specify an empty object.

You can specify a maximum of five strategy rules for each service.

This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

Type: Array of [PlacementStrategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PlacementStrategy.html) objects

Required: No

**[platformVersion](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

The platform version that your tasks in the service run on. A platform version is only
specified for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If a platform version is not
specified, the `LATEST` platform version is used. For more information, see
[AWS Fargate\
Platform Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service_
_Developer Guide_.

This parameter triggers a new service deployment.

Type: String

Required: No

**[propagateTags](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

Determines whether to propagate the tags from the task definition or the service to
the task. If no value is specified, the tags aren't propagated.

Only tasks launched after the update will reflect the update. To update the tags on
all tasks, set `forceNewDeployment` to `true`, so that Amazon ECS
starts new tasks with the updated tags.

This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.

Type: String

Valid Values: `TASK_DEFINITION | SERVICE | NONE`

Required: No

**[service](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the service to update.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**[serviceConnectConfiguration](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

The configuration for this service to discover and connect to services, and be
discovered by, and connected from, other services within a namespace.

Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the
namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace.
Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for
increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with
Service Connect. For more information, see [Service Connect](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-connect.md)
in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

This parameter triggers a new service deployment.

Type: [ServiceConnectConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ServiceConnectConfiguration.html) object

Required: No

**[serviceRegistries](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

###### Note

You must have a service-linked role when you update this property.

For more information about the role see the `CreateService` request
parameter [`role`](api-createservice.md#ECS-CreateService-request-role).

The details for the service discovery registries to assign to this service. For more
information, see [Service\
Discovery](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.md).

When you add, update, or remove the service registries configuration, Amazon ECS
starts new tasks with the updated service registries configuration, and then stops the
old tasks when the new tasks are running.

You can remove existing `serviceRegistries` by passing an empty
list.

This parameter triggers a new service deployment.

Type: Array of [ServiceRegistry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ServiceRegistry.html) objects

Required: No

**[taskDefinition](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

The `family` and `revision` ( `family:revision`) or
full ARN of the task definition to run in your service. If a `revision` is
not specified, the latest `ACTIVE` revision is used. If you modify the task
definition with `UpdateService`, Amazon ECS spawns a task with the new
version of the task definition and then stops an old task after the new version is
running.

This parameter triggers a new service deployment.

Type: String

Required: No

**[volumeConfigurations](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

The details of the volume that was `configuredAtLaunch`. You can configure
the size, volumeType, IOPS, throughput, snapshot and encryption in [ServiceManagedEBSVolumeConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ServiceManagedEBSVolumeConfiguration.html). The `name` of the volume
must match the `name` from the task definition. If set to null, no new
deployment is triggered. Otherwise, if this configuration differs from the existing one,
it triggers a new deployment.

This parameter triggers a new service deployment.

Type: Array of [ServiceVolumeConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ServiceVolumeConfiguration.html) objects

Required: No

**[vpcLatticeConfigurations](#API_UpdateService_RequestSyntax)**

An object representing the VPC Lattice configuration for the service being
updated.

This parameter triggers a new service deployment.

Type: Array of [VpcLatticeConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_VpcLatticeConfiguration.html) objects

Required: No

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[service](#API_UpdateService_ResponseSyntax)**

The full description of your service following the update call.

Type: [Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_Service.html) object

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html).

**AccessDeniedException**

## Examples

In the following example or examples, the Authorization header contents
( `AUTHPARAMS`) must be replaced with an AWS Signature
Version 4 signature. For more information, see [Signature\
Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) in the _AWS_
_General Reference_.

You only need to learn how to sign HTTP requests if you intend to create them
manually. When you use the [AWS Command Line Interface](http://aws.amazon.com/cli) or one of the [AWS SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools) to make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the requests for you, with the
access key that you specify when you configure the tools. When you use these tools,
you don't have to sign requests yourself.

### Example

This example request updates the `hello_world` service to a desired
count of 3.
