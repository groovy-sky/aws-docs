# ServiceConnectConfiguration

The Service Connect configuration of your Amazon ECS service. The configuration for
this service to discover and connect to services, and be discovered by, and connected
from, other services within a namespace.

Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the
namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace.
Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for
increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with
Service Connect. For more information, see [Service Connect](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-connect.md)
in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

## Contents

**enabled**

Specifies whether to use Service Connect with this service.

Type: Boolean

Required: Yes

**accessLogConfiguration**

The configuration for Service Connect access logging. Access logs capture detailed
information about requests made to your service, including request patterns, response
codes, and timing data. They can be useful for debugging connectivity issues, monitoring
service performance, and auditing service-to-service communication for security and
compliance purposes.

###### Note

To enable access logs, you must also specify a `logConfiguration` in the `serviceConnectConfiguration`.

Type: [ServiceConnectAccessLogConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ServiceConnectAccessLogConfiguration.html) object

Required: No

**logConfiguration**

The log configuration for the container. This parameter maps to `LogConfig`
in the docker container create command and the `--log-driver` option to
docker run.

By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses.
However, the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by
specifying a log driver configuration in the container definition.

Understand the following when specifying a log configuration for your
containers.

- Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the
Docker daemon. Additional log drivers may be available in future releases of the
Amazon ECS container agent.

For tasks on AWS Fargate, the supported log drivers are
`awslogs`, `splunk`, and
`awsfirelens`.

For tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the supported log drivers are
`awslogs`, `fluentd`, `gelf`,
`json-file`, `journald`, `syslog`,
`splunk`, and `awsfirelens`.

- This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on
your container instance.

- For tasks that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the Amazon ECS container
agent must register the available logging drivers with the
`ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS` environment variable before
containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For
more information, see [Amazon ECS container agent configuration](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.md) in the
_Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer_
_Guide_.

- For tasks that are on AWS Fargate, because you don't have access
to the underlying infrastructure your tasks are hosted on, any additional
software needed must be installed outside of the task. For example, the Fluentd
output aggregators or a remote host running Logstash to send Gelf logs
to.

Type: [LogConfiguration](api-logconfiguration.md) object

Required: No

**namespace**

The namespace name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Cloud Map namespace for use
with Service Connect. The namespace must be in the same AWS Region as the
Amazon ECS service and cluster. The type of namespace doesn't affect Service Connect.
For more information about AWS Cloud Map, see [Working with Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/working-with-services.html)
in the _AWS Cloud Map Developer Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**services**

The list of Service Connect service objects. These are names and aliases (also known
as endpoints) that are used by other Amazon ECS services to connect to this service.

This field is not required for a "client" Amazon ECS service that's a member of a
namespace only to connect to other services within the namespace. An example of this
would be a frontend application that accepts incoming requests from either a load
balancer that's attached to the service or by other means.

An object selects a port from the task definition, assigns a name for the AWS Cloud Map
service, and a list of aliases (endpoints) and ports for client applications to refer to
this service.

Type: Array of [ServiceConnectService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ServiceConnectService.html) objects

Required: No
