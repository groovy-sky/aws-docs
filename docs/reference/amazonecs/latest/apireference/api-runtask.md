# RunTask

Starts a new task using the specified task definition.

###### Note

On March 21, 2024, a change was made to resolve the task definition revision
before authorization. When a task definition revision is not specified,
authorization will occur using the latest revision of a task definition.

###### Note

Amazon Elastic Inference (EI) is no longer available to customers.

You can allow Amazon ECS to place tasks for you, or you can customize how Amazon ECS
places tasks using placement constraints and placement strategies. For more information,
see [Scheduling Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduling_tasks.html) in the _Amazon Elastic_
_Container Service Developer Guide_.

Alternatively, you can use `StartTask` to use your own scheduler or place
tasks manually on specific container instances.

You can attach Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon ECS tasks by configuring the volume when
creating or updating a service. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ebs-volumes.html#ebs-volume-types) in the _Amazon Elastic_
_Container Service Developer Guide_.

The Amazon ECS API follows an eventual consistency model. This is because of the
distributed nature of the system supporting the API. This means that the result of an
API command you run that affects your Amazon ECS resources might not be immediately
visible to all subsequent commands you run. Keep this in mind when you carry out an API
command that immediately follows a previous API command.

To manage eventual consistency, you can do the following:

- Confirm the state of the resource before you run a command to modify it. Run
the DescribeTasks command using an exponential backoff algorithm to ensure that
you allow enough time for the previous command to propagate through the system.
To do this, run the DescribeTasks command repeatedly, starting with a couple of
seconds of wait time and increasing gradually up to five minutes of wait
time.

- Add wait time between subsequent commands, even if the DescribeTasks command
returns an accurate response. Apply an exponential backoff algorithm starting
with a couple of seconds of wait time, and increase gradually up to about five
minutes of wait time.

If you get a `ConflictException` error, the `RunTask` request
could not be processed due to conflicts. The provided `clientToken` is
already in use with a different `RunTask` request. The
`resourceIds` are the existing task ARNs which are already associated
with the `clientToken`.

To fix this issue:

- Run `RunTask` with a unique `clientToken`.

- Run `RunTask` with the `clientToken` and the original
set of parameters

If you get a `ClientException` error, the `RunTask` could not be
processed because you use managed scaling and there is a capacity error because the
quota of tasks in the `PROVISIONING` per cluster has been reached. For
information about the service quotas, see [Amazon ECS service\
quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-quotas.html).

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[capacityProviderStrategy](#API_RunTask_RequestSyntax)**

The capacity provider strategy to use for the task.

###### Note

If you want to use Amazon ECS Managed Instances, you must use the
`capacityProviderStrategy` request parameter and omit the
`launchType` request parameter.

If a `capacityProviderStrategy` is specified, the `launchType`
parameter must be omitted. If no `capacityProviderStrategy` or
`launchType` is specified, the
`defaultCapacityProviderStrategy` for the cluster is used.

When you use cluster auto scaling, you must specify
`capacityProviderStrategy` and not `launchType`.

A capacity provider strategy can contain a maximum of 20 capacity providers.

unique and is case sensitive. Up to 64 characters are allowed. The valid characters are
characters in the range of 33-126, inclusive. For more information, see [Ensuring idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/ECS_Idempotency.html).

Type: String

Required: No

**[cluster](#API_RunTask_RequestSyntax)**

The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster to run your task on.
If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

Each account receives a default cluster the first time you use the service, but you
may also create other clusters.

_Guide_.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[enableExecuteCommand](#API_RunTask_RequestSyntax)**

Determines whether to use the execute command functionality for the containers in this
task. If `true`, this enables execute command functionality on all containers
in the task.

If `true`, then the task definition must have a task role, or you must
provide one as an override.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[group](#API_RunTask_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the task group to associate with the task. The default value is the family
name of the task definition (for example, `family:my-family-name`).

The infrastructure to run your standalone task on. For more information, see [Amazon\
ECS launch types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer_
_Guide_.

###### Note

If you want to use Amazon ECS Managed Instances, you must use the
`capacityProviderStrategy` request parameter and omit the
`launchType` request parameter.

The `FARGATE` launch type runs your tasks on AWS Fargate On-Demand
infrastructure.

###### Note

Fargate Spot infrastructure is available for use but a capacity provider strategy
must be used. For more information, see [AWS Fargate capacity providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/fargate-capacity-providers.html) in
the _Amazon ECS Developer Guide_.

The `EC2` launch type runs your tasks on Amazon EC2 instances registered to
your cluster.

The `EXTERNAL` launch type runs your tasks on your on-premises server or
virtual machine (VM) capacity registered to your cluster.

A task can use either a launch type or a capacity provider strategy. If a
`launchType` is specified, the `capacityProviderStrategy`
parameter must be omitted.

When you use cluster auto scaling, you must specify
`capacityProviderStrategy` and not `launchType`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `EC2 | FARGATE | EXTERNAL | MANAGED_INSTANCES`

Required: No

**[networkConfiguration](#API_RunTask_RequestSyntax)**

The network configuration for the task. This parameter is required for task
definitions that use the `awsvpc` network mode to receive their own elastic
network interface, and it isn't supported for other network modes. For more information,
see [Task networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html)

Required: No

**[overrides](#API_RunTask_RequestSyntax)**

A list of container overrides in JSON format that specify the name of a container in
the specified task definition and the overrides it should receive. You can override the
default command for a container (that's specified in the task definition or Docker
image) with a `command` override. You can also override existing environment
variables (that are specified in the task definition or Docker image) on a container or
add new environment variables to it with an `environment` override.

A total of 8192 characters are allowed for overrides. This limit includes the JSON
formatting characters of the override structure.

Type: [TaskOverride](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_TaskOverride.html) object

Required: No

**[placementConstraints](#API_RunTask_RequestSyntax)**

An array of placement constraint objects to use for the task. You can specify up to 10
constraints for each task (including constraints in the task definition and those
specified at runtime).

Type: Array of [PlacementConstraint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PlacementConstraint.html) objects

Required: No

**[placementStrategy](#API_RunTask_RequestSyntax)**

The placement strategy objects to use for the task. You can specify a maximum of 5
strategy rules for each task.

Type: Array of [PlacementStrategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PlacementStrategy.html) objects

Required: No

**[platformVersion](#API_RunTask_RequestSyntax)**

The platform version the task uses. A platform version is only specified for tasks
hosted on Fargate. If one isn't specified, the `LATEST` platform version is
used. For more information, see [AWS Fargate\
platform versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service_
_Developer Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**[propagateTags](#API_RunTask_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition to the task. If no
value is specified, the tags aren't propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the task
during task creation. To add tags to a task after task creation, use the [TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html) API action.

###### Note

An error will be received if you specify the `SERVICE` option when
running a task.

Type: String

Valid Values: `TASK_DEFINITION | SERVICE | NONE`

Required: No

**[referenceId](#API_RunTask_RequestSyntax)**

This parameter is only used by Amazon ECS. It is not intended for use by
customers.

Type: String

Required: No

**[startedBy](#API_RunTask_RequestSyntax)**

An optional tag specified when a task is started. For example, if you automatically
trigger a task to run a batch process job, you could apply a unique identifier for that
job to your task with the `startedBy` parameter. You can then identify which
tasks belong to that job by filtering the results of a [ListTasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ListTasks.html) call with
the `startedBy` value. Up to 128 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers,
hyphens (-), forward slash (/), and underscores (\_) are allowed.

If a task is started by an Amazon ECS service, then the `startedBy`
parameter contains the deployment ID of the service that starts it.

Type: String

Required: No

**[tags](#API_RunTask_RequestSyntax)**

The metadata that you apply to the task to help you categorize and organize them. Each
tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

- Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

- For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only
one value.

- Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

- Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

- If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources,
remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters.
Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in
UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . \_ : / @.

- Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

- Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase
combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for
AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with
this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource
limit.

Type: Array of [Tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_Tag.html) objects

Array Members: Minimum number of 0 items. Maximum number of 50 items.

Required: No

**[taskDefinition](#API_RunTask_RequestSyntax)**

The `family` and `revision` ( `family:revision`) or
full ARN of the task definition to run. If a `revision` isn't specified, the
latest `ACTIVE` revision is used.

The full ARN value must match the value that you specified as the
`Resource` of the principal's permissions policy.

When you specify a task definition, you must either specify a specific revision, or
all revisions in the ARN.

To specify a specific revision, include the revision number in the ARN. For example,
to specify revision 2, use
`arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111122223333:task-definition/TaskFamilyName:2`.

To specify all revisions, use the wildcard (\*) in the ARN. For example, to specify all
revisions, use
`arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111122223333:task-definition/TaskFamilyName:*`.

For more information, see [Policy Resources for Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-resources) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service
Developer Guide.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**[volumeConfigurations](#API_RunTask_RequestSyntax)**

The details of the volume that was `configuredAtLaunch`. You can configure
the size, volumeType, IOPS, throughput, snapshot and encryption in [TaskManagedEBSVolumeConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_TaskManagedEBSVolumeConfiguration.html). The `name` of the volume must
match the `name` from the task definition.

Type: Array of [TaskVolumeConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_TaskVolumeConfiguration.html) objects

Required: No

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[failures](#API_RunTask_ResponseSyntax)**

Any failures associated with the call.

For information about how to address failures, see [Service event messages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-event-messages.html#service-event-messages-list) and [API failure\
reasons](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/api_failures_messages.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer_
_Guide_.

Type: Array of [Failure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_Failure.html) objects

**[tasks](#API_RunTask_ResponseSyntax)**

A full description of the tasks that were run. The tasks that were successfully placed
on your cluster are described here.

**message**

Message that describes the cause of the exception.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ConflictException**

The request could not be processed because of conflict in the current state of the
resource.

**message**

## Examples

In the following example or examples, the Authorization header contents
( `AUTHPARAMS`) must be replaced with an AWS Signature
Version 4 signature. For more information, see [Signature\
Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) in the _AWS_
_General Reference_.

You only need to learn how to sign HTTP requests if you intend to create them
manually. When you use the [AWS Command Line Interface](http://aws.amazon.com/cli) or one of the [AWS SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools) to make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the requests for you, with the
access key that you specify when you configure the tools. When you use these tools,
you don't have to sign requests yourself.

### Example

This example request runs the latest `ACTIVE` revision of the
`hello_world` task definition family in the default
cluster.
