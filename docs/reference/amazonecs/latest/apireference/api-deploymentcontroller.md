# DeploymentController

The deployment controller to use for the service.

**type**

The deployment controller type to use.

The deployment controller is the mechanism that determines how tasks are deployed for
your service. The valid options are:

- ECS

When you create a service which uses the `ECS` deployment
controller, you can choose between the following deployment strategies:

- `ROLLING`: When you create a service which uses the
_rolling update_ ( `ROLLING`)
deployment strategy, the Amazon ECS service scheduler replaces the
currently running tasks with new tasks. The number of tasks that Amazon
ECS adds or removes from the service during a rolling update is
controlled by the service deployment configuration.

Rolling update deployments are best suited for the following
scenarios:

- Gradual service updates: You need to update your service
incrementally without taking the entire service offline at
once.

- Limited resource requirements: You want to avoid the
additional resource costs of running two complete environments
simultaneously (as required by blue/green deployments).

- Acceptable deployment time: Your application can tolerate a
longer deployment process, as rolling updates replace tasks one
by one.

- No need for instant roll back: Your service can tolerate a
rollback process that takes minutes rather than seconds.

- Simple deployment process: You prefer a straightforward
deployment approach without the complexity of managing multiple
environments, target groups, and listeners.

- No load balancer requirement: Your service doesn't use or
require a load balancer, Application Load Balancer, Network Load
Balancer, or Service Connect (which are required for blue/green
deployments).

- Stateful applications: Your application maintains state that
makes it difficult to run two parallel environments.

- Cost sensitivity: You want to minimize deployment costs by not
running duplicate environments during deployment.

Rolling updates are the default deployment strategy for services and
provide a balance between deployment safety and resource efficiency for
many common application scenarios.

- `BLUE_GREEN`: A _blue/green_ deployment
strategy ( `BLUE_GREEN`) is a release methodology that reduces
downtime and risk by running two identical production environments
called blue and green. With Amazon ECS blue/green deployments, you can
validate new service revisions before directing production traffic to
them. This approach provides a safer way to deploy changes with the
ability to quickly roll back if needed.

Amazon ECS blue/green deployments are best suited for the following
scenarios:

- Service validation: When you need to validate new service
revisions before directing production traffic to them

- Zero downtime: When your service requires zero-downtime
deployments

- Instant roll back: When you need the ability to quickly roll
back if issues are detected

- Load balancer requirement: When your service uses Application
Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or Service Connect

- External

Use a third-party deployment controller.

- Blue/green deployment (powered by AWS CodeDeploy)

AWS CodeDeploy installs an updated version of the application as a new
replacement task set and reroutes production traffic from the original
application task set to the replacement task set. The original task set is
terminated after a successful deployment. Use this deployment controller to
verify a new deployment of a service before sending production traffic to
it.
