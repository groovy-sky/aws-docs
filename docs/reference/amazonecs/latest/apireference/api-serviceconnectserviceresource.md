# ServiceConnectServiceResource

The Service Connect resource. Each configuration maps a discovery name to a AWS Cloud Map
service name. The data is stored in AWS Cloud Map as part of the Service Connect
configuration for each discovery name of this Amazon ECS service.

A task can resolve the `dnsName` for each of the `clientAliases`
of a service. However a task can't resolve the discovery names. If you want to connect
to a service, refer to the `ServiceConnectConfiguration` of that service for
the list of `clientAliases` that you can use.

## Contents

**discoveryArn**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the service in AWS Cloud Map that matches the
discovery name for this Service Connect resource. You can use this ARN in other
integrations with AWS Cloud Map. However, Service Connect can't ensure connectivity outside of Amazon
ECS.

Type: String

Required: No

**discoveryName**

The discovery name of this Service Connect resource.

The `discoveryName` is the name of the new AWS Cloud Map service that Amazon ECS
creates for this Amazon ECS service. This must be unique within the AWS Cloud Map namespace. The
name can contain up to 64 characters. The name can include lowercase letters, numbers,
underscores (\_), and hyphens (-). The name can't start with a hyphen.

If the `discoveryName` isn't specified, the port mapping name from the task
definition is used in `portName.namespace`.

Type: String
