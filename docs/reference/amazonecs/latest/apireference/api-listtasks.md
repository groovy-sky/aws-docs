# ListTasks

Returns a list of tasks. You can filter the results by cluster, task definition
family, container instance, launch type, what IAM principal started the task, or by the
desired status of the task.

Recently stopped tasks might appear in the returned results.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "cluster": "string",
   "containerInstance": "string",
   "daemonName": "string",
   "desiredStatus": "string",
   "family": "string",
   "launchType": "string",
   "maxResults": number,
   "nextToken": "string",
   "serviceName": "string",
   "startedBy": "string"
}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[cluster](#API_ListTasks_RequestSyntax)**

The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster to use when filtering
the `ListTasks` results. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster
is assumed.

Type: String

Required: No

**[containerInstance](#API_ListTasks_RequestSyntax)**

The container instance ID or full ARN of the container instance to use when filtering
the `ListTasks` results. Specifying a `containerInstance` limits
the results to tasks that belong to that container instance.

Type: String

Required: No

**[daemonName](#API_ListTasks_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the daemon to use when filtering the `ListTasks` results.
Specifying a `daemonName` limits the results to tasks that belong to that
daemon.

Type: String

Required: No

**[desiredStatus](#API_ListTasks_RequestSyntax)**

The task desired status to use when filtering the `ListTasks` results.
Specifying a `desiredStatus` of `STOPPED` limits the results to
tasks that Amazon ECS has set the desired status to `STOPPED`. This can be
useful for debugging tasks that aren't starting properly or have died or finished. The
default status filter is `RUNNING`, which shows tasks that Amazon ECS has set
the desired status to `RUNNING`.

###### Note

Although you can filter results based on a desired status of `PENDING`,
this doesn't return any results. Amazon ECS never sets the desired status of a task
to that value (only a task's `lastStatus` may have a value of
`PENDING`).

Type: String

Valid Values: `RUNNING | PENDING | STOPPED`

Required: No

**[family](#API_ListTasks_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the task definition family to use when filtering the
`ListTasks` results. Specifying a `family` limits the results
to tasks that belong to that family.

Type: String

Required: No

**[launchType](#API_ListTasks_RequestSyntax)**

The launch type to use when filtering the `ListTasks` results.

Type: String

Valid Values: `EC2 | FARGATE | EXTERNAL | MANAGED_INSTANCES`

Required: No

**[maxResults](#API_ListTasks_RequestSyntax)**

The maximum number of task results that `ListTasks` returned in paginated
output. When this parameter is used, `ListTasks` only returns
`maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken`
response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending
another `ListTasks` request with the returned `nextToken` value.
This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then
`ListTasks` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value
if applicable.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**[nextToken](#API_ListTasks_RequestSyntax)**

The `nextToken` value returned from a `ListTasks` request
indicating that more results are available to fulfill the request and further calls will
be needed. If `maxResults` was provided, it's possible the number of results
to be fewer than `maxResults`.

###### Note

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve
the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.

Type: String

Required: No

**[serviceName](#API_ListTasks_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the service to use when filtering the `ListTasks` results.
Specifying a `serviceName` limits the results to tasks that belong to that
service.

Type: String

Required: No

**[startedBy](#API_ListTasks_RequestSyntax)**

The `startedBy` value to filter the task results with. Specifying a
`startedBy` value limits the results to tasks that were started with that
value.

When you specify `startedBy` as the filter, it must be the only filter that
you use.

Type: String

Required: No

## Response Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "nextToken": "string",
   "taskArns": [ "string" ]
}
```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[nextToken](#API_ListTasks_ResponseSyntax)**

The `nextToken` value to include in a future `ListTasks`
request. When the results of a `ListTasks` request exceed
`maxResults`, this value can be used to retrieve the next page of
results. This value is `null` when there are no more results to
return.

Type: String

**[taskArns](#API_ListTasks_ResponseSyntax)**

The list of task ARN entries for the `ListTasks` request.

Type: Array of strings

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**ClientException**

These errors are usually caused by a client action. This client action might be using
an action or resource on behalf of a user that doesn't have permissions to use the
action or resource. Or, it might be specifying an identifier that isn't valid.

**message**

Message that describes the cause of the exception.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ClusterNotFoundException**

The specified cluster wasn't found. You can view your available clusters with [ListClusters](api-listclusters.md). Amazon ECS clusters are Region specific.

**message**

Message that describes the cause of the exception.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InvalidParameterException**

The specified parameter isn't valid. Review the available parameters for the API
request.

For more information about service event errors, see [Amazon ECS\
service event messages](../../../../services/amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-event-messages-list.md).

**message**

Message that describes the cause of the exception.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ServerException**

These errors are usually caused by a server issue.

**message**

Message that describes the cause of the exception.

HTTP Status Code: 500

**ServiceNotFoundException**

The specified service wasn't found. You can view your available services with [ListServices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ListServices.html). Amazon ECS services are cluster specific and Region
specific.

**message**

Message that describes the cause of the exception.

HTTP Status Code: 400

## Examples

In the following example or examples, the Authorization header contents
( `AUTHPARAMS`) must be replaced with an AWS Signature
Version 4 signature. For more information, see [Signature\
Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) in the _AWS_
_General Reference_.

You only need to learn how to sign HTTP requests if you intend to create them
manually. When you use the [AWS Command Line Interface](http://aws.amazon.com/cli) or one of the [AWS SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools) to make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the requests for you, with the
access key that you specify when you configure the tools. When you use these tools,
you don't have to sign requests yourself.

### Example

This example request lists all of the tasks in the default cluster.
