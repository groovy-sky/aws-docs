# GetMetricStatistics

Gets statistics for the specified metric.

The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If you
request more than 1,440 data points, CloudWatch returns an error. To reduce the number
of data points, you can narrow the specified time range and make multiple requests
across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period. Data points are
not returned in chronological order.

CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you
specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period, CloudWatch
aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each one-hour period.
Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of
data points returned.

CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish
data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this
data if one of the following conditions is true:

- The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1.

- The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal.

Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values
are negative numbers.

Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:

- Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3
hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for
custom metrics that have been defined with a `StorageResolution` of
1.

- Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15
days.

- Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63
days.

- Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455
days (15 months).

Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated
together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1
minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days,
this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution
of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a
resolution of 1 hour.

CloudWatch started retaining 5-minute and 1-hour metric data as of July 9,
2016.

services, see the [Amazon CloudWatch\
Metrics and Dimensions Reference](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cw-support-for-aws.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User_
_Guide_.

## Request Parameters

**Dimensions**

The dimensions. If the metric contains multiple dimensions, you must include a
value for each dimension. CloudWatch treats each unique combination of dimensions as a
separate metric. If a specific combination of dimensions was not published, you can't
retrieve statistics for it. You must specify the same dimensions that were used when the
metrics were created. For an example, see [Dimension Combinations](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-concepts.md#dimension-combinations) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User_
_Guide_. For more information about specifying dimensions, see [Publishing Metrics](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/publishingmetrics.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User_
_Guide_.

Type: Array of [Dimension](api-dimension.md) objects

Array Members: Maximum number of 30 items.

Required: No

**EndTime**

The time stamp that determines the last data point to return.

The value specified is exclusive; results include data points up to the specified
time stamp. In a raw HTTP query, the time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format (for
example, 2016-10-10T23:00:00Z).

Type: Timestamp

Required: Yes

**ExtendedStatistics**

The percentile statistics. Specify values between p0.0 and p100. When calling
`GetMetricStatistics`, you must specify either `Statistics` or
`ExtendedStatistics`, but not both. Percentile statistics are not
available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers.

Type: Array of strings

Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number of 10 items.

Required: No

**MetricName**

The name of the metric, with or without spaces.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 255.

Required: Yes

**Namespace**

The namespace of the metric, with or without spaces.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 255.

Pattern: `[^:].*`

Required: Yes

**Period**

The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular
resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple
of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one
minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution
metrics are those metrics stored by a `PutMetricData` call that includes a
`StorageResolution` of 1 second.

If the `StartTime` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than
3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range
is returned:

- Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds
(1 minute).

- Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5
minutes).

- Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1
hour).

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1.

Required: Yes

**StartTime**

The time stamp that determines the first data point to return. Start times are
evaluated relative to the time that CloudWatch receives the request.

The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the specified
time stamp. In a raw HTTP query, the time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format (for
example, 2016-10-03T23:00:00Z).

CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:

- Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole minute.
For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00.

- Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 5-minute
clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:30:00.

- Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 1-hour
clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:00:00.

If you set `Period` to 5, 10, 20, or 30, the start time of your request is
rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, 20-, or 30-second
divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the
previous 10-second period, the start time of your request is rounded down and you
receive data from 01:05:10 to 01:05:20. If you make a query at 15:07:17 for the previous
5 minutes of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped between
15:02:15 and 15:07:15.

Type: Timestamp

Required: Yes

**Statistics**

The metric statistics, other than percentile. For percentile statistics, use
`ExtendedStatistics`. When calling `GetMetricStatistics`, you
must specify either `Statistics` or `ExtendedStatistics`, but not
both.

Type: Array of strings

Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number of 5 items.

Valid Values: `SampleCount | Average | Sum | Minimum | Maximum`

Required: No

**Unit**

The unit for a given metric. If you omit `Unit`, all data that was
collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were
specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation
returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit
that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null.
CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

Type: String

Valid Values: `Seconds | Microseconds | Milliseconds | Bytes | Kilobytes | Megabytes | Gigabytes | Terabytes | Bits | Kilobits | Megabits | Gigabits | Terabits | Percent | Count | Bytes/Second | Kilobytes/Second | Megabytes/Second | Gigabytes/Second | Terabytes/Second | Bits/Second | Kilobits/Second | Megabits/Second | Gigabits/Second | Terabits/Second | Count/Second | None`

Required: No
