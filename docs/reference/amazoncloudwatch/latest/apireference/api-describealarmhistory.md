# DescribeAlarmHistory

Retrieves the history for the specified alarm. You can filter the results by date
range or item type. If an alarm name is not specified, the histories for either all
metric alarms or all composite alarms are returned.

CloudWatch retains the history of an alarm even if you delete the alarm.

To use this operation and return information about a composite alarm, you must be
signed on with the `cloudwatch:DescribeAlarmHistory` permission that is
scoped to `*`. You can't return information about composite alarms if your
`cloudwatch:DescribeAlarmHistory` permission has a narrower scope.
