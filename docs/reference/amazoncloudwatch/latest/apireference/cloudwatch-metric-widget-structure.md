## Overall Structure

The `MetricWidget` string can include the following parameters:

**metrics**

The metrics to include in the graph, as a
`metrics` array. This can include both raw metric and metric
math expressions. One `metrics` array can include
1–100 metrics and expressions. For more
information about the format of `metrics`, see [Format for Each Metric in the Array of Metrics](#CloudWatch-Metric-Widget-Metrics-Array-Format).

Type: Array of arrays

Required: Yes.

**start**

The date and time for the start of the metrics shown in the graph. This can be expressed as either an absolute value, such as
**2018-04-25T12:00:00.000Z** or a relative value such as **-PID**.

If you don't specify `start`, the default of `-PT3H` (three hours ago) is used.

Type: String

Required: No

**stat**

The default statistic to be displayed for each metric
in the array. This
default can be overridden within the definition of each individual metric in
the `metrics` array.

If you omit this, the default of `Average` is used.

Valid Values: `SampleCount` \| `Average` \|
`Sum` \| `Minimum` \| `Maximum` \|

**yAxis**

Limits for the minimums and maximums of the y-axis. This applies to every metric
being graphed, unless specific metrics override it. For more
information about the format, see
[yAxis Properties Format](#CloudWatch-Metric-Widget-YAxis-Properties-Format).

Type: YAxis object

Required: No

## Format for Each Metric in the Array of Metrics

Each item in the `metrics` array is a CloudWatch metric to display in the graph,
or to use as part of a math expression displayed in the graph. For more information
about math expressions, see [Use Metric\
Math](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.md) in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.

Each metric in the array has the following format:

```nohighlight

[Namespace, MetricName, Dimension1Name, Dimension1Value, Dimension2Name, Dimension2Value...
            {Options Object}]
```

**Namespace**

The AWS namespace containing the metric. To use the same namespace as the previous metric
in the array, you may specify
`"."` for each entry after the first.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**MetricName**

The name of the CloudWatch metric. To use the same name as the previous metric
in the array, you may specify
`"."` for each entry after the first.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**DimensionName**

The name of a dimension to further refine what data is shown. To use the
same dimension name as the previous metric in the array, you may specify
`"."` for each entry after the first. You may specify zero
dimensions for a metric, or up to as many dimensions as the metric
supports.

Type: String

Required: No

**DimensionValue**

The value to use for that dimension for the metric. Required if there is a corresponding dimension name.

Type: String

Required: No, unless there is a corresponding dimension name.

**Options Object**

Specifies either custom rendering properties to be used for the specified CloudWatch metric, or a math expression to display
on the graph. For more
information about the format, see
[Options Object Format](#CloudWatch-Metric-Widget-Options-Object-Format).

Type: Options Object

Required: No

_Examples_

```nohighlight

// The simplest example, a metric with no dimensions
        [ "AWS/EC2", "CPUUtilization" ]

 // A metric with a single dimension
        [ "AWS/EC2", "CPUUtilization", "InstanceId", "i-01234567890123456" ]

 // A metric with a single dimension and rendering properties
        [ "AWS/EC2", "DiskReadBytes", "InstanceId", "i-01234567890123456", { yAxis: "right"} ]

 // The following example graphs the DiskReadBytes metric for three instances.
        [ "AWS/EC2", "DiskReadBytes", "InstanceId", "i-01234567890123456" ],
        [ ".", ".", ".", "i-abc" ],
        [ ".", ".", ".", "i-123" ]
```

### Options Object Format

Specifies either custom rendering properties to be used for the specified CloudWatch metric, or a math expression to display
on the graph.

If this object is specified as part of a CloudWatch metric in the `metrics`
array, it sets custom rendering properties for this metric and overrides the
defaults used for the whole graph.

You can also specify this object to add a math expression to the graph. In this case, the other settings in this
object specify the display options for the result of the math expression.

This section
describes the format of these options objects.

**color**

The six-digit HTML hex color code to be used for this metric or expression.

Type: String

Required: No

**expression**

A math expression to display. For more information about supported math expression functions and format,
see [Metric Math Syntax and Functions](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.md#metric-math-syntax)
in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.

Type: String that is a valid CloudWatch metric math expression.

Required: Yes if this is an expression.

**label**

The label to display for this metric or expression in the graph
legend. If this is not specified, the metric is given an auto-generated
label that distinguishes it from the other metrics in the widget.

Type: String

Required: No

**id**

An identifier for this metric or expression, which must be unique within this widget. The id can be used as a variable to represent
this metric or expression within math expressions. Valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore.
The first character must be a lowercase letter.

Type: String

Required: No

**period**

The period for this metric, in seconds. If specified, this overrides the default period used for other
metrics in this graph. This parameter is not applicable for math expressions.

Valid Values: 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, and any multiple of 60. 1, 5, 10, and 30 are only for high-resolution metrics.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**stat**

The statistic to be displayed for this metric, if it is to be different than the statistic used for the
other metrics in the graph. This parameter is not applicable for math expressions.

Valid Values: `SampleCount` \| `Average` \| `Sum` \| `Minimum` \| `Maximum` \|
`p??`

Type: String that is a valid CloudWatch statistic.

Required: No

**visible**

Specifies whether this metric or expression is shown on the graph. The default is `true`.

Setting `visible` to `false` is useful if you want to hide the raw metrics
that are used in math expressions, and show only the expression results on the graph.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**yAxis**

Where on the graph to display the y-axis for this metric or expression. The default is `left`.

Valid Values: `left` \| `right`

Type: String

Required: No

_Example_

In the following example, CloudWatch retrieves a custom `apiLatency` metric.
At the top, the p50 statistic is specified to show the median value. Next, for the
same metric on the same instance (this is specified by the four fields that are just
periods), the Average value is graphed. Next is an options object with a math
expression, showing the halfway value of the two metrics. Finally, another
expression shows the rate of change.

To show only the results of the two expressions on the graph and hide the raw
metrics, you could change the first two instances of `visible` to
`false`.

        ]
    }

```

## Annotation Properties Format

A single graph can have multiple horizontal and vertical annotations. All
horizontal annotations are specified in one `horizontal` field, and all
vertical annotations are specified in one `vertical` field.

**horizontal**

An array of horizontal annotations. Horizontal annotations have several options for fill shading, including shading above the
annotation line, shading below the annotation line, and "band" shading that appears between two linked annotation lines
as part of a single annotation. Each horizontal annotation in the array that does not have band shading has the
following format:

```nohighlight

{value, label, color, fill, yAxis, visible}
```

Each horizontal annotation that does have band shading has the following format:

```nohighlight

[{value, label, color, yAxis, visible}, {value, label}]
```

**vertical**

An array of vertical annotations. Vertical annotations have several options for fill shading, including shading before the
annotation line, shading after the annotation line, and "band" shading that appears between two linked annotation lines
as part of a single band annotation. Each vertical annotation in the array that does not have band shading has the
following format:

```nohighlight

{value, label, color, fill, visible}
```

Each vertical annotation that does have band shading has the following format:

```nohighlight

[{value, label, color, visible}, {value, label}]
```

The `horizontal` array can include the following fields.

**value**

The metric value in the graph where the horizontal annotation line is to appear. On a band shading annotation, the two values
for `Value` define the upper and lower edges of the band.

On a graph with horizontal annotations, the graph is scaled so that all visible horizontal annotations appear on the graph.

Type: Float

Required: Yes, if horizontal annotations are used.

**label**

A string that appears on the graph next to the annotation.

Type: String

Required: No

**color**

The six-digit HTML hex color code to be used for the annotation. This color is used for both the annotation line and the fill shading.

Type: String

Required: No

**fill**

How to use fill shading with the annotation. Valid values are
`above` for shading above the annotation,
`below` for shading below the annotation, and
`none` for no shading. If `fill` is
omitted, there is no shading.

The exception is an annotation with band shading. These annotations always have shading between the two values, and any value for `fill`
is ignored.

Type: String

Required: No

**visible**

Set this to `true` to have the annotation appear in the graph, or `false` to have it be hidden. The default
is `true`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**yAxis**

If the graph includes multiple metrics, specifies whether the numbers
in `Value` refer to the metric associated with the left
Y-axis or the right Y-axis. Valid values are `right`
and `left`.

Type: String

Required: No

The `vertical` array can include the following fields.

**value**

The time stamp where the vertical annotation line is to appear. This
must be specified as an absolute time stamp, such as
`2018-08-28T15:25:26Z`. On a band shading annotation, the two
values for `Value` define the beginning and ending edges of the
band.

Type: String

Required: Yes, if vertical annotations are used.

**label**

A descriptive string that appears on the graph next to the annotation.

Type: String

Required: No

**color**

The six-digit HTML hex color code to be used for the annotation. This color is used for both the annotation line and the fill shading.

Type: String

Required: No

**fill**

How to use fill shading with the annotation. Valid values are
`before` for shading before the annotation,
`after` for shading after the annotation, and
`none` for no shading. If `fill` is
omitted, there is no shading.

The exception is an annotation with band shading. These annotations always have shading between the two values, and any value for `fill`
is ignored.

Type: String

Required: No

**visible**

Set this to `true` to have the annotation appear in the graph, or `false` to have it be hidden. The default
is `true`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No
