# LabelOptions

This structure includes the `Timezone` parameter, which you can use to
specify your time zone so that the labels that are associated with returned metrics
display the correct time for your time zone.

The `Timezone` value affects a label only if you have a time-based dynamic
expression in the label. For more information about dynamic expressions in labels, see
[Using Dynamic\
Labels](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.md).

## Contents

**Timezone**

The time zone to use for metric data return in this operation. The format is
`+` or `-` followed by four digits. The first two digits
indicate the number of hours ahead or behind of UTC, and the final two digits are the
number of minutes. For example, +0130 indicates a time zone that is 1 hour and 30
minutes ahead of UTC. The default is +0000.

Type: String

Required: No
