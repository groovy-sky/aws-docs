# MetricStat

This structure defines the metric to be returned, along with the statistics, period,
and units.

## Contents

**Metric**

The metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions.

Type: [Metric](api-metric.md) object

Required: Yes

**Period**

The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular
resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple
of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one
minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution
metrics are those metrics stored by a `PutMetricData` call that includes a
`StorageResolution` of 1 second.

If the `StartTime` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than
3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range
is returned:

- Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds
(1 minute).

- Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5
minutes).

- Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1
hour).

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1.

Required: Yes

**Stat**

The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or extended
statistic.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**Unit**

When you are using a `Put` operation, this defines what unit you want to
use when storing the metric.

In a `Get` operation, if you omit `Unit` then all data that
was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were
specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation
returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit
that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null.
CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

Type: String

Valid Values: `Seconds | Microseconds | Milliseconds | Bytes | Kilobytes | Megabytes | Gigabytes | Terabytes | Bits | Kilobits | Megabits | Gigabits | Terabits | Percent | Count | Bytes/Second | Kilobytes/Second | Megabytes/Second | Gigabytes/Second | Terabytes/Second | Bits/Second | Kilobits/Second | Megabits/Second | Gigabits/Second | Terabits/Second | Count/Second | None`

Required: No
