# DescribeAnomalyDetectors

Lists the anomaly detection models that you have created in your account. For single
metric anomaly detectors, you can list all of the models in your account or filter the
results to only the models that are related to a certain namespace, metric name, or
metric dimension. For metric math anomaly detectors, you can list them by adding
`METRIC_MATH` to the `AnomalyDetectorTypes` array. This will
return all metric math anomaly detectors in your account.

## Request Parameters

**AnomalyDetectorTypes**

The anomaly detector types to request when using
`DescribeAnomalyDetectorsInput`. If empty, defaults to
`SINGLE_METRIC`.

Type: Array of strings

Array Members: Maximum number of 2 items.

Valid Values: `SINGLE_METRIC | METRIC_MATH`

Required: No

**Dimensions**

Limits the results to only the anomaly detection models that are associated with the
specified metric dimensions. If there are multiple metrics that have these dimensions
and have anomaly detection models associated, they're all returned.

Type: Array of [Dimension](api-dimension.md) objects

Array Members: Maximum number of 30 items.

Required: No

**MaxResults**

The maximum number of results to return in one operation. The maximum value that you
can specify is 100.

To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned
`NextToken` value.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1.

Required: No

**MetricName**

Limits the results to only the anomaly detection models that are associated with the
specified metric name. If there are multiple metrics with this name in different
namespaces that have anomaly detection models, they're all returned.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 255.

Required: No

**Namespace**

Limits the results to only the anomaly detection models that are associated with the
specified namespace.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 255.

Pattern: `[^:].*`

Required: No

**NextToken**

Use the token returned by the previous operation to request the next page of
results.

Type: String

Required: No

## Response Elements

The following elements are returned by the service.

**AnomalyDetectors**

The list of anomaly detection models returned by the operation.

Type: Array of [AnomalyDetector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_AnomalyDetector.html) objects

**NextToken**

A token that you can use in a subsequent operation to retrieve the next set of
results.

Type: String

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**InternalServiceError**

Request processing has failed due to some unknown error, exception, or
failure.

**Message**

HTTP Status Code: 500

**InvalidNextToken**

The next token specified is invalid.

**message**

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InvalidParameterCombination**

Parameters were used together that cannot be used together.

**message**

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InvalidParameterValue**

The value of an input parameter is bad or out-of-range.

**message**

HTTP Status Code: 400

## Examples

### Example

The following example lists all the anomaly detectors for metrics with the
name `CPUUtilization`.
