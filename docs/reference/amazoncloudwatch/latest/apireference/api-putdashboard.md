# PutDashboard

Creates a dashboard if it does not already exist, or updates an existing dashboard.
If you update a dashboard, the entire contents are replaced with what you specify
here.

All dashboards in your account are global, not region-specific.

A simple way to create a dashboard using `PutDashboard` is to copy an
existing dashboard. To copy an existing dashboard using the console, you can load the
dashboard and then use the View/edit source command in the Actions menu to display the
JSON block for that dashboard. Another way to copy a dashboard is to use
`GetDashboard`, and then use the data returned within
`DashboardBody` as the template for the new dashboard when you call
`PutDashboard`.

When you create a dashboard with `PutDashboard`, a good practice is to
add a text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message that the dashboard was
created by script and should not be changed in the console. This message could also
point console users to the location of the `DashboardBody` script or the
CloudFormation template used to create the dashboard.

## Request Parameters

**DashboardBody**

The detailed information about the dashboard in JSON format, including the widgets
to include and their location on the dashboard. This parameter is required.

For more information about the syntax, see [Dashboard Body Structure and Syntax](cloudwatch-dashboard-body-structure.md).

Type: String

Required: Yes

**DashboardName**

The name of the dashboard. If a dashboard with this name already exists, this call
modifies that dashboard, replacing its current contents. Otherwise, a new dashboard is
created. The maximum length is 255, and valid characters are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "-", and
"\_". This parameter is required.

Type: String

Required: Yes

## Response Elements

The following element is returned by the service.

**DashboardValidationMessages**

If the input for `PutDashboard` was correct and the dashboard was
successfully created or modified, this result is empty.

If this result includes only warning messages, then the input was valid enough for
the dashboard to be created or modified, but some elements of the dashboard might not
render.

If this result includes error messages, the input was not valid and the operation
failed.

Type: Array of [DashboardValidationMessage](api-dashboardvalidationmessage.md) objects

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**ConflictException**

This operation attempted to create a resource that already exists.

HTTP Status Code: 409

**InternalServiceError**

Request processing has failed due to some unknown error, exception, or
failure.

**Message**

HTTP Status Code: 500

**InvalidParameterInput**

Some part of the dashboard data is invalid.

HTTP Status Code: 400

## Examples

### Example

The following example creates a dashboard with just one text
widget.

```

{
"DashboardName":"Dashboard with only one text widget",
"DashboardBody":{
   "widgets":[
      {
         "type":"text",
         "x":0,
         "y":7,
         "width":3,
         "height":3,
         "properties":{
            "markdown":"Hello world"
         }
      }
   ]
}
}
```

### Example

The following example modifies an existing dashboard to include one metric
widget and one text widget.

```

{
    "DashboardName": "Two-Widget Dashboard",
    "DashboardBody": {
        "widgets": [
            {
                "type": "metric",
                "x": 0,
                "y": 0,
                "width": 12,
                "height": 6,
                "properties": {
                    "metrics": [
                        [
                            "AWS/EC2",

                            "InstanceId",
                            "i-012345"
                        ]
                    ],
                    "period": 300,
                    "stat": "Average",
                    "region": "us-east-1",
                    "title": "EC2 Instance CPU"
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "text",
                "x": 0,
                "y": 7,
                "width": 3,
                "height": 3,
                "properties": {
                    "markdown": "Hello world"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Example

side.

```
