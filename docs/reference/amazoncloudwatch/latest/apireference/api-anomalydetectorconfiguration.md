# AnomalyDetectorConfiguration

The configuration specifies details about how the anomaly detection model is to be
trained, including time ranges to exclude from use for training the model and the time
zone to use for the metric.

## Contents

**ExcludedTimeRanges**

An array of time ranges to exclude from use when the anomaly detection model is
trained. Use this to make sure that events that could cause unusual values for the
metric, such as deployments, aren't used when CloudWatch creates the model.

Type: Array of [Range](api-range.md) objects

Required: No

**MetricTimezone**

The time zone to use for the metric. This is useful to enable the model to
automatically account for daylight savings time changes if the metric is sensitive to
such time changes.

To specify a time zone, use the name of the time zone as specified in the standard
tz database. For more information, see [tz database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database).

Type: String

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 50.

Pattern: `.*`

Required: No
