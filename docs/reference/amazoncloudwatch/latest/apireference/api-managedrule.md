**Tags**

A list of key-value pairs that you can associate with a managed Contributor Insights
rule. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a rule. Tags can help you organize and
categorize your resources. You also can use them to scope user permissions by granting a
user permission to access or change only the resources that have certain tag values. To
associate tags with a rule, you must have the `cloudwatch:TagResource`
permission in addition to the `cloudwatch:PutInsightRule` permission. If you
are using this operation to update an existing Contributor Insights rule, any tags that
you specify in this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of an existing rule, use
`TagResource`.

Type: Array of [Tag](api-tag.md) objects

Required: No
