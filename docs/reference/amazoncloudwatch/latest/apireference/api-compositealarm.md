# CompositeAlarm

The details about a composite alarm.

## Contents

**ActionsEnabled**

Indicates whether actions should be executed during any changes to the alarm
state.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**ActionsSuppressedBy**

When the value is `ALARM`, it means that the actions are suppressed
because the suppressor alarm is in `ALARM` When the value is
`WaitPeriod`, it means that the actions are suppressed because the
composite alarm is waiting for the suppressor alarm to go into into the
`ALARM` state. The maximum waiting time is as specified in
`ActionsSuppressorWaitPeriod`. After this time, the composite alarm
performs its actions. When the value is `ExtensionPeriod`, it means that the
actions are suppressed because the composite alarm is waiting after the suppressor alarm
went out of the `ALARM` state. The maximum waiting time is as specified in
`ActionsSuppressorExtensionPeriod`. After this time, the composite alarm
performs its actions.

Type: String

Valid Values: `WaitPeriod | ExtensionPeriod | Alarm`

Required: No

**ActionsSuppressedReason**

Captures the reason for action suppression.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 1024.

Required: No

**ActionsSuppressor**

Actions will be suppressed if the suppressor alarm is in the `ALARM`
state. `ActionsSuppressor` can be an AlarmName or an Amazon Resource Name
(ARN) from an existing alarm.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1600.

Required: No

**ActionsSuppressorExtensionPeriod**

The maximum time in seconds that the composite alarm waits after suppressor alarm
goes out of the `ALARM` state. After this time, the composite alarm performs
its actions.

###### Important

`ExtensionPeriod` is required only when `ActionsSuppressor` is
specified.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**ActionsSuppressorWaitPeriod**

The maximum time in seconds that the composite alarm waits for the suppressor alarm
to go into the `ALARM` state. After this time, the composite alarm performs
its actions.

###### Important

`WaitPeriod` is required only when `ActionsSuppressor` is
specified.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**AlarmActions**

The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the ALARM state from any other
state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

Type: Array of strings

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

Required: No

**AlarmArn**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the alarm.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1600.

Required: No

**AlarmConfigurationUpdatedTimestamp**

The time stamp of the last update to the alarm configuration.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

Required: No

**AlarmRule**

The rule that this alarm uses to evaluate its alarm state.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 10240.

Required: No

**InsufficientDataActions**

The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the INSUFFICIENT\_DATA state from
any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

Type: Array of strings

Array Members: Maximum number of 5 items.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

Required: No

**OKActions**

The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the OK state from any other
state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

Type: Array of strings

Array Members: Maximum number of 5 items.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

Required: No

**StateReason**

An explanation for the alarm state, in text format.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 1023.

Required: No

**StateReasonData**

An explanation for the alarm state, in JSON format.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 4000.

Required: No
