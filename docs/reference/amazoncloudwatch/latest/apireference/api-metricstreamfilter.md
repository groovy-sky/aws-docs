# MetricStreamFilter

This structure contains a metric namespace and optionally, a list of metric names, to
either include in a metric stream or exclude from a metric stream.

A metric stream's filters can include up to 1000 total names. This limit applies to
the sum of namespace names and metric names in the filters. For example, this could
include 10 metric namespace filters with 99 metrics each, or 20 namespace filters with
49 metrics specified in each filter.

## Contents

**MetricNames**

The names of the metrics to either include or exclude from the metric stream.

If you omit this parameter, all metrics in the namespace are included or excluded,
depending on whether this filter is specified as an exclude filter or an include
filter.

Each metric name can contain only ASCII printable characters (ASCII range 32 through
126). Each metric name must contain at least one non-whitespace character.

Type: Array of strings

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 255.

Required: No

126). It must contain at least one non-whitespace character.
