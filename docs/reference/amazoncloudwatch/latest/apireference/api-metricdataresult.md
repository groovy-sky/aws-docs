# MetricDataResult

A `GetMetricData` call returns an array of `MetricDataResult`
structures. Each of these structures includes the data points for that metric, along
with the timestamps of those data points and other identifying information.

## Contents

**Id**

The short name you specified to represent this metric.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 255.

Required: No

**Label**

The human-readable label associated with the data.

Type: String

Required: No

**Messages**

A list of messages with additional information about the data returned.

Type: Array of [MessageData](api-messagedata.md) objects

Required: No

**StatusCode**

The status of the returned data. `Complete` indicates that all data points
in the requested time range were returned. `PartialData` means that an
incomplete set of data points were returned. You can use the `NextToken`
value that was returned and repeat your request to get more data points.
`NextToken` is not returned if you are performing a math expression.
`InternalError` indicates that an error occurred. Retry your request
using `NextToken`, if present.

Type: String

Valid Values: `Complete | InternalError | PartialData | Forbidden`

Required: No

**Timestamps**

The timestamps for the data points, formatted in Unix timestamp format. The number of
timestamps always matches the number of values and the value for Timestamps\[x\] is
Values\[x\].

Type: Array of timestamps

Required: No

**Values**

The data points for the metric corresponding to `Timestamps`. The number of
values always matches the number of timestamps and the timestamp for Values\[x\] is
Timestamps\[x\].

Type: Array of doubles

Required: No
