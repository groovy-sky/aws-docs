# MessageData

A message returned by the `GetMetricData` API, including a code and a
description.

If a cross-Region `GetMetricData` operation fails with a code of
`Forbidden` and a value of `Authentication too complex to retrieve
                cross region data`, you can correct the problem by running the
`GetMetricData` operation in the same Region where the metric data
is.
