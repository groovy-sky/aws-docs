# Dimension

A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. Because
dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique
name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric.
For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish `InstanceId` as a
dimension name, and the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.

You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.
