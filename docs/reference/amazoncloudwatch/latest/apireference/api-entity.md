# Entity

An entity associated with metrics, to allow for finding related telemetry. An entity
is typically a resource or service within your system. For example, metrics from an
Amazon EC2 instance could be associated with that instance as the entity.
Similarly, metrics from a service that you own could be associated with that service as
the entity.

For details about how to use the attributes, see [How \

**KeyAttributes**

The attributes of the entity which identify the specific entity, as a list of
key-value pairs. Entities with the same `KeyAttributes` are considered to be
the same entity. For an entity to be valid, the `KeyAttributes` must exist
and be formatted correctly.

There are five allowed attributes (key names): `Type`,
`ResourceType`, `Identifier`, `Name`, and
`Environment`.

For details about how to use the key attributes to specify an entity, see [How \
to add related \
information to telemetry](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/adding-your-own-related-telemetry.md) in the _CloudWatch User_
_Guide_.
