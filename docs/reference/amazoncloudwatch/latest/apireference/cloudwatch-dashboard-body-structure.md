## Overall Structure

A `DashboardBody` is a string in JSON format. It can include an array of
between 0 and 500 widget objects, as well as a few other parameters. The dashboard must include
a `widgets` array, but that array can be empty.

The following is an example of this structure with one metric widget and one text widget, a time range starting six hours before the current time,
and each graph's period setting always being obeyed.

```json

{
   "start": "-PT6H",
   "periodOverride": "inherit",
   "widgets": [
      {
         "type":"metric",
         "x":0,
         "y":0,
         "width":12,
         "height":6,
         "properties":{
            "metrics":[
               [
                  "AWS/EC2",
                  "CPUUtilization",
                  "InstanceId",
                  "i-012345"
               ]
            ],
            "period":300,
            "stat":"Average",
            "region":"us-east-1",
            "title":"EC2 Instance CPU",
            "liveData": false,
            "legend": {
                "position": "right"
              }
         }
      },
      {
         "type":"text",
         "x":0,
         "y":7,
         "width":3,
         "height":3,
         "properties":{
            "markdown":"Hello world"
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

The next example displays three Lambda per-function metrics, and uses a dashboard variable so that dashboard users
can switch between different Lambda function names and see all three metrics for each function. This helps you create a single flexible
dashboard that can display key metrics for different resources. In this example the functions are discovered by a metric
search query, so the dashboard automatically discovers new Lambda functions when they are created.

```json

{
    "widgets": [{
            "height": 6,
            "width": 6,
            "y": 0,
            "x": 0,
            "type": "metric",
            "properties": {
                "view": "timeSeries",
                "stacked": false,
                "metrics": ["AWS/Lambda", "Invocations", "FunctionName", "my-function-name"],

                "region": "us-east-1",
                "liveData": true
            }
        },
        {
            "height": 12,
            "width": 12,
            "y": 0,
            "x": 6,
            "type": "metric",
            "properties": {
                "view": "timeSeries",
                "stacked": false,
                "metrics": ["AWS/Lambda", "Errors", "FunctionName", "my-function-name"],

                "region": "us-east-1",
                "liveData": true
            }
        },

        {
            "height": 3,
            "width": 6,
            "y": 0,
            "x": 18,
            "type": "metric",
            "properties": {
                "view": "timeSeries",
                "stacked": false,
                "metrics": ["AWS/Lambda", "Duration", "FunctionName", "my-function-name"],

                "region": "us-east-1",
                "liveData": true
            }
        }
    ],
    "variables": [{
        "type": "property",
        "property": "FunctionName",
        "inputType": "select",
        "id": "LambdaFunction_Variable",
        "label": "Function",
        "visible": true,
        "search": "{AWS/Lambda,FunctionName} MetricName=\"Duration\"",
        "populateFrom": "FunctionName"
    }]
}
```

The next example has two widgets. The first includes two metrics and a math expression that sums their total. The second widget
is a search expression that displays the `CPUUtilization` for all EC2 instances in the Region.

```json

{
   "start": "-PT9H",
   "periodOverride": "inherit",
   "widgets": [
      {
         "type":"metric",
         "x":0,
         "y":0,
         "width":12,
         "height":6,
         "properties":{
            "metrics":[
               [ "AWS/EC2", "DiskReadBytes", "InstanceId", "i-123",{ "id": "m1" } ],
               [ ".", ".", ".", "i-abc", { "id": "m2" } ],
               [ { "expression": "SUM(METRICS())", "label": "Sum of DiskReadbytes", "id": "e3" } ]
            ],
            "view": "timeSeries",
            "stacked": false,
            "period":300,
            "stat":"Average",
            "region":"us-east-1",
            "title":"EC2 Instance CPU"
         }
      },
      {
         "type":"metric",
         "x":0,
         "y":0,
         "width":18,
         "height":9,
         "properties":{
            "metrics":[
               [ { "expression": "SEARCH('{AWS/EC2,InstanceId} MetricName=\"CPUUtilization\"', 'Average', 300)", "id": "e1" } ]
            ],
            "view": "timeSeries",
            "stacked": false,
            "region":"us-east-1",
            "title":"EC2 Instance CPU"
         }
      }
   ]
}

```

The rest of this section includes examples illustrating each part of the `DashboardBody` syntax. For more examples showing
the entire command syntax, see [PutDashboard](api-putdashboard.md)
in the Amazon CloudWatch API Reference.

The top level of the JSON object can include the following properties.

**widgets**

The list of widgets in the dashboard. For more information, see
[Widgets Array Structure](#CloudWatch-Dashboard-Properties-Widgets-Structure).

Required: Yes

**variables**

The array of dashboard variable objects used in the dashboard. For more information about the fields that you
can use in each dashboard variable object, see
[Variables Array Structure](#CloudWatch-Dashboard-Properties-Variables-Structure).

For more information about dashboard variables, see
[Create flexible dashboards with dashboard variables](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-dashboard-variables.md).

If you include a `variables` array, it can contain between 0 and 25 variable objects.

Required: No

**end**

The end of the time range to use for each widget on the dashboard when the dashboard loads. If you specify a value for `end`, you must also
specify a value for `start`. For each of these values, specify an absolute time in the ISO 8601 format. For example,
`2018-12-17T06:00:00.000Z`.

Type: String

Required: No

**start**

The start of the time range to use for each widget on the dashboard.

You can specify `start` without specifying `end`
to specify a relative time range that ends with the current time. In this case, the value of `start` must begin with `-PT`
if you specify a time range in minutes or hours, and must begin with `-P` if you specify a time range in days, weeks, or months.
You can then use M, H, D, W and M as abbreviations for minutes, hours, days, weeks and months. For example,
`-PT5M` shows the last 5 minutes, `-PT8H` shows the last 8 hours, and `-P3M` shows the last three months.

You can also use `start` along with an `end` field, to specify an absolute time range. When specifying
an absolute time range, use the ISO 8601 format. For example,
`2018-12-17T06:00:00.000Z`.

If you omit `start`, the dashboard shows the default time range when it loads.

Type: String

Required: No

**periodOverride**

Use this field to specify the period for the graphs when the dashboard loads. Specifying `auto` causes the period of
all graphs on the dashboard to automatically adapt to the time range of the dashboard. Specifying `inherit` ensures that
the period set for each graph is always obeyed.

Valid Values: auto \| inherit

Type: String

Required: No

## Widgets Array Structure

Each widget of any type can have the following properties.

**type**

The type of widget.

Valid Values: `metric` \| `text` \| `log` \| `alarm` \| `explorer`

Type: String

Required: Yes

**x**

The horizontal position of the widget on the 24-column dashboard grid. The default is the next available position.

Valid Values: 0–23

Type: Integer

Required: Yes, if `y` is specified. Otherwise not required.

**y**

The vertical position of the widget on the 24-column dashboard grid. The default is the next available position.

Valid Values: Any integer, 0 or higher.

Type: Integer

Required: Yes, if `x` is specified. Otherwise not required.

**width**

The width of the widget in grid units (in a 24-column grid). The default is 6.

Valid Values: 1–24

Type: Integer

Required: No

**height**

The height of the widget in grid units. The default is 6.

Valid Values: 1–1000

Type: Integer

Required: No

**properties**

The detailed properties of the widget, which differ depending on the widget type. For more
information about the format of `properties`, see
[Properties of a Metric Widget Object](#CloudWatch-Dashboard-Properties-Metric-Widget-Object)
or [Properties of a Text Widget Object](#CloudWatch-Dashboard-Properties-Text-Widget-Object).

Type: Object

Required: Yes

## Variables Array Structure

Each dashboard variable in the array can have the following properties.

**type**

The type of dashboard variable. CloudWatch supports two types, _property variables_
and _pattern variables_.

Property variables change the values of all instances of a property in all widgets in the dashboard.
A property can be either of the following:

- Any JSON property in the widget definitions, such as `region`.

- Any dimension name for a metric, such as `InstanceId`
or `FunctionName`.

A pattern variable changes a regular expression pattern across the dashboard JSON. Use it
when you need to change just part of a JSON property value, or even a JSON property.

Property variables apply to most use cases and are less complex to set up.

Valid Values: `property` \| `pattern`

Type: String

Required: Yes

**inputType**

Determines how the dashboard user inputs the value for the variable.

- Specify `input` to use a text box that the user can enter values into.

- Specify `select` to use a dropdown set of values that you define, or a dropdown list of
values found by a metric search query.

- Specify `radio` to use a set of radio buttons, with values that you
define or that you find with a metric search query.

Valid Values: `input` \| `select` \| `radio`

Type: String

Required: Yes

**values**

If your `inputType` is `select` or `radio` and you want to define
the possible variable values instead of using a metric query search, specify those values here.

`values` is an array where each object in the array contains a required _value_
and an optional _label_. Each _value_ can be a string, number, or Boolean,
and each label must be a string. Each of these values and labels can be as many as 255 characters.

If you specify a `values` array it must include at least one item, and can include
as many as 500.

For example, the following creates a list of three possible Regions to use as the values for
a variable.

```json

"values": [
    { "label": "US East (IAD)", "value": "us-east-1" },
    { "label": "US West (SFO)", "value": "us-west-1" },
    { "label": "EU (DUB)", "value": "eu-west-1" }
]
```

Type: Array

Required: Yes if `inputType` is `select` or `radio` and you are
not using a metric search query to populate the values.

**id**

An Id for this variable. It can be up to 32 characters, and valid characters
are `0-9A-Za-z-_`

Type: String

Required: Yes

**label**

A label to display for the input field. It can have as many as 30 characters.

If you omit this field for a property variable,
the property name is displayed as the label. If you omit it for a pattern variable, then
`pattern_1, pattern_2, ...`
is used for the label.

Type: String

Required: No

**defaultValue**

The default value for the variable, when the dashboard is first opened.

- If `inputType` is `input`, you specify
the `defaultValue` here manually and use as many as 255 characters

- If `inputType` is `select` or `radio`, you must specify
a valid possible value that you specified in the `values` array or that was retrieved
in the metric query search.

Valid Values: Any valid value for this variable

Type: String, Number, or Boolean, depending on the type value for this variable

Required: No

**search**

Specify this field to populate your `select` or `radio` input field by using
a metric search expression. For the value for this field, specify a namespace, dimension name, and a metric
name. The dimension that you specify must be valid for that metric. CloudWatch finds all
resources that publish that metric and dimension, and populates the list
with them.

For example, specify `"search": "{AWS/EC2,InstanceId} MetricName=\"CPUUtilization\""` to
search for Amazon EC2 instances in the account, or specify `"search": "{AWS/Lambda,FunctionName} MetricName=\"Duration\"",`
to return the Lambda functions in the account

The `search` string that you specify can be as many as 2048 characters.

###### Note

If you're using a search expression and you also want to specify a default value,
the default that you specify in `defaultValue` is used as long as that default is one or the resources
that was retrieved by the search. When using a search expression to populate your input field,
you can also specify the special value `__FIRST` for `defaultValue`, to have
the default value be the first value returned from the search. (The special value includes two underscores
and then FIRST) Values returned by the search
are always sorted alphabetically.

Type: String

Required: Yes if `inputType` is `select` or `radio` and you are
not specifying `values`.

**populateFrom**

If you are using the `search` field to populate your input field by using a search expression,
specify this field with the name of a dimension that the search will retrieve.

For example, if your `search` value is
`"search": "{AWS/EC2,InstanceId} MetricName=\"CPUUtilization\""`, then you can specify
`InstanceId` for `populateFrom`.

Type: String

Required: Yes if `inputType` is `select` or `radio` and you are
not specifying `values`.

**visible**

Specified whether the input label and field are visible on the dashboard. If you omit this,
the default of `true` is used.

Using `false` saves some room on the dashboard, but requires the user to
change the dashboard URL to change the variable values.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

### Variable examples

The following example uses a property variable for changing the Region of all widgets, using a text
input field. When the dashboard is first opened, the default value of `us-east-1` is used
for the variable.

```json

"variables": [
     {
        "type": "property",
        "property": "region",
        "inputType": "input",
        "id": "region",
        "label": "Region",
        "defaultValue": "us-east-1",
        "visible": true
    }
],
```

The following example uses a pattern variable for changing the Region of all widgets, in the case
where sometimes the Region is set in the middle of a string such as an ARN.

```json

"variables": [
    {
        "type": "pattern",
        "pattern": "us-east-1",
        "inputType": "input",
        "id": "region",
        "label": "Region",
        "defaultValue": "us-east-1",
        "visible": true
    }
],
```

The following example generates a Lambda function variable, with a radio button for each function. Functions
are discovered by a metric query search.

```json

"variables": [
    {
        "type": "pattern",
        "pattern": "originalFuncNameInDashboard",
        "inputType": "radio",
        "id": "functionName",
        "label": "Function",
        "visible": true,
        "search": "{AWS/Lambda,FunctionName} MetricName=\"Duration\"",
        "populateFrom": "FunctionName",
        "defaultValue": "__FIRST"
    }
],
```

The following sample displays how to specify multiple variables in a dashboard, and demonstrates several
types of variables.

```json

"variables": [{
        "type": "property",
        "property": "region",
        "inputType": "select",
        "id": "unique_id_1",
        "label": "Region",
        "defaultValue": "us-east-1",
        "visible": true,
        "values": [{
                "label": "IAD",
                "value": "us-east-1"
            },
            {
                "label": "CMH",
                "value": "us-east-2"
            },
            {
                "label": "NRT",
                "value": "ap-northeast-1"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "type": "property",
        "property": "FunctionName",
        "inputType": "select",
        "id": "unique_id_2",
        "label": "Function",
        "visible": true,
        "values": [{
                "value": "my-FunctionName-1"
            },
            {
                "value": "my-FunctionName-2"
            },
            {
                "value": "my-FunctionName-3"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "type": "property",
        "property": "accountId",
        "inputType": "radio",
        "id": "unique_id_3",
        "defaultValue": "111122223333",
        "visible": true,
        "values": [{
                "label": "IAD Account",
                "value": "111122223333"
            },
            {
                "label": "CMH Account",
                "value": "123456789012"
            },
            {
                "label": "NRT Account",
                "value": "000000000000"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

### Properties of a Text Widget Object

A widget of type `text` can have one or two parameters in the `properties` section. The `markdown` field is required,
and the `transparent` field is optional.

For more information about the style of markdown supported in CloudWatch text widgets, see
[Using Markdown in the Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-markdown.html).

**markdown**

The text to be displayed by the widget. Use this parameter only for text widgets.

Type: String

Required: Yes (when the widget `type` is `text`).

**background**

Specifies whether the text widget has a solid or transparent background. The value `transparent` makes the widget transparent. The value `solid` is the default.

Type: String

Required: No

```

{
   "widgets":[
      {
         "type":"text",
         "x":0,
         "y":7,
         "width":3,
         "height":3,
         "properties":{
            "markdown":"Hello world",
            "background": "transparent"
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

## Properties of a Log Widget Object

A widget of type `log` represents the results of a CloudWatch Logs Insights query. For more information, see
[Analyzing Log Data with CloudWatch Logs Insights](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/analyzinglogdata.md).

A `log` widget can include the
following fields in its `properties` field.

**accountId**

The account ID of the AWS account containing the logs, if this is a cross-account query.

Type: String

Required: No

**region**

The Region of the logs query.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**title**

The title text to be displayed by the widget.

Type: String

Required: No

**query**

Contains the CloudWatch Logs Insights query function.

Type: String

Required: Yes (when the widget `type` is `log`).

The `query` string starts with the names of the log groups that are to be queried. You must pre-pend each
log group name with `SOURCE`. Separate
multiple log groups with a pipe character (\|).

Add another pipe character after the list of log groups, and then specify the query syntax. Separate each line in the query
syntax with `\n|`

For example, the following line represents a query of two log groups, `service_log1` and `service_log2`. The query
displays
canaries that have faults.

```

"query": "SOURCE 'service_log1' | SOURCE 'service_log2' |filter Fault > 0\n| fields Fault.Message\n| stats count(*) by Canary.Name, Fault.Message"
```

**view**

Specifies how the query results are displayed. Specify `table` to view the results as a table.
Specify `timeSeries` to display this metric as a line graph. Specify `bar` to
display it as a bar graph. Specify `pie` to display it as a pie graph.

If you omit this parameter, the results are displayed as a table.

Type: String

Required: No (when the widget `type` is `log`).

```

{
    "widgets": [
        {
            "type": "log",
            "x": 12,
            "y": 24,
            "width": 12,
            "height": 6,
            "properties": {
                "region": "us-east-1",

## Properties of a Metric Widget Object

A widget of type
`metric` can have the following fields within `properties`:

**accountId**

Specifies the AWS account ID where all metrics in this widget will come from. This is useful for cross-account dashboards
that include widgets from multiple accounts. For more information, see
[Cross-Account Cross-Region CloudWatch Console](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cross-account-cross-region.md).

If you omit this, the current account is used as the default. Use this
parameter only for metric widgets.

You can also use an `accountId` field within each metric in the array of `metrics` to create
a single widget which includes metrics from multiple accounts.

Type: String

Required: No

**annotations**

To include an alarm or annotation in the widget, specify an `annotations` array. For more
information about the format, see
[Dashboard Widget Object: Annotation Properties](#CloudWatch-Dashboard-Properties-Annotation-Format). Use this
parameter only for metric widgets.

Type: Object

Required: An alarm annotation is required only when the widget `type` is `metric` and `metrics` is not specified.
A horizontal or vertical annotation is not required.

**liveData**

Specify `true` to display _live data_ in the widget. Live
data is data published within the last minute that has not been fully aggregated. For more
information, see [Use Live Data](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-live-data.md).

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**legend**

Specify `legend` to determine where the legend for the lines
on the graph is displayed. The `legend` field contains another
field called `position`. Possible values for `position`
are `right`, `bottom`, and `hidden`.

For example, the following causes the legend to appear on the right
in the graph.

```

"legend": {
     "position": "right"
}
```

Type: Object

Required: No

**metrics**

Specify a `metrics` array to include one or more metrics (without alarms), a Metrics Insights
query, math expressions, or search expressions.
One `metrics` array can include
0–500 metrics and expressions. Use this parameter only for metric widgets. For more
information about the format of `metrics`, see [Metric Widget: Format for Each Metric in the Array](#CloudWatch-Dashboard-Properties-Metrics-Array-Format).

One metrics array can include no more than one Metrics Insights query.

A single `expression` field can't include both a Metrics Insights query and
a math expression, but you can use the returned results of a Metrics Insights query from one
expression as input in a math expression in a different expression in the array.

Type: Array of arrays

Required: Yes, when the widget `type` is `metric` and `annotations` is not specified.

**period**

The default period, in seconds, for all metrics in this widget. The period is the length of time represented by one
data point on the graph. This default can be overridden within each metric definition.
Use this parameter only for metric widgets. The default is 300.

Valid Values: Any multiple of 60, with 60 as the minimum.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**region**

The region of the metric.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**sparkline**

Specify `true`
to display the sparkline feature
under the number widget.
Specify `false`
to display the number widget
by itself.
This parameter is ignored
if view is not `singleValue`.
Use this parameter only for metric widgets.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**stacked**

Specify `true` to display the graph as a stacked line, or `false` to
display as separate lines. This parameter is ignored if `view` is `singleValue`. Use
this parameter only for metric widgets.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**stat**

The default statistic to be displayed for each metric
in the array. This
default can be overridden within the definition of each individual metric in
the `metrics` array. Use this parameter only for metric widgets.

Valid Values: `SampleCount` \| `Average` \| `Sum` \| `Minimum` \| `Maximum` \|
`p??`

Type: String that is a valid CloudWatch statistic.

Required: No

**table**

Include a `table` section to include data table-related changes in the widget. For more information about the
format, see [Dashboard Widget Object: Table Properties](#CloudWatch-Dashboard-Properties-Table).

Type: Object

Required: No

**timezone**

The time zone to use for displaying the times in the graph. The format is
\+ or - followed by four digits. The first two digits indicate the number of
hours ahead or behind of UTC, and the final two digits are the number of
minutes. For example, `+0130` indicates a time 1 hour and 30
minutes ahead of UTC. The default is `+0000`.

Type: String

Required: No

**title**

The title to be displayed for the graph or number. Use
this parameter only for metric widgets.

Type: String

Required: No

**view**

Specify `timeSeries`
to display this metric
as a line or stacked area graph.
Specify `singleValue`
to display this metric
as a number graph.
Specify `gauge`
to display this metric
as a gauge graph.
Specify `bar`
to display this metric
as a bar graph.
Specify `pie` to display this metric
as a pie graph.

###### Note

If you specify `gauge`,
you must set a value
for `min` and `max`
on the left side
of `yAxis`.

Valid Values: `timeSeries` \| `singleValue` \| `gauge` \| `bar` \| `pie` \| `table`

Type: String

Required: No

**yAxis**

The minimum and maximum values
for the left and right side
of a graph's Y-axis.
This property applies
to all graphed metrics,
except
for specific metrics
that override this setting.
For more information,
see [Dashboard Widget Object: yAxis Properties Format](#CloudWatch-Dashboard-Properties-YAxis-Properties-Format).

Type: yAxis object

Required: No

the `metrics` array, for each one after the first you may specify
only `"."` to use the same namespace as the previous metric in
the array.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**MetricName**

The name of the CloudWatch metric. If you have multiple entries in the
`metrics` array, for each one after the first you may specify
only `"."` to use the same metric name as the previous metric in
the array.

Type: String

Required: Yes, for a single metric

**expression**

The Metrics Insights query, math expression, or search expression, if this is an expression
instead of a single metric.

In a search expression using double-quotes for an exact match, each double-quote mark must be escaped with a backslash.

For more information about Metrics Insights query syntax,
see
[Metrics Insights query components and syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-metrics-insights-querylanguage.html).

```

**DimensionName**

The name of a dimension to further refine what data is shown. If you have
multiple entries in the `metrics` array, for each one after the
first you may specify only `"."` to use the same dimension name
as in the corresponding dimension specified in the previous metric in the
array. You may specify 0 dimensions for a metric, or up to as many
dimensions as the metric support.

Type: String

Required: No

**DimensionValue**

The value to use for that dimension for the metric. Required if there is a corresponding dimension name.

Type: String

Required: No

**region**

The region of the metric. Use this parameter only for metric widgets. If you omit this, the current Region is used
as the default.

Type: String

Required: No

**Rendering Properties Object**

Specifies rendering properties to be used for this particular metric, overriding the
values specified for the overall widget. For more
information about the format, see
[Dashboard Widget Object: Rendering Properties Object Format](#CloudWatch-Dashboard-Properties-Rendering-Object-Format).

Type: Metric Render Properties Object

Required: No

```nohighlight

// The simplest example, a metric with no dimensions
        [ "AWS/EC2", "CPUUtilization" ]

### Dashboard Widget Object: Rendering Properties Object Format

Each metric in the `metrics` array can optionally have custom rendering
properties that override the default rendering properties specified in the
`yAxis` parameter of the `widget` object. This section
describes the format for those per-metric custom rendering properties.

**color**

The six-digit HTML hex color code to be used for this metric.

Type: String

Required: No

**label**

The label to display for this metric in the graph legend. If this is
not specified, the metric is given an autogenerated label that
distinguishes it from the other metrics in the widget.

Type: String

Required: No

**period**

The period for this metric, in seconds. The period is the length of time represented by one
data point on the graph.

Valid Values: A multiple of 60, with a minimum of 60.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**stat**

The statistic for this metric, if it is to be different than the statistic used for the
other metrics in the array. By default CloudWatch uses _Average_ if you don't specify a statistic at array or at metric level.

Valid Values: `SampleCount` \| `Average` \| `Sum` \| `Minimum` \| `Maximum` \|
`p??`

Type: String that is a valid CloudWatch statistic.

Required: No

**visible**

Set this to `true` to have the metric appear in the graph, or `false` to have it be hidden. The default
is `true`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**yAxis**

Where on the graph to display the y-axis for this metric. The default is `left`.

Valid Values: `left` \| `right`

Type: String

Required: No

```

 // The third metric has its own rendering properties, overriding those of the rest of the widget.
        [ "AWS/EC2", "DiskReadBytes", "InstanceId", "i-xyz" ],
        [ ".", ".", ".", "i-abc" ],
        [ ".", ".", ".", "i-123", { "label":"Instance i-123", "yAxis": "right"}  ]
```

### Dashboard Widget Object: Annotation Properties

Annotations include alarms, horizontal annotations, and vertical annotations. A single metric widget can
have up to one alarm, or it can have one or more horizontal or vertical annotations. A single widget can't
have both an alarm and horizontal or vertical annotations.

#### Alarm Annotations

If you
specify an alarm annotation, you cannot also specify a `metrics` array in the same widget.

**alarms**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the alarm.

Type: Array of strings. There can be 0–1 strings in the
array.

Required: Only if no metrics are listed.

```nohighlight

"annotations": {
   "alarms": [ "arn1" ]
}

```

#### Horizontal Annotations

**horizontal**

An array of horizontal annotations. Horizontal annotations have several options for fill shading, including shading above the
annotation line, shading below the annotation line, and "band" shading that appears between two linked annotation lines
as part of a single band annotation. Each horizontal annotation in the array that is a single annotation, instead
of a band annotation, has the following format:

```nohighlight

{value, label, color, fill, yAxis, visible}
```

Each horizontal annotation that is a band annotation has the following format:

```nohighlight

[ {value, label, color, yAxis, visible}, {value, label} ]
```

**value**

The metric value in the graph where the horizontal annotation line is to appear. On a band shading annotation, the two values
for Value define the upper and lower edges of the band.

On a graph with horizontal annotations, the graph is scaled so that all visible horizontal annotations appear on the graph.

Type: Float

Required: Yes

**label**

A string that appears on the graph next to the annotation.

Type: String

Required: No

**color**

The six-digit HTML hex color code to be used for the annotation. This color is used for both the annotation line and the fill shading.

Type: String

Required: No

**fill**

How to use fill shading with the annotation. Valid values are
`above` for shading above the annotation,
`below` for shading below the annotation, and
`none` for no shading. If `fill` is
omitted, there is no shading.

The exception is an annotation with band shading. These annotations always have shading between the two values, and any value for `fill`
is ignored.

Type: String

Required: No

**visible**

Set this to `true` to have the annotation appear in the graph, or `false` to have it be hidden. The default
is `true`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**yAxis**

If the graph includes multiple metrics, specifies whether the numbers
in `Value` refer to the metric associated with the left
Y-axis or the right Y-axis, . Valid values are `right`
and `left`.

Type: String

Required: No

```

// A single horizontal annotation with fill shading above the annotation line, based on the metric associated with the right Y-axis

"annotations": {
     "horizontal": [
         {
              "visible":true,
              "color":"#9467bd",
              "label":"Critical range",
              "value":20,
              "fill":"above",
              "yAxis":"right"
         }
    ]
}

// A band annotation. Each value has a label, but other parameters for the band are specified only with the first number

"annotations": {
    "horizontal": [
        [
            {
                "label": "Band top",
                "value": 200,
                "color": "#9467bd",
                "visible": true,
                "yAxis": "right"
            },
            {
                "value": 95.5,
                "label": "Band bottom"
            }
        ]
    ]
}

// Three annotations on a graph. The first one is a band annotation. The final one is hidden.

"annotations": {
    "horizontal": [
        [
            {
                "label": "Band top",
                "value": 200,
                "color": "#9467bd",
                "visible": true,
                "yAxis": "right"
            },
            {
                "value": 95.5,
                "label": "Band bottom"
            }
        ],
        {
            "visible": true,
            "color": "#9467bd",
            "label": "Label for this annotation",
            "value": 20,
            "fill": "below",
            "yAxis": "right"
        },
        {
            "visible": false,
            "color": "#aaa",
            "label": "Hidden annotation",
            "value": 150
        }
    ]
}

```

#### Vertical Annotations

**vertical**

An array of vertical annotations. For each vertical annotation, you can choose to have fill shading before
the annotation, after it, or between two vertical lines that are linked as a
single band annotation. Each vertical annotation in the array that is a single annotation, instead
of a band annotation, has the following format:

```nohighlight

{value, label, color, fill, visible}
```

Each vertical annotation that is a band annotation has the following format:

```nohighlight

[ {value, label, color, visible}, {value, label} ]
```

**value**

The date and time in the graph where the vertical annotation line is to appear. On a band shading annotation, the two values
for Value define the beginning and ending edges of the band.

On a graph with vertical annotations, the graph is scaled so that all visible vertical annotations appear on the graph.

This is defined as a string in ISO 8601 format. For more information,
see [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

Type: String

Required: Yes

**label**

A string that appears on the graph next to the annotation.

Type: String

Required: No

**color**

The six-digit HTML hex color code to be used for the annotation. This color is used for both the annotation line and the fill shading.

Type: String

Required: No

**fill**

How to use fill shading with the annotation. Valid values are
`before` for shading before the annotation,
`after` for shading after the annotation, and
`none` for no shading. If `fill` is
omitted, there is no shading.

The exception is an annotation with band shading. These annotations always have shading between the two values, and any value for `fill`
is ignored.

Type: String

Required: No

**visible**

Set this to `true` to have the annotation appear in the graph, or `false` to have it be hidden. The default
is `true`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

```

// A single vertical annotation with fill shading after the annotation line

"annotations": {
    "vertical": [
        {
            "visible": true,
            "color": "#9467bd",
            "label": "Bug fix deployed",
            "value": "2018-08-28T15:25:26Z",
            "fill": "after"
        }
    ]
}

the maximum and minimum, a label for the axis, and whether the axis shows the units.
Set this
within the `widget` object to affect all metrics in the widget. To
override the widget settings for a particular metric, set it for the metric in the
`metrics` array.

```

{
  left: {
    min: 0,
    max: 100
  },
  right: {
    min: 0
  }
}

Each of the `left` and `right` objects can include the
following parameters:

**label**

A label for this Y-axis

Type: String

Required: No

**min**

The minimum value for this Y-axis

Type: Float

Required: No

**max**

The maximum value for this Y-axis

Type: Float

### Dashboard Widget Object: Table Properties

If you specify `table` for a metric widget, you can include visualisations related to the visibility of summary columns, datapoint columns, and the table layout.
These properties take affect only when the widget view type is `table` and don't alter other view types if included. The `table` property is not required to use a table widget.

**layout**

Use this field to transform the table such that the data points extend vertically or horizontally. The default is `horizontal`.

Valid Values: `vertical` \| `horizontal`

Type: String

Required: No

**stickySummary**

Set this to `true` to make the summary columns that you include in the table sticky, so you can explore the data
columns while always having the summary columns in your viewport. The default is `false`.

The widget label is always sticky, no matter your choice in this field.

Valid Values: `true` \| `false`

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**showTimeSeriesData**

Set this to `false` if you want only the label and summary columns to be displayed, hiding the other columns of data.

The default is `true`.

Valid Values: `true` \| `false`

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**summaryColumns**

Summary columns are a new property introduced with the table widget. These columns are a specific subset of summaries of your current table. For example, the
`Sum` summary is a sum of all the rendered datapoints in its respective row. Summary columns are not that same concept as any CloudWatch metric statistic.

The default is `[“MIN“, "MAX","SUM", "AVG"]`

Valid Values: `"MIN"` \| `"MAX"` \| `"SUM"` \| `"AVG"`

Type: Array

Required: No

For example, the following JSON creates a table displaying the minimum and maximum of each metric in the table.

```JSON

"table": {
    "summaryColumns": ["MIN", "MAX"],
    "layout": "vertical",
    "stickySummary": true,
    "showTimeSeriesData": false,
    },
```

## Properties of a Metrics Explorer Widget Object

A widget of type
`explorer` represents a metrics explorer widget. For more information,
see [Use Metrics Explorer to Monitor Resources by Their \
Tags and Properties](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Metrics-Explorer.html)

You can also add metrics explorer widgets to a dashboard using CloudFormation. For
more information, see [AWS::CloudWatch::Dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cloudwatch-dashboard.html).

This widget type can have the following fields within the widget `properties`:

**aggregateBy**

An object that specifies how to aggregate metrics from multiple resources. The valid values
for the `key` field in this object are
the keys of tags and resource properties. This object contains
the following fields.

- **key**– The
tag or resource property key to use for aggregating the metrics.

- **func**– The
aggregation function to use. Valid values are
`AVG` \|
`MIN` \|
`MAX` \|
`STDDEV` \|
`SUM`

Type: Object

Required: No

**labels**

An array of the tags or the resource properties that are used to determine
which metrics are displayed in the widget.

If you specify different keys, then only the resources that match all of
the key/value pairs are displayed. If you specify multiple values for a single key,
then resources that match any of the values for that key are displayed.

- **key**– The
tag or resource property to filter on.

For `key`, all tag keys are valid to be specified. The following
EC2 and Lambda resource properties are also valid for `key`:

- EC2:

`Architecture`, `Hypervisor`,
`CoreCount`,
`ImageId`,
`InstanceId`,
`InstanceLifecycle`,
`InstanceType`,
`InstanceFamily`,
`InstanceSize`,
`Affinity`,
`AvailabilityZone`,
`Tenancy`, `Platform`, `RootDeviceType
                                              SecurityGroups,
                                              State,
                                              SubnetId,
                                              VirtualizationType, and
                                              VpcId `

- Lambda:

`FunctionName`,
`Runtime`,
`Language`,
`MemorySize`,
`Version`,
`SecurityGroupIds`,
`SubnetIds`,
`SubnetIdCount`,
`VpcId`, and
`Timeout`

- **value**– (Optional) The
value of the tag or resource property to filter on. If this is omitted,
metrics corresponding to all values of that tag or resource property are displayed.

Type: Object

Required: Yes

**metrics**

Specify a `metrics` array to include one or more metrics.
One `metrics` array can include
1–100 metrics. Each object in the array must contain the following fields.

- **metricName**– The
name of the metric.

- **resourceType**– The
type of resource publishing the metric, described in the format
used by AWS CloudFormation. For example, `AWS::EC2::Instance`
or `AWS::Lambda::Function`.

You must use the same value for `resourceType`
for all metrics in the widget.

For a complete list of valid values, see
[Valid resourceType Values for a Metric Explorer Widget Object](#CloudWatch-Dashboard-Properties-Metric-Explorer-resourceType).

- **stat**– The statistic for this metric, if it is to be different than the statistic used for the
other metrics in the array. By default CloudWatch uses _Average_ if you don't specify a statistic at array or at metric level.

Valid Values: `SampleCount` \| `Average` \| `Sum` \| `Minimum` \| `Maximum` \|
`p??`

Type: Array of objects

Required: Yes

**period**

The default period, in seconds, for all metrics in this widget. The period is the length of time represented by one
data point on the graph. The default is 300.

Valid Values: Any multiple of 60, with 60 as the minimum.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**splitBy**

Specifies how to split the metrics from multiple resources into
different lines on a graph, or into different graphs. The valid values are
the keys of tags, and the keys of resource properties.

Type: String

Required: No

**title**

The title to be displayed for the widget. The default is `Explorer`.

Type: String

Required: No

**widgetOptions**

An object that specifies how the widget appears on the dashboard. It can
contain the following fields.

- **legend**–

Determines where the legend for each graph is displayed.
The `legend` field contains another
field called `position`. Possible values for `position`
are `right`, `bottom`, and `hidden`.

For example, the following causes the legend to appear on the right
in the graph.

```

"legend": {
       "position": "right"
}
```

- **rowsPerPage**–

Specifies how many rows of graphs are displayed per page in the widget.

- **stacked**–

Specify
`true` to display the graph as a stacked area chart, or `false` to
display as separate lines.

- **view**–

Specifies how each graph is displayed.
Specify `timeSeries` to display this metric as a line graph.
Specify `bar` to
display it as a bar graph.
Specify `pie` to display it as a pie graph. The default
is `timeSeries`.

- **widgetsPerRow**–

Specifies how many graphs are displayed in each row
of the metrics explorer widget.

Type: Object

Required: No

**Example**

The following example displays three metrics for each of the account's running EC2 instances, with the
graphs in the widget split by availability zone. Within each graph, the metrics are aggregated
by instance type.

## Properties of an Alarm Status Widget Object

A widget of type `alarm` can have the following
fields within `properties`.

**alarms**

An array of alarm ARNs to include in the widget. The array
can have 1-100 ARNs.

Type: Array of strings

Required: Yes (when the widget `type` is `alarm`).

**sortBy**

Specifies how to sort the alarms in the widget.

Choose `default`
to sort them in alphabetical order by alarm name.

Choose `stateUpdatedTimestamp`
to sort them first by alarm state, with alarms in ALARM state first, INSUFFICIENT\_DATA
alarms next, and OK alarms last. Within each group, the alarms are sorted by
when they last changed state, with more recent state changes listed first.

Choose `timestamp`
to sort them by the time when the alarms most recently changed state, no matter the
current alarm state. The alarm that changed state most
recently is listed first.

If you omit this field, the alarms are sorted in alphabetical order.

Type: String

Valid Values: default \| stateUpdatedTimestamp \| timestamp

Required: No

**states**

Use this field to filter the list of alarms displayed in the widget to only
those alarms currently in the specified states. You can specify one or more alarm states
in the value for this field. The alarm states that you can specify are
`ALARM`, `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`, and `OK`.

If you omit this field or specify an empty array, all the alarms
specifed in `alarms` are displayed.

Type: Array of strings

Required: No

**title**

The title text to be displayed by the widget.

Type: String

Required: No

The following example is an alarm status widget that displays four alarms specified by
name, no matter their current state:

```

{
    "type": "alarm",
    "x": 0,
    "y": 0,
    "width": 12,
    "height": 6,
    "properties": {
        "alarms": [
            "arn:aws:cloudwatch:us-east-1:012345678901:alarm:EC2FrontendCPU",
            "arn:aws:cloudwatch:us-east-1:012345678901:alarm:EC2BackendCPU",
            "arn:aws:cloudwatch:eu-west-1:987654321098:alarm:EC2FrontendCPU",
            "arn:aws:cloudwatch:eu-west-1:987654321098:alarm:EC2BackendCPU"
        ],
        "sortBy": "stateUpdatedTimestamp",
        "title": "All EC2 CPU alarms"
    }
}
```

The following example widget specifies the same four alarms, but the widget
displays only the alarms that are
currently in ALARM or INSUFFICIENT\_DATA state:

```

{
    "type": "alarm",
    "x": 0,
    "y": 0,
    "width": 12,
    "height": 6,
    "properties": {
        "alarms": [
            "arn:aws:cloudwatch:us-east-1:012345678901:alarm:EC2FrontendCPU",
            "arn:aws:cloudwatch:us-east-1:012345678901:alarm:EC2BackendCPU",
            "arn:aws:cloudwatch:eu-west-1:987654321098:alarm:EC2FrontendCPU",
            "arn:aws:cloudwatch:eu-west-1:987654321098:alarm:EC2BackendCPU"
        ],
        "sortBy": "stateUpdatedTimestamp",
        "states": [
            "ALARM",
            "INSUFFICIENT_DATA"
        ],
        "title": "EC2 alarms that are not currently OK"
    }
}
```
