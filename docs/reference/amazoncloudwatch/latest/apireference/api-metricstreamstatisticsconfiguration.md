# MetricStreamStatisticsConfiguration

By default, a metric stream always sends the `MAX`, `MIN`,
`SUM`, and `SAMPLECOUNT` statistics for each metric that is
streamed. This structure contains information for one metric that includes additional
statistics in the stream. For more information about statistics, see CloudWatch,
listed in [CloudWatch statistics definitions](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/statistics-definitions.md).

## Contents

**AdditionalStatistics**

The list of additional statistics that are to be streamed for the metrics listed in
the `IncludeMetrics` array in this structure. This list can include as many
as 20 statistics.

If the `OutputFormat` for the stream is `opentelemetry1.0` or
`opentelemetry0.7`, the only valid values are
`p??
                  ` percentile statistics such as
`p90`, `p99` and so on.

If the `OutputFormat` for the stream is `json`, the valid values
include the abbreviations for all of the statistics listed in [CloudWatch statistics definitions](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/statistics-definitions.md). For example, this includes
`tm98, ` `wm90`, `PR(:300)`, and so on.

Type: Array of strings

Required: Yes

**IncludeMetrics**

An array of metric name and namespace pairs that stream the additional statistics
listed in the value of the `AdditionalStatistics` parameter. There can be as
many as 100 pairs in the array.

All metrics that match the combination of metric name and namespace will be streamed
with the additional statistics, no matter their dimensions.

Type: Array of [MetricStreamStatisticsMetric](api-metricstreamstatisticsmetric.md) objects

Required: Yes
