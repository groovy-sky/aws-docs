# MetricCharacteristics

This object includes parameters that you can use to provide information to CloudWatch to help it build more accurate anomaly detection models.

## Contents

**PeriodicSpikes**

Set this parameter to `true` if values for this metric consistently include
spikes that should not be considered to be anomalies. With this set to
`true`, CloudWatch will expect to see spikes that occurred
consistently during the model training period, and won't flag future similar spikes as
anomalies.
