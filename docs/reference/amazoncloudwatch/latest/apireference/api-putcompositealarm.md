# PutCompositeAlarm

Creates or updates a _composite alarm_. When you create a composite
alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into account the alarm
states of other alarms that you have created. The composite alarm goes into ALARM state
only if all conditions of the rule are met.

The alarms specified in a composite alarm's rule expression can include metric alarms
and other composite alarms. The rule expression of a composite alarm can include as many
as 100 underlying alarms. Any single alarm can be included in the rule expressions of as
many as 150 composite alarms.

Using composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple metric alarms,
and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only for the composite alarm. For
example, you could create a composite alarm that goes into ALARM state only when more
than one of the underlying metric alarms are in ALARM state.

Composite alarms can take the following actions:

- Notify Amazon SNS topics.

- Invoke Lambda functions.

- Create OpsItems in Systems Manager Ops Center.

- Create incidents in Systems Manager Incident Manager.

###### Note

It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite
alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on
composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that is
part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on
that alarm that you want to delete.

To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of
one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the
cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to change the
`AlarmRule` of one of the alarms to `false`.

Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch detects a
cycle in the evaluation path.

When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to
`INSUFFICIENT_DATA`. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set
appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed. For a
composite alarm, this initial time after creation is the only time that the alarm can be
in `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state.

When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update
completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.

To use this operation, you must be signed on with the
`cloudwatch:PutCompositeAlarm` permission that is scoped to
`*`. You can't create a composite alarms if your
`cloudwatch:PutCompositeAlarm` permission has a narrower scope.

If you are an IAM user, you must have
`iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` to create a composite alarm that has
Systems Manager OpsItem actions.

## Request Parameters

**ActionsEnabled**

Indicates whether actions should be executed during any changes to the alarm state of
the composite alarm. The default is `TRUE`.

Type: Boolean

Actions will be suppressed if the suppressor alarm is in the `ALARM`
state. `ActionsSuppressor` can be an AlarmName or an Amazon Resource Name
(ARN) from an existing alarm.

Type: String

`ExtensionPeriod` is required only when `ActionsSuppressor` is
specified.

Required: No

**ActionsSuppressorWaitPeriod**

The maximum time in seconds that the composite alarm waits for the suppressor alarm
to go into the `ALARM` state. After this time, the composite alarm performs
its actions.

###### Important

`WaitPeriod` is required only when `ActionsSuppressor` is
specified.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**AlarmActions**

The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the `ALARM` state
from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name
(ARN).

Valid Values: \]

**Amazon SNS actions:**

`arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:sns-topic-name
                  `

**Lambda actions:**

`arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:function-name
                          `

- Invoke a specific version of a Lambda function:
`arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:function-name:version-number
                          `

Required: No

**AlarmDescription**

The description for the composite alarm.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 1024.

Required: No

**AlarmName**

The name for the composite alarm. This name must be unique within the
Region.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 255.

Required: Yes

**AlarmRule**

An expression that specifies which other alarms are to be evaluated to determine this
composite alarm's state. For each alarm that you reference, you designate a function
that specifies whether that alarm needs to be in ALARM state, OK state, or
INSUFFICIENT\_DATA state. You can use operators (AND, OR and NOT) to combine multiple
functions in a single expression. You can use parenthesis to logically group the
functions in your expression.

You can use either alarm names or ARNs to reference the other alarms that are to be
evaluated.

Functions can include the following:

- `ALARM("alarm-name or
                      alarm-ARN")` is TRUE if the named alarm is in
ALARM state.

- `OK("alarm-name or
                      alarm-ARN")` is TRUE if the named alarm is in OK
state.

- `INSUFFICIENT_DATA("alarm-name or
                      alarm-ARN")` is TRUE if the named alarm is in
INSUFFICIENT\_DATA state.

- `TRUE` always evaluates to TRUE.

- `FALSE` always evaluates to FALSE.

TRUE and FALSE are useful for testing a complex `AlarmRule` structure, and
for testing your alarm actions.

Alarm names specified in `AlarmRule` can be surrounded with double-quotes
("), but do not have to be.

The following are some examples of `AlarmRule`:

- `ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh)`
specifies that the composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if both
CPUUtilizationTooHigh and DiskReadOpsTooHigh alarms are in ALARM state.

- `ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND NOT ALARM(DeploymentInProgress)`
specifies that the alarm goes to ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh is in
ALARM state and DeploymentInProgress is not in ALARM state. This example reduces
alarm noise during a known deployment window.

- `(ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) OR ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh)) AND
                      OK(NetworkOutTooHigh)` goes into ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh
OR DiskReadOpsTooHigh is in ALARM state, and if NetworkOutTooHigh is in OK
state. This provides another example of using a composite alarm to prevent
noise. This rule ensures that you are not notified with an alarm action on high
CPU or disk usage if a known network problem is also occurring.

The `AlarmRule` can specify as many as 100 "children" alarms. The
`AlarmRule` expression can have as many as 500 elements. Elements are
child alarms, TRUE or FALSE statements, and parentheses.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 10240.

Required: Yes

Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to
scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources
with certain tag values.

this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of an existing alarm, use [TagResource](api-tagresource.md) or [UntagResource](api-untagresource.md).
