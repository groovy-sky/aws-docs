## Response Elements
<a name="API_DescribeBackupJob_ResponseElements"></a>

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

 ** [AccountId](#API_DescribeBackupJob_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeBackupJob-response-AccountId"></a>
Returns the account ID that owns the backup job.
Type: String
Pattern: `^[0-9]{12}$`

 ** [BackupJobId](#API_DescribeBackupJob_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeBackupJob-response-BackupJobId"></a>
Uniquely identifies a request to AWS Backup to back up a resource.
Type: String

 ** [BackupOptions](#API_DescribeBackupJob_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeBackupJob-response-BackupOptions"></a>
Represents the options specified as part of backup plan or on-demand backup job.
Type: String to string map
Key Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.]{1,50}$`
Value Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.]{1,50}$`

 ** [BackupSizeInBytes](#API_DescribeBackupJob_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeBackupJob-response-BackupSizeInBytes"></a>
The size, in bytes, of a backup (recovery point).
This value can render differently depending on the resource type as AWS Backup pulls in data information from other AWS services. For example, the value returned may show a value of `0`, which may differ from the anticipated value.
The expected behavior for values by resource type are described as follows:
+ Amazon Aurora, Amazon DocumentDB, and Amazon Neptune do not have this value populate from the operation `GetBackupJobStatus`.
+ For Amazon DynamoDB with advanced features, this value refers to the size of the recovery point (backup).
+ Amazon EC2 and Amazon EBS show volume size (provisioned storage) returned as part of this value. Amazon EBS does not return backup size information; snapshot size will have the same value as the original resource that was backed up.
+ For Amazon EFS, this value refers to the delta bytes transferred during a backup.
+ For Amazon EKS, this value refers to the size of your nested EKS recovery point.
+ Amazon FSx does not populate this value from the operation `GetBackupJobStatus` for FSx file systems.
+ An Amazon RDS instance will show as `0`.
+ For virtual machines running VMware, this value is passed to AWS Backup through an asynchronous workflow, which can mean this displayed value can under-represent the actual backup size.
Type: Long

 ** [BackupType](#API_DescribeBackupJob_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeBackupJob-response-BackupType"></a>
Represents the actual backup type selected for a backup job. For example, if a successful Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) backup was taken, `BackupType` returns `"WindowsVSS"`. If `BackupType` is empty, then the backup type was a regular backup.

 ** [ExpectedCompletionDate](#API_DescribeBackupJob_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeBackupJob-response-ExpectedCompletionDate"></a>
The date and time that a job to back up resources is expected to be completed, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of `ExpectedCompletionDate` is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

Type: String

 ** [InitiationDate](#API_DescribeBackupJob_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeBackupJob-response-InitiationDate"></a>
The date a backup job was initiated.
Type: Timestamp

 ** [IsEncrypted](#API_DescribeBackupJob_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeBackupJob-response-IsEncrypted"></a>

Type: String

 ** [RecoveryPointLifecycle](#API_DescribeBackupJob_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeBackupJob-response-RecoveryPointLifecycle"></a>
Specifies the time period, in days, before a recovery point transitions to cold storage or is deleted.
Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, on the console, the retention setting must be 90 days greater than the transition to cold after days setting. The transition to cold after days setting can't be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.
Resource types that can transition to cold storage are listed in the [Feature availability by resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-feature-availability.html#features-by-resource) table. AWS Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.
To remove the existing lifecycle and retention periods and keep your recovery points indefinitely, specify -1 for `MoveToColdStorageAfterDays` and `DeleteAfterDays`.
Type: [Lifecycle](API_Lifecycle.md) object

 ** [ResourceArn](#API_DescribeBackupJob_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeBackupJob-response-ResourceArn"></a>

Type: String

 ** [ResourceName](#API_DescribeBackupJob_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeBackupJob-response-ResourceName"></a>
The non-unique name of the resource that belongs to the specified backup.
Type: String

 ** [ResourceType](#API_DescribeBackupJob_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeBackupJob-response-ResourceType"></a>
The type of AWS resource to be backed up; for example, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database.
Type: String
Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.]{1,50}$`

 ** [StartBy](#API_DescribeBackupJob_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeBackupJob-response-StartBy"></a>
Specifies the time in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when a backup job must be started before it is canceled. The value is calculated by adding the start window to the scheduled time. So if the scheduled time were 6:00 PM and the start window is 2 hours, the `StartBy` time would be 8:00 PM on the date specified. The value of `StartBy` is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
Type: Timestamp
