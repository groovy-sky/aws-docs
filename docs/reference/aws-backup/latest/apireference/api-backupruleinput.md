## Contents
<a name="API_BackupRuleInput_Contents"></a>

 ** RuleName **   <a name="Backup-Type-BackupRuleInput-RuleName"></a>
A display name for a backup rule. Must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric or '-\_.' characters.
Type: String
Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.]{1,50}$`
Required: Yes

 ** TargetBackupVaultName **   <a name="Backup-Type-BackupRuleInput-TargetBackupVaultName"></a>
The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the AWS Region where they are created.
Type: String
Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_]{2,50}$`
Required: Yes

 ** CompletionWindowMinutes **   <a name="Backup-Type-BackupRuleInput-CompletionWindowMinutes"></a>
A value in minutes after a backup job is successfully started before it must be completed or it will be canceled by AWS Backup. This value is optional.
Type: Long
Required: No

 ** CopyActions **   <a name="Backup-Type-BackupRuleInput-CopyActions"></a>
An array of `CopyAction` objects, which contains the details of the copy operation.
Type: Array of [CopyAction](API_CopyAction.md) objects
Required: No

 ** EnableContinuousBackup **   <a name="Backup-Type-BackupRuleInput-EnableContinuousBackup"></a>
Specifies whether AWS Backup creates continuous backups. True causes AWS Backup to create continuous backups capable of point-in-time restore (PITR). False (or not specified) causes AWS Backup to create snapshot backups.
Type: Boolean
Required: No

 ** IndexActions **   <a name="Backup-Type-BackupRuleInput-IndexActions"></a>
There can up to one IndexAction in each BackupRule, as each backup can have 0 or 1 backup index associated with it.
Within the array is ResourceTypes. Only 1 resource type will be accepted for each BackupRule. Valid values:
+  `EBS` for Amazon Elastic Block Store
+  `S3` for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
Type: Array of [IndexAction](API_IndexAction.md) objects
Required: No

 ** Lifecycle **   <a name="Backup-Type-BackupRuleInput-Lifecycle"></a>
The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and when it expires. AWS Backup will transition and expire backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.
Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “retention” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold storage.
Resource types that can transition to cold storage are listed in the [Feature availability by resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-feature-availability.html#features-by-resource) table. AWS Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.
This parameter has a maximum value of 100 years (36,500 days).
Type: [Lifecycle](API_Lifecycle.md) object
Required: No

 ** RecoveryPointTags **   <a name="Backup-Type-BackupRuleInput-RecoveryPointTags"></a>
The tags to assign to the resources.
Type: String to string map
Required: No

 ** ScanActions **   <a name="Backup-Type-BackupRuleInput-ScanActions"></a>
Contains your scanning configuration for the backup rule and includes the malware scanner, and scan mode of either full or incremental.
Type: Array of [ScanAction](API_ScanAction.md) objects
Required: No

 ** ScheduleExpression **   <a name="Backup-Type-BackupRuleInput-ScheduleExpression"></a>
A CRON expression in UTC specifying when AWS Backup initiates a backup job. When no CRON expression is provided, AWS Backup will use the default expression `cron(0 5 ? * * *)`.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ScheduleExpressionTimezone **   <a name="Backup-Type-BackupRuleInput-ScheduleExpressionTimezone"></a>
The timezone in which the schedule expression is set. By default, ScheduleExpressions are in UTC. You can modify this to a specified timezone.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** StartWindowMinutes **   <a name="Backup-Type-BackupRuleInput-StartWindowMinutes"></a>
A value in minutes after a backup is scheduled before a job will be canceled if it doesn't start successfully. This value is optional. If this value is included, it must be at least 60 minutes to avoid errors.
This parameter has a maximum value of 100 years (52,560,000 minutes).
During the start window, the backup job status remains in `CREATED` status until it has successfully begun or until the start window time has run out. If within the start window time AWS Backup receives an error that allows the job to be retried, AWS Backup will automatically retry to begin the job at least every 10 minutes until the backup successfully begins (the job status changes to `RUNNING`) or until the job status changes to `EXPIRED` (which is expected to occur when the start window time is over).
Type: Long
Required: No

 ** TargetLogicallyAirGappedBackupVaultArn **   <a name="Backup-Type-BackupRuleInput-TargetLogicallyAirGappedBackupVaultArn"></a>
The ARN of a logically air-gapped vault. ARN must be in the same account and Region. If provided, supported fully managed resources back up directly to logically air-gapped vault, while other supported resources create a temporary (billable) snapshot in backup vault, then copy it to logically air-gapped vault. Unsupported resources only back up to the specified backup vault.
Type: String
Required: No
