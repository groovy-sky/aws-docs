 ** [Lifecycle](#API_DescribeRecoveryPoint_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeRecoveryPoint-response-Lifecycle"></a>
The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and when it expires. AWS Backup transitions and expires backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.
Backups that are transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “retention” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.
Resource types that can transition to cold storage are listed in the [Feature availability by resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-feature-availability.html#features-by-resource) table. AWS Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.

Type: String

 ** [RecoveryPointArn](#API_DescribeRecoveryPoint_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeRecoveryPoint-response-RecoveryPointArn"></a>

The type of AWS resource to save as a recovery point; for example, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database.
Type: String
Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.]{1,50}$`

 ** [ScanResults](#API_DescribeRecoveryPoint_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeRecoveryPoint-response-ScanResults"></a>

Type: Array of [ScanResult](API_ScanResult.md) objects
Array Members: Minimum number of 0 items. Maximum number of 5 items.

 ** [SourceBackupVaultArn](#API_DescribeRecoveryPoint_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeRecoveryPoint-response-SourceBackupVaultArn"></a>
An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the source vault where the resource was originally backed up in; for example, `arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:backup-vault:aBackupVault`. If the recovery is restored to the same AWS account or Region, this value will be `null`.
Type: String

 ** [Status](#API_DescribeRecoveryPoint_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeRecoveryPoint-response-Status"></a>
A status code specifying the state of the recovery point. For more information, see [ Recovery point status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/applicationstackbackups.html#cfnrecoverypointstatus) in the * AWS Backup Developer Guide*.
+  `CREATING` status indicates that an AWS Backup job has been initiated for a resource. The backup process has started and is actively processing a backup job for the associated recovery point.
+  `AVAILABLE` status indicates that the backup was successfully created for the recovery point. The backup process has completed without any issues, and the recovery point is now ready for use.
+  `PARTIAL` status indicates a composite recovery point has one or more nested recovery points that were not in the backup.
+  `EXPIRED` status indicates that the recovery point has exceeded its retention period, but AWS Backup lacks permission or is otherwise unable to delete it. To manually delete these recovery points, see [ Step 3: Delete the recovery points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/gs-cleanup-resources.html#cleanup-backups) in the *Clean up resources* section of *Getting started*.
+  `STOPPED` status occurs on a continuous backup where a user has taken some action that causes the continuous backup to be disabled. This can be caused by the removal of permissions, turning off versioning, turning off events being sent to EventBridge, or disabling the EventBridge rules that are put in place by AWS Backup. For recovery points of Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and Amazon Aurora resources, this status occurs when the retention period of a continuous backup rule is changed.

  To resolve `STOPPED` status, ensure that all requested permissions are in place and that versioning is enabled on the S3 bucket. Once these conditions are met, the next instance of a backup rule running will result in a new continuous recovery point being created. The recovery points with STOPPED status do not need to be deleted.

  For SAP HANA on Amazon EC2 `STOPPED` status occurs due to user action, application misconfiguration, or backup failure. To ensure that future continuous backups succeed, refer to the recovery point status and check SAP HANA for details.
Type: String
Valid Values: `COMPLETED | PARTIAL | DELETING | EXPIRED | AVAILABLE | STOPPED | CREATING`

 ** [StatusMessage](#API_DescribeRecoveryPoint_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeRecoveryPoint-response-StatusMessage"></a>
A status message explaining the status of the recovery point.
Type: String

 ** [StorageClass](#API_DescribeRecoveryPoint_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeRecoveryPoint-response-StorageClass"></a>
Specifies the storage class of the recovery point. Valid values are `WARM` or `COLD`.
Type: String
Valid Values: `WARM | COLD | DELETED`

 ** [VaultType](#API_DescribeRecoveryPoint_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="Backup-DescribeRecoveryPoint-response-VaultType"></a>
The type of vault in which the described recovery point is stored.
Type: String
Valid Values: `BACKUP_VAULT | LOGICALLY_AIR_GAPPED_BACKUP_VAULT | RESTORE_ACCESS_BACKUP_VAULT`
