<a name="API_ListAccessPointsMember"></a>

Contains metadata about a backup access point.

## Contents
<a name="API_ListAccessPointsMember_Contents"></a>

 ** AccessPointArn **   <a name="Backup-Type-ListAccessPointsMember-AccessPointArn"></a>
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the backup access point.
Type: String
Pattern: `(arn:aws[a-z-]*:backup:[a-z-\d]+:\d{12}:accesspoint/)[\da-z]{1}[\da-z-]{1,48}[\da-z]{1}(?<!-s3alias)(?<!-ext-s3alias)`
Required: Yes

 ** AccessPointMetadata **   <a name="Backup-Type-ListAccessPointsMember-AccessPointMetadata"></a>
Metadata for the backup access point. After the backup access point reaches the `AVAILABLE` status, this map contains `S3AccessPointArn` and `S3AccessPointAlias`, which you use with standard Amazon S3 read APIs to access the backup data. For continuous recovery points, this map also contains `AccessPointInTime` (in format `2021-11-27T03:30:27Z`). The access point provides access to the content present in the backup at that specific time.
