# CreateExportTask

Creates an export task so that you can efficiently export data from a log group to an
Amazon S3 bucket. When you perform a `CreateExportTask` operation, you must use
credentials that have permission to write to the S3 bucket that you specify as the
destination.

Exporting log data to S3 buckets that are encrypted by AWS KMS is supported.
Exporting log data to Amazon S3 buckets that have S3 Object Lock enabled with a
retention period is also supported.

Exporting to S3 buckets that are encrypted with AES-256 is supported.

This is an asynchronous call. If all the required information is provided, this
operation initiates an export task and responds with the ID of the task. After the task has
started, you can use [DescribeExportTasks](api-describeexporttasks.md) to get the status of the export task. Each account can only
have one active ( `RUNNING` or `PENDING`) export task at a time. To
cancel an export task, use [CancelExportTask](api-cancelexporttask.md).

You can export logs from multiple log groups or multiple time ranges to the same S3
bucket. To separate log data for each export task, specify a prefix to be used as the Amazon
S3 key prefix for all exported objects.

###### Note

We recommend that you don't regularly export to Amazon S3 as a way to
continuously archive your logs. For that use case, we instead recommend that you use
subscriptions. For more information about subscriptions, see [Real-time processing of log data\
with subscriptions](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/subscriptions.md).

###### Note

Time-based sorting on chunks of log data inside an exported file is not guaranteed. You
can sort the exported log field data by using Linux utilities.

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[destination](#API_CreateExportTask_RequestSyntax)**

The name of S3 bucket for the exported log data. The bucket must be in the same AWS Region.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 512.

Required: Yes

**[destinationPrefix](#API_CreateExportTask_RequestSyntax)**

The prefix used as the start of the key for every object exported. If you don't specify
a value, the default is `exportedlogs`.

The length of this parameter must comply with the S3 object key name length limits. The
object key name is a sequence of Unicode characters with UTF-8 encoding, and can be up to
1,024 bytes.

Type: String

Required: No

**[from](#API_CreateExportTask_RequestSyntax)**

The start time of the range for the request, expressed as the number of milliseconds
after `Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC`. Events with a timestamp earlier than this time
are not exported.

Type: Long

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.

Required: Yes

**[logGroupName](#API_CreateExportTask_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the log group.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 512.

Pattern: `[\.\-_/#A-Za-z0-9]+`

Required: Yes

**[logStreamNamePrefix](#API_CreateExportTask_RequestSyntax)**

Export only log streams that match the provided prefix. If you don't specify a value,
no prefix filter is applied.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 512.

Pattern: `[^:*]*`

Required: No

**[taskName](#API_CreateExportTask_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the export task.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 512.

Required: No

**[to](#API_CreateExportTask_RequestSyntax)**

The end time of the range for the request, expressed as the number of milliseconds
after `Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC`. Events with a timestamp later than this time are
not exported.

You must specify a time that is not earlier than when this log group was created.

Type: Long

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.

Required: Yes

## Response Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "taskId": "string"
}
```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[taskId](#API_CreateExportTask_ResponseSyntax)**

The ID of the export task.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 512.

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**InvalidParameterException**

A parameter is specified incorrectly.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**LimitExceededException**

You have reached the maximum number of resources that can be created.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**OperationAbortedException**

Multiple concurrent requests to update the same resource were in conflict.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ResourceAlreadyExistsException**

The specified resource already exists.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ResourceNotFoundException**

The specified resource does not exist.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ServiceUnavailableException**

The service cannot complete the request.

HTTP Status Code: 500
