# StartQuery

Starts a query of one or more log groups or data sources using CloudWatch Logs
Insights. You specify the log groups or data sources and time range to query and the query
string to use. You can query up to 10 data sources in a single query.

For more information, see [CloudWatch Logs Insights Query\
Syntax](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/cwl-querysyntax.md).

After you run a query using `StartQuery`, the query results are stored by
CloudWatch Logs. You can use [GetQueryResults](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_GetQueryResults.html) to retrieve the results of a query, using the `queryId`
that `StartQuery` returns.

Interactive queries started with `StartQuery` share concurrency limits with
automated scheduled query executions. Both types of queries count toward the same regional
concurrent query quota, so high scheduled query activity may affect the availability of
concurrent slots for interactive queries.

###### Note

To specify the log groups to query, a `StartQuery` operation must include one
of the following:

- Either exactly one of the following parameters: `logGroupName`,
`logGroupNames`, or `logGroupIdentifiers`

- Or the `queryString` must include a `SOURCE` command to select
log groups for the query. The `SOURCE` command can select log groups based on
log group name prefix, account ID, and log class, or select data sources using
dataSource syntax in LogsQL, PPL, and SQL.

For more information about the `SOURCE` command, see [SOURCE](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax-Source.html).

If you have associated a AWS KMS key with the query results in this
account, then [StartQuery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_StartQuery.html) uses
that key to encrypt the results when it stores them. If no key is associated with query
results, the query results are encrypted with the default CloudWatch Logs encryption
method.

Queries time out after 60 minutes of runtime. If your queries are timing out, reduce the
time range being searched or partition your query into a number of queries.

If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use this operation
in a monitoring account to start a query in a linked source account. For more information, see
[CloudWatch cross-account observability](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-unified-cross-account.md). For a cross-account `StartQuery`
operation, the query definition must be defined in the monitoring account.

You can have up to 100 concurrent CloudWatch Logs insights queries, including queries
that have been added to dashboards.

}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[endTime](#API_StartQuery_RequestSyntax)**

The end of the time range to query. The range is inclusive, so the specified end time is
included in the query. Specified as epoch time, the number of seconds since `January 1,
        1970, 00:00:00 UTC`.

Type: Long

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.

Required: Yes

**[limit](#API_StartQuery_RequestSyntax)**

The maximum number of log events to return in the query. If the query string uses the
`fields` command, only the specified fields and their values are returned. The
default is 10,000.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 10000.

Required: No

**[logGroupIdentifiers](#API_StartQuery_RequestSyntax)**

The list of log groups to query. You can include up to 50 log groups.

You can specify them by the log group name or ARN. If a log group that you're querying is
in a source account and you're using a monitoring account, you must specify the ARN of the log
group here. The query definition must also be defined in the monitoring account.

If you specify an ARN, use the format
arn:aws:logs: _region_: _account-id_:log-group: _log\_group\_name_
Don't include an \* at the end.

A `StartQuery` operation must include exactly one of the following parameters:
`logGroupName`, `logGroupNames`, or `logGroupIdentifiers`.
The exception is queries using the OpenSearch Service SQL query language, where you specify
the log group names inside the `querystring` instead of here.

{
   "queryId": "12ab3456-12ab-123a-789e-1234567890ab"
}
```

### Example: Start a query

This example starts a query for a log group ARN and specifies a query string. It
also specifies the request start and end times.

#### Sample Request

```

{
    "limit": 100,
    "logGroupIdentifiers": [
        "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:log-group:monitoring-logGroup-1234"
     ],
    "queryString": "stats count(*) by eventSource, eventName, awsRegion",
    "startTime": 1546300800,
    "endTime": 1546309800
}
```

#### Sample Response

```

{
    "queryId": "12ab3456-12ab-123a-789e-1234567890ab"
}
```

### Example: Start a query using field indexing and the source command

This example queries all log groups in the `111122223333` account that have
log group names that start with `my-log`. It leverages field indexing so that
only log groups and log events known to match the indexed field `transactionId`
are processed. Only log events that include the value `tx-001` for the
`transactionId` field will be returned.

#### Sample Request

```

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: logs.<region>.<domain>
X-Amz-Date: <DATE>
