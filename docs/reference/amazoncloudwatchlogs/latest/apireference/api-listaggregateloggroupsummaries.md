# ListAggregateLogGroupSummaries

Returns an aggregate summary of all log groups in the Region grouped by specified data
source characteristics. Supports optional filtering by log group class, name patterns, and
data sources. If you perform this action in a monitoring account, you can also return
aggregated summaries of log groups from source accounts that are linked to the monitoring
account. For more information about using cross-account observability to set up monitoring
accounts and source accounts, see [CloudWatch\
cross-account observability](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-unified-cross-account.md).

The operation aggregates log groups by data source name and type and optionally format,
providing counts of log groups that share these characteristics. The operation paginates
results. By default, it returns up to 50 results and includes a token to retrieve more
results.

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[accountIdentifiers](#API_ListAggregateLogGroupSummaries_RequestSyntax)**

When `includeLinkedAccounts` is set to `true`, use this parameter to
specify the list of accounts to search. You can specify as many as 20 account IDs in the
array.

Type: Array of strings

Array Members: Minimum number of 0 items. Maximum number of 20 items.

Length Constraints: Fixed length of 12.

Pattern: `^\d{12}$`

Required: No

**[dataSources](#API_ListAggregateLogGroupSummaries_RequestSyntax)**

Filters the results by data source characteristics to include only log groups associated
with the specified data sources.

Type: Array of [DataSourceFilter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_DataSourceFilter.html) objects

Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number of 5 items.

Required: No

**[groupBy](#API_ListAggregateLogGroupSummaries_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies how to group the log groups in the summary.

Type: String

Valid Values: `DATA_SOURCE_NAME_TYPE_AND_FORMAT | DATA_SOURCE_NAME_AND_TYPE`

Required: Yes

**[includeLinkedAccounts](#API_ListAggregateLogGroupSummaries_RequestSyntax)**

If you are using a monitoring account, set this to `true` to have the operation
return log groups in the accounts listed in `accountIdentifiers`.

If this parameter is set to `true` and `accountIdentifiers` contains
a null value, the operation returns all log groups in the monitoring account and all log
groups in all source accounts that are linked to the monitoring account.

The default for this parameter is `false`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[limit](#API_ListAggregateLogGroupSummaries_RequestSyntax)**

The maximum number of aggregated summaries to return. If you omit this parameter, the
default is up to 50 aggregated summaries.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 50.

Required: No

**[logGroupClass](#API_ListAggregateLogGroupSummaries_RequestSyntax)**

Filters the results by log group class to include only log groups of the specified
class.

Type: String

Valid Values: `STANDARD | INFREQUENT_ACCESS | DELIVERY`

Required: No

**[logGroupNamePattern](#API_ListAggregateLogGroupSummaries_RequestSyntax)**

Use this parameter to limit the returned log groups to only those with names that match
the pattern that you specify. This parameter is a regular expression that can match prefixes
and substrings, and supports wildcard matching and matching multiple patterns, as in the
following examples.

- Use `^` to match log group names by prefix.

- For a substring match, specify the string to match. All matches are case
sensitive

- To match multiple patterns, separate them with a `|` as in the example
`^/aws/lambda|discovery`

You can specify as many as five different regular expression patterns in this field, each
of which must be between 3 and 24 characters. You can include the `^` symbol as
many as five times, and include the `|` symbol as many as four times.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 3. Maximum length of 129.

Pattern: `(\^?[\.\-_\/#A-Za-z0-9]{3,24})(\|\^?[\.\-_\/#A-Za-z0-9]{3,24}){0,4}`

Required: No

**[nextToken](#API_ListAggregateLogGroupSummaries_RequestSyntax)**

The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires after 24
hours.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.

Required: No
