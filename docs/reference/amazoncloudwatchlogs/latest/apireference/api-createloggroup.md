# CreateLogGroup

Creates a log group with the specified name. You can create up to 1,000,000 log groups
per Region per account.

You must use the following guidelines when naming a log group:

- Log group names must be unique within a Region for an AWS
account.

- Log group names can be between 1 and 512 characters long.

- Log group names consist of the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '\_'
(underscore), '-' (hyphen), '/' (forward slash), '.' (period), and '#' (number
sign)

- Log group names can't start with the string `aws/`

When you create a log group, by default the log events in the log group do not expire.
To set a retention policy so that events expire and are deleted after a specified time, use
[PutRetentionPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutRetentionPolicy.html).

If you associate an AWS KMS key with the log group, ingested data is
encrypted using the KMS key. This association is stored as long as the data
encrypted with the KMS key is still within CloudWatch Logs. This enables
CloudWatch Logs to decrypt this data whenever it is requested.

If you attempt to associate a KMS key with the log group but the KMS key does not exist or the KMS key is disabled, you receive an
`InvalidParameterException` error.

###### Important

CloudWatch Logs supports only symmetric KMS keys. Do not associate an
asymmetric KMS key with your log group. For more information, see [Using\
Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html).

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "deletionProtectionEnabled": boolean,
   "kmsKeyId": "string",
   "logGroupClass": "string",
   "logGroupName": "string",
   "tags": {
      "string" : "string"
   }
}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[deletionProtectionEnabled](#API_CreateLogGroup_RequestSyntax)**

Use this parameter to enable deletion protection for the new log group. When enabled on
a log group, deletion protection blocks all deletion operations until it is explicitly
disabled. By default log groups are created without deletion protection enabled.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[kmsKeyId](#API_CreateLogGroup_RequestSyntax)**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key to use when encrypting log
data. For more information, see [Amazon Resource\
Names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arn-syntax-kms).

Type: String

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.

Required: No

**[logGroupClass](#API_CreateLogGroup_RequestSyntax)**

Use this parameter to specify the log group class for this log group. There are three
classes:

- The `Standard` log class supports all CloudWatch Logs features.

- The `Infrequent Access` log class supports a subset of CloudWatch Logs
features and incurs lower costs.

- Use the `Delivery` log class only for delivering AWS Lambda
logs to store in Amazon S3 or Amazon Data Firehose. Log events in log groups in
the Delivery class are kept in CloudWatch Logs for only one day. This log class doesn't
offer rich CloudWatch Logs capabilities such as CloudWatch Logs Insights
queries.

If you omit this parameter, the default of `STANDARD` is used.

###### Important

The value of `logGroupClass` can't be changed after a log group is
created.

For details about the features supported by each class, see [Log classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch_Logs_Log_Classes.html)

Type: String

Valid Values: `STANDARD | INFREQUENT_ACCESS | DELIVERY`

Required: No

**[logGroupName](#API_CreateLogGroup_RequestSyntax)**

A name for the log group.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 512.

Pattern: `[\.\-_/#A-Za-z0-9]+`

Required: Yes

**[tags](#API_CreateLogGroup_RequestSyntax)**

The key-value pairs to use for the tags.

You can grant users access to certain log groups while preventing them from accessing
other log groups. To do so, tag your groups and use IAM policies that refer to
those tags. To assign tags when you create a log group, you must have either the
`logs:TagResource` or `logs:TagLogGroup` permission. For more
information about tagging, see [Tagging AWS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html). For
more information about using tags to control access, see [Controlling access to Amazon Web Services\
resources using tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html).

Type: String to string map

Map Entries: Maximum number of 50 items.

Key Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Key Pattern: `^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]+)$`

Value Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.

Value Pattern: `^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$`

Required: No

## Response Elements
