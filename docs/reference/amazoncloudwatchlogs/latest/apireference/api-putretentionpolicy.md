# PutRetentionPolicy

Sets the retention of the specified log group. With a retention policy, you can
configure the number of days for which to retain log events in the specified log
group.

###### Note

CloudWatch Logs doesn't immediately delete log events when they reach their retention
setting. It typically takes up to 72 hours after that before log events are deleted, but in
rare situations might take longer.

To illustrate, imagine that you change a log group to have a longer retention setting
when it contains log events that are past the expiration date, but haven't been deleted.
Those log events will take up to 72 hours to be deleted after the new retention date is
reached. To make sure that log data is deleted permanently, keep a log group at its lower
retention setting until 72 hours after the previous retention period ends. Alternatively,
wait to change the retention setting until you confirm that the earlier log events are
deleted.

When log events reach their retention setting they are marked for deletion. After they
are marked for deletion, they do not add to your archival storage costs anymore, even if
they are not actually deleted until later. These log events marked for deletion are also not
included when you use an API to retrieve the `storedBytes` value to see how many
bytes a log group is storing.
