# GetLogEvents

Lists log events from the specified log stream. You can list all of the log events or
filter using a time range.

`GetLogEvents` is a paginated operation. Each page returned can contain up to 1
MB of log events or up to 10,000 log events. A returned page might only be partially full, or
even empty. For example, if the result of a query would return 15,000 log events, the first
page isn't guaranteed to have 10,000 log events even if they all fit into 1 MB.

Partially full or empty pages don't necessarily mean that pagination is finished. As long
as the `nextBackwardToken` or `nextForwardToken` returned is NOT equal
to the `nextToken` that you passed into the API call, there might be more log
events available. The token that you use depends on the direction you want to move in along
the log stream. The returned tokens are never null.

###### Note

If you set `startFromHead` to `true` and you don’t include
`endTime` in your request, you can end up in a situation where the pagination
doesn't terminate. This can happen when the new log events are being added to the target log
streams faster than they are being read. This situation is a good use case for the CloudWatch Logs
[Live Tail](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/cloudwatchlogs-livetail.md) feature.

If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use this operation
in a monitoring account and view data from the linked source accounts. For more information,
see [CloudWatch cross-account observability](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-unified-cross-account.md).

You can specify the log group to search by using either `logGroupIdentifier` or
`logGroupName`. You must include one of these two parameters, but you can't
include both.

###### Note

If you are using [log\
transformation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation.html), the `GetLogEvents` operation returns only the original
versions of log events, before they were transformed. To view the transformed versions, you
must use a [CloudWatch Logs\
query.](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/analyzinglogdata.md)

## Request Syntax

```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[endTime](#API_GetLogEvents_RequestSyntax)**

The end of the time range, expressed as the number of milliseconds after `Jan 1,
        1970 00:00:00 UTC`. Events with a timestamp equal to or later than this time are not
included.

Type: Long

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.

Required: No

**[limit](#API_GetLogEvents_RequestSyntax)**

The maximum number of log events returned. If you don't specify a limit, the default is
as many log events as can fit in a response size of 1 MB (up to 10,000 log events).

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 10000.

Required: No

**[logGroupIdentifier](#API_GetLogEvents_RequestSyntax)**

Specify either the name or ARN of the log group to view events from. If the log group is
in a source account and you are using a monitoring account, you must use the log group
ARN.

###### Note

You must include either `logGroupIdentifier` or `logGroupName`,
but not both.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048.

Pattern: `[\w#+=/:,.@-]*`

Required: No

**[logGroupName](#API_GetLogEvents_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the log group.

###### Note

You must include either `logGroupIdentifier` or `logGroupName`,
but not both.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 512.

Pattern: `[\.\-_/#A-Za-z0-9]+`

Required: No

**[logStreamName](#API_GetLogEvents_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the log stream.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 512.

Pattern: `[^:*]*`

Required: Yes

**[nextToken](#API_GetLogEvents_RequestSyntax)**

The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token from a previous
call.)

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.

Required: No

**[startFromHead](#API_GetLogEvents_RequestSyntax)**

If the value is true, the earliest log events are returned first. If the value is
false, the latest log events are returned first. The default value is false.

If you are using a previous `nextForwardToken` value as the
`nextToken` in this operation, you must specify `true` for
`startFromHead`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[startTime](#API_GetLogEvents_RequestSyntax)**

The start of the time range, expressed as the number of milliseconds after `Jan 1,
        1970 00:00:00 UTC`. Events with a timestamp equal to this time or later than this time
are included. Events with a timestamp earlier than this time are not included.

Type: Long

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.

Required: No

**[unmask](#API_GetLogEvents_RequestSyntax)**

Specify `true` to display the log event fields with all sensitive data unmasked
and visible. The default is `false`.

To use this operation with this parameter, you must be signed into an account with the
`logs:Unmask` permission.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

## Response Syntax

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[events](#API_GetLogEvents_ResponseSyntax)**

Type: Array of [OutputLogEvent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_OutputLogEvent.html) objects

**[nextBackwardToken](#API_GetLogEvents_ResponseSyntax)**

24 hours. This token is not null. If you have reached the end of the stream, it returns the
same token you passed in.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.

**[nextForwardToken](#API_GetLogEvents_ResponseSyntax)**
