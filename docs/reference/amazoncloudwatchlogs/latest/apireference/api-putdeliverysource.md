# PutDeliverySource

Creates or updates a logical _delivery source_. A delivery source
represents an AWS resource that sends logs to an logs delivery destination. The
destination can be CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, Firehose or X-Ray for sending traces.

To configure logs delivery between a delivery destination and an AWS
service that is supported as a delivery source, you must do the following:

- Use `PutDeliverySource` to create a delivery source, which is a logical
object that represents the resource that is actually sending the logs.

- Use `PutDeliveryDestination` to create a _delivery_
_destination_, which is a logical object that represents the actual delivery
destination. For more information, see [PutDeliveryDestination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliveryDestination.html).

- If you are delivering logs cross-account, you must use [PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy.html) in the destination account to assign an IAM policy to the destination. This policy allows delivery to that destination.

- Use `CreateDelivery` to create a _delivery_ by pairing
exactly one delivery source and one delivery destination. For more information, see [CreateDelivery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDelivery.html).

You can configure a single delivery source to send logs to multiple destinations by
creating multiple deliveries. You can also create multiple deliveries to configure multiple
delivery sources to send logs to the same delivery destination.

Only some AWS services support being configured as a delivery source. These
services are listed as **Supported \[V2 Permissions\]** in the
table at [Enabling logging from\
AWS services.](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/aws-logs-and-resource-policy.md)

If you use this operation to update an existing delivery source, all the current delivery
source parameters are overwritten with the new parameter values that you specify.
