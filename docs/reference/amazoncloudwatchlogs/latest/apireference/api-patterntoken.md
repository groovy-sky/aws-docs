# PatternToken

A structure that contains information about one pattern token related to an
anomaly.

For more information about patterns and tokens, see [CreateLogAnomalyDetector](api-createloganomalydetector.md).

## Contents

**dynamicTokenPosition**

For a dynamic token, this indicates where in the pattern that this token appears, related
to other dynamic tokens. The dynamic token that appears first has a value of `1`,
the one that appears second is `2`, and so on.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**enumerations**

Contains the values found for a dynamic token, and the number of times each value was
found.

Type: String to long map

Key Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.

Required: No

**inferredTokenName**

A name that CloudWatch Logs assigned to this dynamic token to make the pattern more
readable. The string part of the `inferredTokenName` gives you a clearer idea of
the content of this token. The number part of the `inferredTokenName` shows where
in the pattern this token appears, compared to other dynamic tokens. CloudWatch Logs
assigns the string part of the name based on analyzing the content of the log events that
contain it.

For example, an inferred token name of `IPAddress-3` means that the token
represents an IP address, and this token is the third dynamic token in the pattern.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.

Required: No

**isDynamic**

Specifies whether this is a dynamic token.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**tokenString**

The string represented by this token. If this is a dynamic token, the value will be
`<*>`

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.

Required: No
