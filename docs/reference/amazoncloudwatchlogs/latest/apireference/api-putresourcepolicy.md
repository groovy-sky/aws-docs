# PutResourcePolicy

Creates or updates a resource policy allowing other AWS services to put
log events to this account, such as Amazon Route 53. This API has the following
restrictions:

- **Supported actions** \- Policy only supports
`logs:PutLogEvents` and `logs:CreateLogStream ` actions

- **Supported principals** \- Policy only applies when
operations are invoked by AWS service principals (not IAM
users, roles, or cross-account principals

- **Policy limits** \- An account can have a maximum of 10
policies without resourceARN and one per LogGroup resourceARN

###### Important

Resource policies with actions invoked by non-AWS service principals
(such as IAM users, roles, or other AWS accounts) will not be
enforced. For access control involving these principals, use the IAM
policies.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "expectedRevisionId": "string",
   "policyDocument": "string",
   "policyName": "string",
   "resourceArn": "string"
}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[expectedRevisionId](#API_PutResourcePolicy_RequestSyntax)**

The expected revision ID of the resource policy. Required when `resourceArn` is
provided to prevent concurrent modifications. Use `null` when creating a resource
policy for the first time.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.

Required: No

**[policyDocument](#API_PutResourcePolicy_RequestSyntax)**

Details of the new policy, including the identity of the principal that is enabled to
put logs to this account. This is formatted as a JSON string. This parameter is
required.

The following example creates a resource policy enabling the Route 53 service to put
DNS query logs in to the specified log group. Replace `"logArn"` with the ARN of
your CloudWatch Logs resource, such as a log group or log stream.

CloudWatch Logs also supports [aws:SourceArn](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourcearn) and [aws:SourceAccount](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourceaccount) condition context keys.

In the example resource policy, you would replace the value of `SourceArn` with
the resource making the call from Route 53 to CloudWatch Logs. You would also
replace the value of `SourceAccount` with the AWS account ID making
that call.

Type: String

Required: No

**[resourceArn](#API_PutResourcePolicy_RequestSyntax)**

Type: String

Required: No
