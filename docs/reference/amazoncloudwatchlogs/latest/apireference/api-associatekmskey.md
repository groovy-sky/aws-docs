# AssociateKmsKey

Associates the specified AWS KMS key with either one log group in the
account, or with all stored CloudWatch Logs query insights results in the
account.

When you use `AssociateKmsKey`, you specify either the
`logGroupName` parameter or the `resourceIdentifier` parameter. You
can't specify both of those parameters in the same operation.

- Specify the `logGroupName` parameter to cause log events ingested into that
log group to be encrypted with that key. Only the log events ingested after the key is
associated are encrypted with that key.

Associating a KMS key with a log group overrides any existing
associations between the log group and a KMS key. After a KMS key is associated with a log group, all newly ingested data for the log group
is encrypted using the KMS key. This association is stored as long as the
data encrypted with the KMS key is still within CloudWatch Logs. This
enables CloudWatch Logs to decrypt this data whenever it is requested.

Associating a key with a log group does not cause the results of queries of that log
group to be encrypted with that key. To have query results encrypted with a AWS KMS key, you must use an `AssociateKmsKey` operation with the
`resourceIdentifier` parameter that specifies a `query-result`
resource.

- Specify the `resourceIdentifier` parameter with a `query-result`
resource, to use that key to encrypt the stored results of all future [StartQuery](api-startquery.md) operations in the account. The response from a [GetQueryResults](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_GetQueryResults.html) operation will still return the query results in plain
text.

Even if you have not associated a key with your query results, the query results are
encrypted when stored, using the default CloudWatch Logs method.

If you run a query from a monitoring account that queries logs in a source account,
the query results key from the monitoring account, if any, is used.

###### Important

If you delete the key that is used to encrypt log events or log group query results,
then all the associated stored log events or query results that were encrypted with that key
will be unencryptable and unusable.

###### Note

CloudWatch Logs supports only symmetric KMS keys. Do not associate an
asymmetric KMS key with your log group or query results. For more
information, see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric\
Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html).

It can take up to 5 minutes for this operation to take effect.

If you attempt to associate a KMS key with a log group but the KMS key does not exist or the KMS key is disabled, you receive an
`InvalidParameterException` error.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "kmsKeyId": "string",
   "logGroupName": "string",
   "resourceIdentifier": "string"
}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[kmsKeyId](#API_AssociateKmsKey_RequestSyntax)**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key to use when encrypting log
data. This must be a symmetric KMS key. For more information, see [Amazon Resource Names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arn-syntax-kms) and [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric\
Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html).

Type: String

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.

Required: Yes

**[logGroupName](#API_AssociateKmsKey_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the log group.

In your `AssociateKmsKey` operation, you must specify either the
`resourceIdentifier` parameter or the `logGroup` parameter, but you
can't specify both.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 512.

Pattern: `[\.\-_/#A-Za-z0-9]+`

Required: No

**[resourceIdentifier](#API_AssociateKmsKey_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the target for this operation. You must specify one of the following:

- Specify the following ARN to have future [GetQueryResults](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_GetQueryResults.html) operations in this account encrypt the results with the
specified AWS KMS key. Replace _REGION_ and
_ACCOUNT\_ID_ with your Region and account ID.

`arn:aws:logs:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:query-result:*`

- Specify the ARN of a log group to have CloudWatch Logs use the AWS KMS key to encrypt log events that are ingested and stored by that log
group. The log group ARN must be in the following format. Replace
_REGION_ and _ACCOUNT\_ID_ with your Region and
account ID.

`arn:aws:logs:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:log-group:LOG_GROUP_NAME
                          `

In your `AssociateKmsKey` operation, you must specify either the
`resourceIdentifier` parameter or the `logGroup` parameter, but you
can't specify both.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048.

Pattern: `[\w+=/:,.@\-\*]*`

Required: No

## Response Elements
