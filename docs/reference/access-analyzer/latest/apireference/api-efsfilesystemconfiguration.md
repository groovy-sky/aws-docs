# EfsFileSystemConfiguration

The proposed access control configuration for an Amazon EFS file system. You can propose a
configuration for a new Amazon EFS file system or an existing Amazon EFS file system that you own by
specifying the Amazon EFS policy. For more information, see [Using file systems in Amazon EFS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/using-fs.html).

- If the configuration is for an existing Amazon EFS file system and you do not specify
the Amazon EFS policy, then the access preview uses the existing Amazon EFS policy for the file
system.

- If the access preview is for a new resource and you do not specify the policy,
then the access preview assumes an Amazon EFS file system without a policy.

- To propose deletion of an existing Amazon EFS file system policy, you can specify an
empty string for the Amazon EFS policy.
