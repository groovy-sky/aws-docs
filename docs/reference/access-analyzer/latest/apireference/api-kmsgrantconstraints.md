# KmsGrantConstraints

Use this structure to propose allowing [cryptographic\
operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations) in the grant only when the operation request includes the specified
[encryption\
context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context). You can specify only one type of encryption context. An empty map is
treated as not specified. For more information, see [GrantConstraints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GrantConstraints.html).

## Contents

**encryptionContextEquals**

A list of key-value pairs that must match the encryption context in the [cryptographic\
operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations) request. The grant allows the operation only when the encryption
context in the request is the same as the encryption context specified in this
constraint.

Type: String to string map

Required: No

**encryptionContextSubset**

A list of key-value pairs that must be included in the encryption context of the [cryptographic\
operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations) request. The grant allows the cryptographic operation only when the
encryption context in the request includes the key-value pairs specified in this
constraint, although it can include additional key-value pairs.

Type: String to string map

Required: No
