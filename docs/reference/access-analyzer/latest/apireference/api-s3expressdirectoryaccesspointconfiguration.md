# S3ExpressDirectoryAccessPointConfiguration

Proposed configuration for an access point attached to an Amazon S3 directory bucket. You can
propose up to 10 access points per bucket. If the proposed access point configuration is
for an existing Amazon S3 directory bucket, the access preview uses the proposed access point
configuration in place of the existing access points. To propose an access point without a
policy, you can provide an empty string as the access point policy. For more information
about access points for Amazon S3 directory buckets, see [Managing access to\
directory buckets with access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points-directory-buckets.html) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.
