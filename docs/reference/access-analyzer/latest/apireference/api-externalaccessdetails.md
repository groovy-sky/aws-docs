Contains information about an external access finding.

## Contents

**condition**

The condition in the analyzed policy statement that resulted in an external access
finding.

Type: String to string map

Required: Yes

**action**

The action in the analyzed policy statement that an external principal has permission to
use.

Type: Array of strings

**resourceControlPolicyRestriction**

The type of restriction applied to the finding by the resource owner with an Organizations
resource control policy (RCP).

- `APPLICABLE`: There is an RCP present in the organization but
IAM Access Analyzer does not include it in the evaluation of effective permissions. For
example, if `s3:DeleteObject` is blocked by the RCP and the restriction is
`APPLICABLE`, then `s3:DeleteObject` would still be included
in the list of actions for the finding.

- `FAILED_TO_EVALUATE_RCP`: There was an error evaluating the RCP.

- `NOT_APPLICABLE`: There was no RCP present in the organization, or
there was no RCP applicable to the resource. For example, the resource being analyzed
is an Amazon RDS snapshot and there is an RCP in the organization, but the RCP only
impacts Amazon S3 buckets.

- `APPLIED`: This restriction is not currently available for external
access findings.

Type: String

Valid Values: `APPLICABLE | FAILED_TO_EVALUATE_RCP | NOT_APPLICABLE | APPLIED`

Required: No

**sources**

The sources of the external access finding. This indicates how the access that generated
the finding is granted. It is populated for Amazon S3 bucket findings.
