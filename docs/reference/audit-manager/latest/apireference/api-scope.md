# Scope

The wrapper that contains the AWS accounts that are in
scope for the assessment.

###### Note

You no longer need to specify which AWS services are in scope when you
create or update an assessment. Audit Manager infers the services in scope by
examining your assessment controls and their data sources, and then mapping this
information to the relevant AWS services.

If an underlying data source changes for your assessment, we automatically update the
services scope as needed to reflect the correct AWS services. This
ensures that your assessment collects accurate and comprehensive evidence about all of
the relevant services in your AWS environment.
