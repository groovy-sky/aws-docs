# Scope
<a name="API_Scope"></a>

 The wrapper that contains the AWS accounts that are in scope for the assessment.

**Note**
You no longer need to specify which AWS services are in scope when you create or update an assessment. Audit Manager infers the services in scope by examining your assessment controls and their data sources, and then mapping this information to the relevant AWS services.
If an underlying data source changes for your assessment, we automatically update the services scope as needed to reflect the correct AWS services. This ensures that your assessment collects accurate and comprehensive evidence about all of the relevant services in your AWS environment.
