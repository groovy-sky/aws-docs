# GetServicesInScope

Gets a list of the AWS services from which Audit Manager can collect
evidence.

Audit Manager defines which AWS services are in scope for an
assessment. Audit Manager infers this scope by examining the assessment’s controls and
their data sources, and then mapping this information to one or more of the corresponding
AWS services that are in this list.

###### Note

For information about why it's no longer possible to specify services in scope manually, see
[I can't edit the services in scope for my assessment](../../../../services/audit-manager/latest/userguide/evidence-collection-issues.md#unable-to-edit-services) in
the _Troubleshooting_ section of the AWS Audit Manager user
guide.
