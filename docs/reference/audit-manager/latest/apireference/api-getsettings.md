## Examples

### Confirming the status of evidence finder

This is an example response for the `GetSettings` API operation, where
the `attribute` parameter is set to
`EVIDENCE_FINDER_ENABLEMENT`.

This response returns the following evidence finder settings:

- `eventDataStoreArn` shows the ARN of the event data store that
was created when evidence finder was enabled.

- `enablementStatus` shows the current status of evidence finder.
In this case, `ENABLED` indicates that evidence finder was
successfully enabled.

- `backfillStatus` shows the current status of the evidence data
backfill. In this case, `IN_PROGRESS` indicates that the backfill is
not yet complete.

#### Sample Response

```json

{
    "settings": {
        "evidenceFinderEnablement": {
            "eventDataStoreArn": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:111122223333:eventdatastore/1q2w3e4r-2w3e-4r5t-6y7u-1q2w3e4r5t6y",
            "enablementStatus": "ENABLED",
            "backfillStatus": "IN_PROGRESS"
        }
    }
}
```

### Reviewing your data retention settings

This is an example response for the `GetSettings` API operation, where
the `attribute` parameter is set to
`DEREGISTRATION_POLICY`.

This response returns your current data retention preferences. In this case,
`deleteResources` has a value of `DEFAULT`. This indicates
that your Audit Manager data is subject to default data retention policies. For
more information about data retention, see [Data Protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/data-protection.html)
in the _AWS Audit Manager User Guide._

#### Sample Response

```json

{
    "settings": {
        "deregistrationPolicy": {
            "deleteResources": "DEFAULT"
        }
    }
}
```

### Reviewing your Audit Manager notification settings

This is an example response for the `GetSettings` API operation, where
the `attribute` parameter is set to `SNS_TOPIC`.

If an SNS topic is in use, the response returns the ARN for that topic.

#### Sample Response

```json

{
    "settings": {
        "snsTopic": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111122223333:my-assessment-topic"
    }
}
```

### Reviewing the default audit owners for your Audit Manager assessments

This is an example response for the `GetSettings` API operation, where
the `attribute` parameter is set to
`DEFAULT_PROCESS_OWNERS`.

If one or more default audit owners were specified, the response returns the ARN
for each audit owner's role.

#### Sample Response

```json

{
    "settings": {
        "defaultProcessOwners": [
            {
                "roleType": "PROCESS_OWNER",
                "roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Administrator"

        ]
