 ** complianceCheck **   <a name="auditmanager-Type-Evidence-complianceCheck"></a>
The evaluation status for automated evidence that falls under the compliance check category.

+ Audit Manager classes evidence as compliant if Security Hub CSPM reports a *Pass* result, or if AWS Config reports a *Compliant* result.

This is the case if the evidence uses AWS Config or Security Hub CSPM as the underlying data source type, but those services aren't enabled.
