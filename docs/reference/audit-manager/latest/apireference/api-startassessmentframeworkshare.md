# StartAssessmentFrameworkShare
<a name="API_StartAssessmentFrameworkShare"></a>

**Important**
 AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

 Creates a share request for a custom framework in AWS Audit Manager.

The share request specifies a recipient and notifies them that a custom framework is available. Recipients have 120 days to accept or decline the request. If no action is taken, the share request expires.

When you create a share request, Audit Manager stores a snapshot of your custom framework in the US East (N. Virginia) AWS Region. Audit Manager also stores a backup of the same snapshot in the US West (Oregon) AWS Region.

Audit Manager deletes the snapshot and the backup snapshot when one of the following events occurs:
+ The sender revokes the share request.
+ The recipient declines the share request.
+ The recipient encounters an error and doesn't successfully accept the share request.
+ The share request expires before the recipient responds to the request.

When a sender [resends a share request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/framework-sharing.html#framework-sharing-resend), the snapshot is replaced with an updated version that corresponds with the latest version of the custom framework.

When a recipient accepts a share request, the snapshot is replicated into their AWS account under the AWS Region that was specified in the share request.

**Important**
When you invoke the `StartAssessmentFrameworkShare` API, you are about to share a custom framework with another AWS account. You may not share a custom framework that is derived from a standard framework if the standard framework is designated as not eligible for sharing by AWS, unless you have obtained permission to do so from the owner of the standard framework. To learn more about which standard frameworks are eligible for sharing, see [Framework sharing eligibility](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/share-custom-framework-concepts-and-terminology.html#eligibility) in the * AWS Audit Manager User Guide*.
