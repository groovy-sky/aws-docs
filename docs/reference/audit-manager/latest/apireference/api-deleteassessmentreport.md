# DeleteAssessmentReport
<a name="API_DeleteAssessmentReport"></a>

**Important**
 AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

Deletes an assessment report in AWS Audit Manager.

When you run the `DeleteAssessmentReport` operation, Audit Manager attempts to delete the following data:

1. The specified assessment report that’s stored in your S3 bucket

1. The associated metadata that’s stored in Audit Manager

If Audit Manager can’t access the assessment report in your S3 bucket, the report isn’t deleted. In this event, the `DeleteAssessmentReport` operation doesn’t fail. Instead, it proceeds to delete the associated metadata only. You must then delete the assessment report from the S3 bucket yourself.

This scenario happens when Audit Manager receives a `403 (Forbidden)` or `404 (Not Found)` error from Amazon S3. To avoid this, make sure that your S3 bucket is available, and that you configured the correct permissions for Audit Manager to delete resources in your S3 bucket. For an example permissions policy that you can use, see [Assessment report destination permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#full-administrator-access-assessment-report-destination) in the * AWS Audit Manager User Guide*. For information about the issues that could cause a `403 (Forbidden)` or `404 (Not Found`) error from Amazon S3, see [List of Error Codes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference*.
