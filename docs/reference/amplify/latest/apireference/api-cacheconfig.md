**type**

The type of cache configuration to use for an Amplify app.

The `AMPLIFY_MANAGED` cache configuration automatically applies an
optimized cache configuration for your app based on its platform, routing rules, and
rewrite rules.

The `AMPLIFY_MANAGED_NO_COOKIES` cache configuration type is the same as
`AMPLIFY_MANAGED`, except that it excludes all cookies from the cache
key. This is the default setting.

Type: String

Valid Values: `AMPLIFY_MANAGED | AMPLIFY_MANAGED_NO_COOKIES`
