# JobConfig

Describes the configuration details that apply to the jobs for an Amplify app.

Use `JobConfig` to apply configuration to jobs, such as customizing the build instance size when you create or
update an Amplify app. For more information about customizable build
instances, see [Custom build instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/custom-build-instance.html) in the _Amplify User Guide_.
