# PerformanceInsightsMetricQuery

A single Performance Insights metric query to process. You must provide the metric to the query.
If other parameters aren't specified, Performance Insights returns all data points for the
specified metric. Optionally, you can request the data points to be aggregated by dimension
group ( `GroupBy`) and return only those data points that match your criteria ( `Filter`).

Constraints:

- Must be a valid Performance Insights query.

## Contents

###### Note

In the following list, the required parameters are described first.

**GroupBy**

A specification for how to aggregate the data points from a query result. You must
specify a valid dimension group. Performance Insights will return all of the dimensions within that group,
unless you provide the names of specific dimensions within that group. You can also request
that Performance Insights return a limited number of values for a dimension.

Type: [PerformanceInsightsMetricDimensionGroup](api-performanceinsightsmetricdimensiongroup.md) object

Required: No

**Metric**

The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

Valid Values:

- `db.load.avg` \- A scaled representation of the number of active sessions for the
database engine.

- `db.sampledload.avg` \- The raw number of active sessions for the database engine.

- The counter metrics listed in [Performance Insights\
operating system counters](../../../../services/amazonrds/latest/aurorauserguide/user-perfinsights-counters.md#USER_PerfInsights_Counters.OS) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

If the number of active sessions is less than an internal Performance Insights threshold, `db.load.avg`
and `db.sampledload.avg` are the same value. If the number of active sessions is greater than the
internal threshold, Performance Insights samples the active sessions, with `db.load.avg` showing the
scaled values, `db.sampledload.avg` showing the raw values, and `db.sampledload.avg` less than
`db.load.avg`. For most use cases, you can query `db.load.avg` only.

Type: String

Required: No
