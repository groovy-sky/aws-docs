created if automated backups are enabled, as determined
by the `BackupRetentionPeriod`.

Type: String

Required: No

**ProcessorFeatures.ProcessorFeature.N**

Specifies when the snapshot was taken in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Changes for the copy when the snapshot is copied.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**SnapshotDatabaseTime**

The timestamp of the most recent transaction applied to the database that you're backing up.
Thus, if you restore a snapshot, SnapshotDatabaseTime is the most recent transaction in the restored DB instance.
In contrast, originalSnapshotCreateTime specifies the system time that the snapshot completed.

If you back up a read replica, you can determine the replica lag by comparing SnapshotDatabaseTime
with originalSnapshotCreateTime. For example, if originalSnapshotCreateTime is two hours later than
SnapshotDatabaseTime, then the replica lag is two hours.
