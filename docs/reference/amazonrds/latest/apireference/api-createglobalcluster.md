# CreateGlobalCluster

Creates an Aurora global database
spread across multiple AWS Regions. The global database
contains a single primary cluster with read-write capability,
and a read-only secondary cluster that receives
data from the primary cluster through high-speed replication
performed by the Aurora storage subsystem.

You can create a global database that is initially empty, and then
create the primary and secondary DB clusters in the global database.
Or you can specify an existing Aurora cluster during the create operation,
and this cluster becomes the primary cluster of the global database.

###### Note

This operation applies only to Aurora DB clusters.

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**GlobalClusterIdentifier**

The cluster identifier for this global database cluster. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 255.

Pattern: `[A-Za-z][0-9A-Za-z-:._]*`

Required: Yes

**DatabaseName**

The name for your database of up to 64 alphanumeric characters. If you don't specify
a name, Amazon Aurora doesn't create a database in the global database cluster.

Constraints:

- Can't be specified if `SourceDBClusterIdentifier` is specified. In this case, Amazon Aurora uses the database name from the source DB cluster.

Type: String

Required: No

**DeletionProtection**

Specifies whether to enable deletion protection for the new global database cluster.
The global database can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**Engine**

The database engine to use for this global database cluster.

Valid Values: `aurora-mysql | aurora-postgresql`

Constraints:

- Can't be specified if `SourceDBClusterIdentifier` is specified. In this case, Amazon Aurora uses the engine of the source DB cluster.

Type: String

Required: No

**EngineLifecycleSupport**

The life cycle type for this global database cluster.

###### Note

By default, this value is set to `open-source-rds-extended-support`, which enrolls your global cluster into Amazon RDS Extended Support.
At the end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by setting the value to `open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled`. In this case,
creating the global cluster will fail if the DB major version is past its end of standard support date.

This setting only applies to Aurora PostgreSQL-based global databases.

You can use this setting to enroll your global cluster into Amazon RDS Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support,
you can run the selected major engine version on your global cluster past the end of standard support for that engine version. For more information, see [Amazon RDS Extended Support with Amazon Aurora](../../../../services/amazonrds/latest/aurorauserguide/extended-support.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

Valid Values: `open-source-rds-extended-support | open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled`

Default: `open-source-rds-extended-support`

Type: String

Required: No

**EngineVersion**

The engine version to use for this global database cluster.

Constraints:

- Can't be specified if `SourceDBClusterIdentifier` is specified. In this case, Amazon Aurora uses the engine version of the source DB cluster.

Type: String

Required: No

**SourceDBClusterIdentifier**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to use as the primary cluster of the global database.

If you provide a value for this parameter, don't specify values for the following settings because Amazon Aurora uses the values from the specified source DB cluster:

- `DatabaseName`

- `Engine`

- `EngineVersion`

- `StorageEncrypted`

Type: String

Required: No

**StorageEncrypted**

Specifies whether to enable storage encryption for the new global database cluster.

Constraints:

- Can't be specified if `SourceDBClusterIdentifier` is specified. In this case, Amazon Aurora uses the setting from the source DB cluster.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**Tags.Tag.N**

Tags to assign to the global cluster.

Type: Array of [Tag](api-tag.md) objects

Required: No

## Response Elements

The following element is returned by the service.

**GlobalCluster**

A data type representing an Aurora global database.

Type: [GlobalCluster](api-globalcluster.md) object

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**DBClusterNotFoundFault**

`DBClusterIdentifier` doesn't refer to an existing DB cluster.

HTTP Status Code: 404

**GlobalClusterAlreadyExistsFault**

The `GlobalClusterIdentifier` already exists. Specify a new global database identifier
(unique name) to create a new global database cluster or to rename an existing one.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**GlobalClusterQuotaExceededFault**

The number of global database clusters for this account is already at the maximum allowed.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InvalidDBClusterStateFault**

The requested operation can't be performed while the cluster is in this state.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InvalidDBShardGroupState**

The DB shard group must be in the available state.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ResourceNotFoundFault**

The specified resource ID was not found.

HTTP Status Code: 404
