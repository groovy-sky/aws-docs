# ProcessorFeature

Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

To specify the number of CPU cores, use the `coreCount` feature name
for the `Name` parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the
`threadsPerCore` feature name for the `Name` parameter.

You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you
call one of the following actions:

- `CreateDBInstance`

- `ModifyDBInstance`

- `RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot`

- `RestoreDBInstanceFromS3`

- `RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime`

You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the
`DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions` action and specifying the
instance class for the `DBInstanceClass` parameter.

In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information:

- `DescribeDBInstances`

- `DescribeDBSnapshots`

- `DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications`

If you call `DescribeDBInstances`, `ProcessorFeature` returns
non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

- You are accessing an Oracle or SQL Server DB instance.

- Your Oracle or SQL Server DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core.

- The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value.
