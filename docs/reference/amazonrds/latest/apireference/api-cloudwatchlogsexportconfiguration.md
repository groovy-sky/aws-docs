# CloudwatchLogsExportConfiguration

The configuration setting for the log types to be enabled for export to CloudWatch
Logs for a specific DB instance or DB cluster.

The `EnableLogTypes` and `DisableLogTypes` arrays determine which logs will be exported
(or not exported) to CloudWatch Logs. The values within these arrays depend on the DB
engine being used.
