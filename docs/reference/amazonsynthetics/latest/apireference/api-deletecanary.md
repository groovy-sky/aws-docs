# DeleteCanary

Permanently deletes the specified canary.

If the canary's `ProvisionedResourceCleanup` field is set to `AUTOMATIC`
or you specify `DeleteLambda` in this operation as `true`, CloudWatch Synthetics also deletes
the Lambda functions and layers that are used by the canary.

Other resources used and created by the canary are not automatically deleted.
After you delete a canary, you
should also delete the following:

- The CloudWatch alarms created for this canary. These alarms have a name of
`Synthetics-Alarm-first-198-characters-of-canary-name-canaryId-alarm number
              `

- Amazon S3 objects and buckets, such as the canary's artifact location.

- IAM roles created for the canary. If they were created in the console, these roles
have the name `
                       role/service-role/CloudWatchSyntheticsRole-First-21-Characters-of-CanaryName
              `

- CloudWatch Logs log groups created for the canary. These logs groups have the name
`/aws/lambda/cwsyn-First-21-Characters-of-CanaryName
              `

Before you delete a canary, you might want to use `GetCanary` to display
the information about this canary. Make
note of the information returned by this operation so that you can delete these resources
after you delete the canary.

## Request Syntax

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[DeleteLambda](#API_DeleteCanary_RequestSyntax)**

is `false`.

Your setting for this parameter is used only if the canary doesn't have `AUTOMATIC` for its

Lambda functions and layers will be deleted when this canary is deleted.
