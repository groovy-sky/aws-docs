# DecreaseNodeGroupsInGlobalReplicationGroup

Decreases the number of node groups in a Global datastore

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**ApplyImmediately**

Indicates that the shard reconfiguration process begins immediately. At present, the
only permitted value for this parameter is true.

Type: Boolean

Required: Yes

**GlobalReplicationGroupId**

The name of the Global datastore

Type: String

Required: Yes

**NodeGroupCount**

The number of node groups (shards) that results from the modification of the shard
configuration

Type: Integer

Required: Yes

**GlobalNodeGroupsToRemove.GlobalNodeGroupId.N**

If the value of NodeGroupCount is less than the current number of node groups
(shards), then either NodeGroupsToRemove or NodeGroupsToRetain is required.
GlobalNodeGroupsToRemove is a list of NodeGroupIds to remove from the cluster.
ElastiCache will attempt to remove all node groups listed by
GlobalNodeGroupsToRemove from the cluster.

Type: Array of strings

Required: No

**GlobalNodeGroupsToRetain.GlobalNodeGroupId.N**

If the value of NodeGroupCount is less than the current number of node groups
(shards), then either NodeGroupsToRemove or NodeGroupsToRetain is required.
GlobalNodeGroupsToRetain is a list of NodeGroupIds to retain from the cluster.
ElastiCache will attempt to retain all node groups listed by
GlobalNodeGroupsToRetain from the cluster.

Type: Array of strings

Required: No

## Response Elements

The following element is returned by the service.

**GlobalReplicationGroup**

Consists of a primary cluster that accepts writes and an associated secondary cluster
that resides in a different Amazon region. The secondary cluster accepts only reads. The
primary cluster automatically replicates updates to the secondary cluster.

- The **GlobalReplicationGroupIdSuffix** represents
the name of the Global datastore, which is what you use to associate a secondary
cluster.

Type: [GlobalReplicationGroup](api-globalreplicationgroup.md) object
