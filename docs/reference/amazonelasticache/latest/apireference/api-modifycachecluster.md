# ModifyCacheCluster

Modifies the settings for a cluster. You can use this operation to change one or more
cluster configuration parameters by specifying the parameters and the new values.

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**CacheClusterId**

The cluster identifier. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**ApplyImmediately**

If `true`, this parameter causes the modifications in this request and any
pending modifications to be applied, asynchronously and as soon as possible, regardless
of the `PreferredMaintenanceWindow` setting for the cluster.

If `false`, changes to the cluster are applied on the next maintenance
reboot, or the next failure reboot, whichever occurs first.

###### Important

If you perform a `ModifyCacheCluster` before a pending modification is
applied, the pending modification is replaced by the newer modification.

Valid values: `true` \| `false`

Default: `false`

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**AuthToken**

Reserved parameter. The password used to access a password protected server. This
parameter must be specified with the `auth-token-update` parameter. Password
constraints:

- Must be only printable ASCII characters

- Must be at least 16 characters and no more than 128 characters in
length

- Cannot contain any of the following characters: '/', '"', or '@', '%'

For more information, see AUTH password at [AUTH](http://redis.io/commands/AUTH).

Type: String

Required: No

**AuthTokenUpdateStrategy**

Specifies the strategy to use to update the AUTH token. This parameter must be
specified with the `auth-token` parameter. Possible values:

- ROTATE - default, if no update strategy is provided

- SET - allowed only after ROTATE

- DELETE - allowed only when transitioning to RBAC

For more information, see [Authenticating Users with AUTH](../../../../services/amazonelasticache/latest/dg/auth.md)

Type: String

Valid Values: `SET | ROTATE | DELETE`

Required: No

**AutoMinorVersionUpgrade**

If you are running Valkey 7.2 or Redis OSS engine version 6.0 or later, set this parameter to yes
to opt-in to the next auto minor version upgrade campaign. This parameter is
disabled for previous versions.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**AZMode**

Specifies whether the new nodes in this Memcached cluster are all created in a single
Availability Zone or created across multiple Availability Zones.

Valid values: `single-az` \| `cross-az`.

This option is only supported for Memcached clusters.

###### Note

You cannot specify `single-az` if the Memcached cluster already has
cache nodes in different Availability Zones. If `cross-az` is specified,
existing Memcached nodes remain in their current Availability Zone.

Only newly created nodes are located in different Availability Zones.

Type: String

Valid Values: `single-az | cross-az`

Required: No

**CacheNodeIdsToRemove.CacheNodeId.N**

A list of cache node IDs to be removed. A node ID is a numeric identifier (0001, 0002,
etc.). This parameter is only valid when `NumCacheNodes` is less than the
existing number of cache nodes. The number of cache node IDs supplied in this parameter
must match the difference between the existing number of cache nodes in the cluster or
pending cache nodes, whichever is greater, and the value of `NumCacheNodes`
in the request.

For example: If you have 3 active cache nodes, 7 pending cache nodes, and the number
of cache nodes in this `ModifyCacheCluster` call is 5, you must list 2 (7 -
5) cache node IDs to remove.

Type: Array of strings

Required: No

**CacheNodeType**

A valid cache node type that you want to scale this cluster up to.

Type: String

Required: No

**CacheParameterGroupName**

The name of the cache parameter group to apply to this cluster. This change is
asynchronously applied as soon as possible for parameters when the
`ApplyImmediately` parameter is specified as `true` for this
request.

Type: String

Required: No

**CacheSecurityGroupNames.CacheSecurityGroupName.N**

A list of cache security group names to authorize on this cluster. This change is
asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

You can use this parameter only with clusters that are created outside of an Amazon
Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

Constraints: Must contain no more than 255 alphanumeric characters. Must not be
"Default".

Type: Array of strings

Required: No

**Engine**

The engine type used by the cache cluster. The options are valkey, memcached or redis.

Type: String

Required: No

**EngineVersion**

The upgraded version of the cache engine to be run on the cache nodes.

**Important:** You can upgrade to a newer engine version
(see [Selecting\
a Cache Engine and Version](../../../../services/amazonelasticache/latest/dg/selectengine.md#VersionManagement)), but you cannot downgrade to an earlier engine
version. If you want to use an earlier engine version, you must delete the existing
cluster and create it anew with the earlier engine version.

Type: String

Required: No

**IpDiscovery**

The network type you choose when modifying a cluster, either `ipv4` \|
`ipv6`. IPv6 is supported for workloads using Valkey 7.2 and above, Redis OSS engine version 6.2
to 7.1 or Memcached engine version 1.6.6 and above on all instances built on the [Nitro system](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro).

Type: String

Valid Values: `ipv4 | ipv6`

Required: No

**LogDeliveryConfigurations.LogDeliveryConfigurationRequest.N**

Specifies the destination, format and type of the logs.

Type: Array of [LogDeliveryConfigurationRequest](api-logdeliveryconfigurationrequest.md) objects

Required: No

**NewAvailabilityZones.PreferredAvailabilityZone.N**

###### Note

This option is only supported on Memcached clusters.

The list of Availability Zones where the new Memcached cache nodes are created.

This parameter is only valid when `NumCacheNodes` in the request is greater
than the sum of the number of active cache nodes and the number of cache nodes pending
creation (which may be zero). The number of Availability Zones supplied in this list
must match the cache nodes being added in this request.

Scenarios:

- **Scenario 1:** You have 3 active nodes and wish
to add 2 nodes. Specify `NumCacheNodes=5` (3 + 2) and optionally
specify two Availability Zones for the two new nodes.

- **Scenario 2:** You have 3 active nodes and 2
nodes pending creation (from the scenario 1 call) and want to add 1 more node.
Specify `NumCacheNodes=6` ((3 + 2) + 1) and optionally specify an
Availability Zone for the new node.

- **Scenario 3:** You want to cancel all pending
operations. Specify `NumCacheNodes=3` to cancel all pending
operations.

The Availability Zone placement of nodes pending creation cannot be modified. If you
wish to cancel any nodes pending creation, add 0 nodes by setting
`NumCacheNodes` to the number of current nodes.

If `cross-az` is specified, existing Memcached nodes remain in their
current Availability Zone. Only newly created nodes can be located in different
Availability Zones. For guidance on how to move existing Memcached nodes to different
Availability Zones, see the **Availability Zone**
**Considerations** section of [Cache Node\
Considerations for Memcached](../../../../services/amazonelasticache/latest/dg/cachenodes-supportedtypes.md).

**Impact of new add/remove requests upon pending requests**

- Scenario-1

- Pending Action: Delete

- New Request: Delete

- Result: The new delete, pending or immediate, replaces the pending
delete.

- Scenario-2

- Pending Action: Delete

- New Request: Create

- Result: The new create, pending or immediate, replaces the pending
delete.

- Scenario-3

- Pending Action: Create

- New Request: Delete

- Result: The new delete, pending or immediate, replaces the pending
create.

- Scenario-4

- Pending Action: Create

- New Request: Create

- Result: The new create is added to the pending create.

###### Important

**Important:** If the new create
request is **Apply Immediately - Yes**,
all creates are performed immediately. If the new create request is
**Apply Immediately - No**, all
creates are pending.

Type: Array of strings

Required: No

**NotificationTopicArn**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to which notifications are
sent.

###### Note

The Amazon SNS topic owner must be same as the cluster owner.

Type: String

Required: No

**NotificationTopicStatus**

The status of the Amazon SNS notification topic. Notifications are sent only if the
status is `active`.

Valid values: `active` \| `inactive`

Type: String

Required: No

**NumCacheNodes**

The number of cache nodes that the cluster should have. If the value for
`NumCacheNodes` is greater than the sum of the number of current cache
nodes and the number of cache nodes pending creation (which may be zero), more nodes are
added. If the value is less than the number of existing cache nodes, nodes are removed.
If the value is equal to the number of current cache nodes, any pending add or remove
requests are canceled.

If you are removing cache nodes, you must use the `CacheNodeIdsToRemove`
parameter to provide the IDs of the specific cache nodes to remove.

For clusters running Valkey or Redis OSS, this value must be 1. For clusters running Memcached, this
value must be between 1 and 40.

###### Note

Adding or removing Memcached cache nodes can be applied immediately or as a
pending operation (see `ApplyImmediately`).

A pending operation to modify the number of cache nodes in a cluster during its
maintenance window, whether by adding or removing nodes in accordance with the scale
out architecture, is not queued. The customer's latest request to add or remove
nodes to the cluster overrides any previous pending operations to modify the number
of cache nodes in the cluster. For example, a request to remove 2 nodes would
override a previous pending operation to remove 3 nodes. Similarly, a request to add
2 nodes would override a previous pending operation to remove 3 nodes and vice
versa. As Memcached cache nodes may now be provisioned in different Availability
Zones with flexible cache node placement, a request to add nodes does not
automatically override a previous pending operation to add nodes. The customer can
modify the previous pending operation to add more nodes or explicitly cancel the
pending request and retry the new request. To cancel pending operations to modify
the number of cache nodes in a cluster, use the `ModifyCacheCluster`
request and set `NumCacheNodes` equal to the number of cache nodes
currently in the cluster.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**PreferredMaintenanceWindow**

Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on the cluster is performed.
It is specified as a range in the format ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). The
minimum maintenance window is a 60 minute period.

Valid values for `ddd` are:

- `sun`

- `mon`

- `tue`

- `wed`

- `thu`

- `fri`

- `sat`

Example: `sun:23:00-mon:01:30`

Type: String

Required: No

**ScaleConfig**

Configures horizontal or vertical scaling for Memcached clusters, specifying the scaling percentage and interval.

Type: [ScaleConfig](api-scaleconfig.md) object

Required: No

**SecurityGroupIds.SecurityGroupId.N**

Specifies the VPC Security Groups associated with the cluster.

This parameter can be used only with clusters that are created in an Amazon Virtual
Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

Type: Array of strings

Required: No

**SnapshotRetentionLimit**

The number of days for which ElastiCache retains automatic cluster snapshots before
deleting them. For example, if you set `SnapshotRetentionLimit` to 5, a
snapshot that was taken today is retained for 5 days before being deleted.

###### Note

If the value of `SnapshotRetentionLimit` is set to zero (0), backups
are turned off.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**SnapshotWindow**

The daily time range (in UTC) during which ElastiCache begins taking a daily snapshot
of your cluster.

Type: String

Required: No
