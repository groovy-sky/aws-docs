# DeleteGlobalReplicationGroup

Deleting a Global datastore is a two-step process:

- First, you must [DisassociateGlobalReplicationGroup](api-disassociateglobalreplicationgroup.md) to remove
the secondary clusters in the Global datastore.

- Once the Global datastore contains only the primary cluster, you can use the
`DeleteGlobalReplicationGroup` API to delete the Global datastore
while retainining the primary cluster using
`RetainPrimaryReplicationGroup=true`.

Since the Global Datastore has only a primary cluster, you can delete the Global
Datastore while retaining the primary by setting
`RetainPrimaryReplicationGroup=true`. The primary cluster is never
deleted when deleting a Global Datastore. It can only be deleted when it no longer is
associated with any Global Datastore.

When you receive a successful response from this operation, Amazon ElastiCache
immediately begins deleting the selected resources; you cannot cancel or revert this
operation.

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**GlobalReplicationGroupId**

The name of the Global datastore

Type: String

Required: Yes

**RetainPrimaryReplicationGroup**

The primary replication group is retained as a standalone replication group.

Type: Boolean

Required: Yes

## Response Elements

The following element is returned by the service.

**GlobalReplicationGroup**

Consists of a primary cluster that accepts writes and an associated secondary cluster
that resides in a different Amazon region. The secondary cluster accepts only reads. The
primary cluster automatically replicates updates to the secondary cluster.

- The **GlobalReplicationGroupIdSuffix** represents
the name of the Global datastore, which is what you use to associate a secondary
cluster.

Type: [GlobalReplicationGroup](api-globalreplicationgroup.md) object

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**GlobalReplicationGroupNotFoundFault**

The Global datastore does not exist

HTTP Status Code: 404

**InvalidGlobalReplicationGroupState**

The Global datastore is not available or in primary-only state.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InvalidParameterValue**

The value for a parameter is invalid.

**message**
