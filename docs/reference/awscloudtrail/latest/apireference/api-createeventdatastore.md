## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[AdvancedEventSelectors](#API_CreateEventDataStore_RequestSyntax)**

The advanced event selectors to use to select the events for the data store. You can
configure up to five advanced event selectors for each event data store.

For more information about how to use advanced event selectors to log CloudTrail
events, see [Log events by using advanced event selectors](../../../../services/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.md#creating-data-event-selectors-advanced) in the CloudTrail User Guide.

For more information about how to use advanced event selectors to include AWS Config configuration items in your event data store, see [Create an event data store for AWS Config configuration\
items](../../../../services/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/lake-eds-cli.md#lake-cli-create-eds-config) in the CloudTrail User Guide.

For more information about how to use advanced event selectors to include events outside of AWS events in your event data store, see [Create an integration to log events from outside AWS](../../../../services/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/lake-integrations-cli.md#lake-cli-create-integration) in the CloudTrail User Guide.

Type: Array of [AdvancedEventSelector](api-advancedeventselector.md) objects

Required: No

**[BillingMode](#API_CreateEventDataStore_RequestSyntax)**

The billing mode for the event data store determines the cost for ingesting events and the default and maximum retention period for the event data store.

The following are the possible values:

- `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING` \- This billing mode is generally recommended if you want a flexible retention period of up to 3653 days (about 10 years).
The default retention period for this billing mode is 366 days.

- `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING` \- This billing mode is recommended if you expect to ingest more than 25 TB of event data per month and need a retention period of up to 2557 days (about 7 years).
The default retention period for this billing mode is 2557 days.

The default value is `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING`.

For more information about CloudTrail pricing,
see [AWS CloudTrail Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing) and
[Managing CloudTrail Lake costs](../../../../services/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-lake-manage-costs.md).

Type: String

Valid Values: `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING | FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING`

Required: No

**[KmsKeyId](#API_CreateEventDataStore_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the AWS KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered by
CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by `alias/`, a
fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique
identifier.

###### Important

Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing CloudTrail
permissions on the key, prevents CloudTrail from logging events to the event data
store, and prevents users from querying the data in the event data store that was
encrypted with the key. After you associate an event data store with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be removed or changed. Before you
disable or delete a KMS key that you are using with an event data store,
delete or back up your event data store.

CloudTrail also supports AWS KMS multi-Region keys. For more
information about multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region\
keys](../../../../services/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.md) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

Examples:

- `alias/MyAliasName`

- `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName`

- `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`

- `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 350.

Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9._/\-:]+$`

Required: No

**[MultiRegionEnabled](#API_CreateEventDataStore_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies whether the event data store includes events from all Regions, or only from
the Region in which the event data store is created.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[Name](#API_CreateEventDataStore_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the event data store.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 3. Maximum length of 128.

Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9._\-]+$`

Required: Yes

**[OrganizationEnabled](#API_CreateEventDataStore_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies whether an event data store collects events logged for an organization in
AWS Organizations.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[RetentionPeriod](#API_CreateEventDataStore_RequestSyntax)**

The retention period of the event data store, in days. If `BillingMode` is set to `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING`, you can set a retention period of
up to 3653 days, the equivalent of 10 years. If `BillingMode` is set to `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING`, you can set a retention period of
up to 2557 days, the equivalent of seven years.

CloudTrail Lake determines whether to retain an event by checking if the `eventTime`
of the event is within the specified retention period. For example, if you set a retention period of 90 days, CloudTrail will remove events
when the `eventTime` is older than 90 days.

###### Note

If you plan to copy trail events to this event data store, we recommend
that you consider both the age of the events that you
want to copy as well as how long you want to keep the copied events
in your event data store. For example, if you copy trail events that are 5 years old
and specify a retention period of 7 years, the event data store
will retain those events for two years.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 7. Maximum value of 3653.

Required: No

**[StartIngestion](#API_CreateEventDataStore_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies whether the event data store should start ingesting live events. The default is true.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[TagsList](#API_CreateEventDataStore_RequestSyntax)**

A list of tags.

Type: Array of [Tag](api-tag.md) objects

Array Members: Maximum number of 200 items.
