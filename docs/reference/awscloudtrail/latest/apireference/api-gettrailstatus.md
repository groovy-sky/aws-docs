# GetTrailStatus

Returns a JSON-formatted list of information about the specified trail. Fields include
information on delivery errors, Amazon SNS and Amazon S3 errors, and start
and stop logging times for each trail. This operation returns trail status from a single
Region. To return trail status from all Regions, you must call the operation on each
Region.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "Name": "string"
}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[Name](#API_GetTrailStatus_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the name or the CloudTrail ARN of the trail for which you are
requesting status. To get the status of a shadow trail (a replication of the trail in
another Region), you must specify its ARN.

The following is the format of a trail
ARN: `arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail`

###### Note

If the trail is an organization trail and you are a member account in the organization in AWS Organizations, you must provide the full ARN of that trail, and not just the name.

Type: String

Required: Yes
