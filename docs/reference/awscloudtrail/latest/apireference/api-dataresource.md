# DataResource

You can configure the `DataResource` in an `EventSelector` to log data events for the following three resource types:

- `AWS::DynamoDB::Table`

- `AWS::Lambda::Function`

- `AWS::S3::Object`

To log data events for all other resource types including objects stored in
[directory buckets](../../../../services/s3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-overview.md), you must use [AdvancedEventSelectors](api-advancedeventselector.md). You must also
use `AdvancedEventSelectors` if you want to filter on the `eventName` field.

Configure the `DataResource` to specify the resource type and resource ARNs for which you want to log data events.

###### Note

The total number of allowed data resources is 250. This number can be distributed
between 1 and 5 event selectors, but the total cannot exceed 250 across all
selectors for the trail.

The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of all
data events for a general purpose bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`. In this example, the CloudTrail user specified an empty prefix, and the option to log both `Read`
and `Write` data events.

1. A user uploads an image file to `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`.

2. The `PutObject` API operation is an Amazon S3 object-level API.
    It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail
    user specified an S3 bucket with an empty prefix, events that occur on any object in
    that bucket are logged. The trail processes and logs the event.

3. A user uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named
    `arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`.

4. The `PutObject` API operation occurred for an object in an S3 bucket
    that the CloudTrail user didn't specify for the trail. The trail doesn’t log
    the event.

The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of
AWS Lambda data events for a Lambda function named
_MyLambdaFunction_, but not for all Lambda
functions.

1. A user runs a script that includes a call to the
    _MyLambdaFunction_ function and the
    _MyOtherLambdaFunction_ function.

2. The `Invoke` API operation on _MyLambdaFunction_ is
    an Lambda API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail.
    Because the CloudTrail user specified logging data events for
    _MyLambdaFunction_, any invocations of that function are
    logged. The trail processes and logs the event.

3. The `Invoke` API operation on
    _MyOtherLambdaFunction_ is an Lambda API. Because
    the CloudTrail user did not specify logging data events for all Lambda functions, the `Invoke` operation for
    _MyOtherLambdaFunction_ does not match the function specified
    for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event.

## Contents

**Type**

The resource type in which you want to log data events. You can specify the following
_basic_ event selector resource types:

- `AWS::DynamoDB::Table`

- `AWS::Lambda::Function`

- `AWS::S3::Object`

Additional resource types are available through _advanced_
event selectors. For more
information, see [AdvancedEventSelector](api-advancedeventselector.md).

Type: String

Required: No

**Values**

An array of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) strings or partial ARN strings for the specified
resource type.

- To log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets in your AWS account, specify the prefix as `arn:aws:s3`.

###### Note

This also enables logging of data event activity performed by any user or role
in your AWS account, even if that activity is performed on a bucket
that belongs to another AWS account.

- To log data events for all objects in an S3 bucket, specify the bucket and an
empty object prefix such as `arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/`. The trail logs data
events for all objects in this S3 bucket.

- To log data events for specific objects, specify the S3 bucket and object prefix
such as `arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/example-images`. The trail logs data events
for objects in this S3 bucket that match the prefix.

- To log data events for all Lambda functions in your AWS account, specify the prefix as `arn:aws:lambda`.

###### Note

This also enables logging of `Invoke` activity performed by any user
or role in your AWS account, even if that activity is performed on
a function that belongs to another AWS account.

- To log data events for a specific Lambda function, specify the
function ARN.

###### Note

Lambda function ARNs are exact. For example, if you specify a
function ARN
_arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld_,
data events will only be logged for
_arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld_.
They will not be logged for
_arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld2_.

- To log data events for all DynamoDB tables in your AWS account, specify the prefix as `arn:aws:dynamodb`.

Type: Array of strings

Required: No
