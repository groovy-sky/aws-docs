# UpdateTrail

Updates trail settings that control what events you are logging, and how to handle log
files. Changes to a trail do not require stopping the CloudTrail service. Use this
action to designate an existing bucket for log delivery. If the existing bucket has
previously been a target for CloudTrail log files, an IAM policy
exists for the bucket. `UpdateTrail` must be called from the Region in which the
trail was created; otherwise, an `InvalidHomeRegionException` is thrown.

}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn](#API_UpdateTrail_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a unique identifier that
represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs are delivered. You must use a log
group that exists in your account.

Not required unless you specify `CloudWatchLogsRoleArn`.

Type: String

Required: No

**[CloudWatchLogsRoleArn](#API_UpdateTrail_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume to write to a user's
log group. You must use a role that exists in your account.

Type: String

Required: No

**[EnableLogFileValidation](#API_UpdateTrail_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies whether log file validation is enabled. The default is false.

###### Note

When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of digest files is broken
after one hour. CloudTrail does not create digest files for log files that were
delivered during a period in which log file integrity validation was disabled. For
example, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on January 1, disable it at
noon on January 2, and re-enable it at noon on January 10, digest files will not be
created for the log files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon on January 10. The
same applies whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or delete a trail.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[IncludeGlobalServiceEvents](#API_UpdateTrail_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies whether the trail is publishing events from global services such as IAM to the log files.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[IsMultiRegionTrail](#API_UpdateTrail_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies whether the trail applies only to the current Region or to all Regions. The
default is false. If the trail exists only in the current Region and this value is set to
true, shadow trails (replications of the trail) will be created in the other Regions. If
the trail exists in all Regions and this value is set to false, the trail will remain in
the Region where it was created, and its shadow trails in other Regions will be deleted. As
a best practice, consider using trails that log events in all Regions.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[IsOrganizationTrail](#API_UpdateTrail_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies whether the trail is applied to all accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations, or only for the current AWS account. The default is false,
and cannot be true unless the call is made on behalf of an AWS account that
is the management account for an organization in AWS Organizations. If the trail is not an organization trail and this is set to
`true`, the trail will be created in all AWS accounts that
belong to the organization. If the trail is an organization trail and this is set to
`false`, the trail will remain in the current AWS account but
be deleted from all member accounts in the organization.

###### Note

Only the management account for the organization can convert an organization trail to a non-organization trail, or convert a non-organization trail to
an organization trail.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[KmsKeyId](#API_UpdateTrail_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the AWS KMS key ID to use to encrypt the logs and digest files delivered by CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by "alias/", a fully specified ARN to
an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.

CloudTrail also supports AWS KMS multi-Region keys. For more
information about multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region\
keys](../../../../services/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.md) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

- 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

Type: String

Required: No

**[Name](#API_UpdateTrail_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If `Name` is a trail name, the
string must meet the following requirements:

- Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.), underscores
(\_), or dashes (-)

- Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number

- Be between 3 and 128 characters

- Have no adjacent periods, underscores or dashes. Names like
`my-_namespace` and `my--namespace` are not valid.

- Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)

If `Name` is a trail ARN, it must be in the following format.

`arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail`

Type: String

Required: Yes

**[S3BucketName](#API_UpdateTrail_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing log files.
See [Amazon S3\
Bucket naming rules](../../../../services/s3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.md).

Type: String

Required: No

**[S3KeyPrefix](#API_UpdateTrail_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the bucket you
have designated for log file delivery. For more information, see [Finding Your CloudTrail Log Files](../../../../services/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/get-and-view-cloudtrail-log-files.md#cloudtrail-find-log-files). The maximum length is 200
characters.

Type: String

Required: No

**[SnsTopicName](#API_UpdateTrail_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the name or ARN of the Amazon SNS topic defined for notification of log file
delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.
