# LookupEvents

Looks up [management events](../../../../services/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.md#cloudtrail-concepts-management-events) or [CloudTrail Insights events](../../../../services/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.md#cloudtrail-concepts-insights-events) that are captured by CloudTrail.
You can look up events that occurred in a Region within the last 90 days.

###### Note

`LookupEvents` returns recent Insights events for trails that enable Insights. To view Insights events for an event data store, you can run queries on your
Insights event data store, and you can also view the Lake dashboard for Insights.

Lookup supports the following attributes for management events:

- AWS access key

- Event ID

- Event name

- Event source

- Read only

- Resource name

- Resource type

- User name

Lookup supports the following attributes for Insights events:

- Event ID

- Event name

- Event source

All attributes are optional. The default number of results returned is 50, with a
maximum of 50 possible. The response includes a token that you can use to get the next page
of results.

###### Important

The rate of lookup requests is limited to two per second, per account, per Region. If
this limit is exceeded, a throttling error occurs.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "EndTime": number,
   "EventCategory": "string",
   "LookupAttributes": [
      {
         "AttributeKey": "string",
         "AttributeValue": "string"
      }
   ],
   "MaxResults": number,
   "NextToken": "string",
   "StartTime": number
}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[EndTime](#API_LookupEvents_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies that only events that occur before or at the specified time are returned. If
the specified end time is before the specified start time, an error is returned.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**[EventCategory](#API_LookupEvents_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the event category. If you do not specify an event category, events of the
category are not returned in the response. For example, if you do not specify
`insight` as the value of `EventCategory`, no Insights events are
returned.

Type: String

Valid Values: `insight`

Required: No

**[LookupAttributes](#API_LookupEvents_RequestSyntax)**

Contains a list of lookup attributes. Currently the list can contain only one
item.

Type: Array of [LookupAttribute](api-lookupattribute.md) objects

Required: No

**[MaxResults](#API_LookupEvents_RequestSyntax)**

The number of events to return. Possible values are 1 through 50. The default is
50.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 50.

Required: No

**[NextToken](#API_LookupEvents_RequestSyntax)**

The token to use to get the next page of results after a previous API call. This token
must be passed in with the same parameters that were specified in the original call. For
example, if the original call specified an AttributeKey of 'Username' with a value of
'root', the call with NextToken should include those same parameters.

Type: String

Required: No

**[StartTime](#API_LookupEvents_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies that only events that occur after or at the specified time are returned. If
the specified start time is after the specified end time, an error is returned.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

         "CloudTrailEvent": "string",
         "EventId": "string",
         "EventName": "string",
         "EventSource": "string",
         "EventTime": number,
         "ReadOnly": "string",
         "Resources": [
            {
               "ResourceName": "string",
               "ResourceType": "string"

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[Events](#API_LookupEvents_ResponseSyntax)**

A list of events returned based on the lookup attributes specified and the CloudTrail event. The events list is sorted by time. The most recent event is listed
first.

Type: Array of [Event](api-event.md) objects

**[NextToken](#API_LookupEvents_ResponseSyntax)**

The token to use to get the next page of results after a previous API call. If the token
does not appear, there are no more results to return. The token must be passed in with the
same parameters as the previous call. For example, if the original call specified an
AttributeKey of 'Username' with a value of 'root', the call with NextToken should include
those same parameters.
