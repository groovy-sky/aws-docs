# Initialize the Amazon Connect SDK in your application for Amazon Connect Agent Workspace

Initializing the [Amazon Connect SDK](https://github.com/amazon-connect/AmazonConnectSDK)
in your app for the Amazon Connect agent workspace requires calling `init` on
the AmazonConnectApp module. This takes an `onCreate` and `onDestroy`
callback, which will be invoked once the app has successfully initialized in the
agent workspace and then when the agent workspace is going to destroy the iframe the
app is running in. These are two of the lifecycle events that your app can integrate
with. See [Application lifecycle events in Amazon Connect Agent Workspace](../../../../services/agentworkspace/latest/devguide/integrating-with-agent-workspace-lifecycle-events.md) for details
on the other app lifecycle events that your app can hook into.

```json

import { AmazonConnectApp } from "@amazon-connect/app";

const { provider } = AmazonConnectApp.init({
  onCreate: (event) => {
    const { appInstanceId } = event.context;
    console.log('App initialized: ', appInstanceId);
  },
  onDestroy: (event) => {
    console.log('App being destroyed');
  },
});

```

###### Note

Keep the reference to `{ provider }` which is required to create
clients to interact with events and requests.

Doing a quick test locally by loading your app directly will produce an error
message in the browser dev tools console that the app was unable to establish a
connection to the workspace. This will happen when your app is correctly calling `
                init` when run outside of the workspace.
