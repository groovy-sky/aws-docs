# Action

An action defines the tasks that the extension performs during the AWS AppConfig
workflow. Each action includes an action point, as shown in the following list:

- `PRE_CREATE_HOSTED_CONFIGURATION_VERSION`

- `PRE_START_DEPLOYMENT`

- `AT_DEPLOYMENT_TICK`

- `ON_DEPLOYMENT_START`

- `ON_DEPLOYMENT_STEP`

- `ON_DEPLOYMENT_BAKING`

- `ON_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE`

- `ON_DEPLOYMENT_ROLLED_BACK`

Each action also includes a name, a URI to an AWS Lambda function, and an
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an AWS Identity and Access Management assume role. You specify the name,
URI, and ARN for each _action point_ defined in the extension.
