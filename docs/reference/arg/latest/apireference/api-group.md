# Group

A resource group that contains AWS resources. You can assign resources to the group
by associating either of the following elements with the group:

- [ResourceQuery](api-resourcequery.md) \- Use a resource query to specify a set of tag
keys and values. All resources in the same AWS Region and AWS account that
have those keys with the same values are included in the group. You can add a
resource query when you create the group, or later by using the [PutGroupConfiguration](api-putgroupconfiguration.md) operation.

- [GroupConfiguration](api-groupconfiguration.md) \- Use a service configuration to
associate the group with an AWS service. The configuration specifies which
resource types can be included in the group.
