# UndeprecateDomain

Undeprecates a previously deprecated domain. After a domain has been undeprecated it can be used
to create new workflow executions or register new types.

###### Note

This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not
exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as
follows:

- Use a `Resource` element with the domain name to limit the action to
only specified domains.

- Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this
action.

- You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the
parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated
event attribute's `cause` parameter is set to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`.
For details and example IAM policies, see [Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF\
Workflows](../../../../services/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.md) in the _Amazon SWF Developer Guide_.
