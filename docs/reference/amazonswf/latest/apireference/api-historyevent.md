# HistoryEvent
<a name="API_HistoryEvent"></a>

Event within a workflow execution. A history event can be one of these types:
+  `ActivityTaskCancelRequested` – A `RequestCancelActivityTask` decision was received by the system.
+  `ActivityTaskCanceled` – The activity task was successfully canceled.
+  `ActivityTaskCompleted` – An activity worker successfully completed an activity task by calling [RespondActivityTaskCompleted](API_RespondActivityTaskCompleted.md).
+  `ActivityTaskFailed` – An activity worker failed an activity task by calling [RespondActivityTaskFailed](API_RespondActivityTaskFailed.md).
+  `ActivityTaskScheduled` – An activity task was scheduled for execution.
+  `ActivityTaskStarted` – The scheduled activity task was dispatched to a worker.
+  `ActivityTaskTimedOut` – The activity task timed out.
+  `CancelTimerFailed` – Failed to process CancelTimer decision. This happens when the decision isn't configured properly, for example no timer exists with the specified timer Id.
+  `CancelWorkflowExecutionFailed` – A request to cancel a workflow execution failed.
+  `ChildWorkflowExecutionCanceled` – A child workflow execution, started by this workflow execution, was canceled and closed.
+  `ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted` – A child workflow execution, started by this workflow execution, completed successfully and was closed.
+  `ChildWorkflowExecutionFailed` – A child workflow execution, started by this workflow execution, failed to complete successfully and was closed.
+  `ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted` – A child workflow execution was successfully started.
+  `ChildWorkflowExecutionTerminated` – A child workflow execution, started by this workflow execution, was terminated.
+  `ChildWorkflowExecutionTimedOut` – A child workflow execution, started by this workflow execution, timed out and was closed.
+  `CompleteWorkflowExecutionFailed` – The workflow execution failed to complete.
+  `ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionFailed` – The workflow execution failed to complete after being continued as a new workflow execution.
+  `DecisionTaskCompleted` – The decider successfully completed a decision task by calling [RespondDecisionTaskCompleted](API_RespondDecisionTaskCompleted.md).
+  `DecisionTaskScheduled` – A decision task was scheduled for the workflow execution.
+  `DecisionTaskStarted` – The decision task was dispatched to a decider.
+  `DecisionTaskTimedOut` – The decision task timed out.
+  `ExternalWorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` – Request to cancel an external workflow execution was successfully delivered to the target execution.
+  `ExternalWorkflowExecutionSignaled` – A signal, requested by this workflow execution, was successfully delivered to the target external workflow execution.
+  `FailWorkflowExecutionFailed` – A request to mark a workflow execution as failed, itself failed.
+  `MarkerRecorded` – A marker was recorded in the workflow history as the result of a `RecordMarker` decision.
+  `RecordMarkerFailed` – A `RecordMarker` decision was returned as failed.
+  `RequestCancelActivityTaskFailed` – Failed to process RequestCancelActivityTask decision. This happens when the decision isn't configured properly.
+  `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed` – Request to cancel an external workflow execution failed.
+  `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated` – A request was made to request the cancellation of an external workflow execution.
+  `ScheduleActivityTaskFailed` – Failed to process ScheduleActivityTask decision. This happens when the decision isn't configured properly, for example the activity type specified isn't registered.
+  `SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed` – The request to signal an external workflow execution failed.
+  `SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated` – A request to signal an external workflow was made.
+  `StartActivityTaskFailed` – A scheduled activity task failed to start.
+  `StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed` – Failed to process StartChildWorkflowExecution decision. This happens when the decision isn't configured properly, for example the workflow type specified isn't registered.
+  `StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated` – A request was made to start a child workflow execution.
+  `StartTimerFailed` – Failed to process StartTimer decision. This happens when the decision isn't configured properly, for example a timer already exists with the specified timer Id.
+  `TimerCanceled` – A timer, previously started for this workflow execution, was successfully canceled.
+  `TimerFired` – A timer, previously started for this workflow execution, fired.
+  `TimerStarted` – A timer was started for the workflow execution due to a `StartTimer` decision.
+  `WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` – A request to cancel this workflow execution was made.
+  `WorkflowExecutionCanceled` – The workflow execution was successfully canceled and closed.
+  `WorkflowExecutionCompleted` – The workflow execution was closed due to successful completion.
+  `WorkflowExecutionContinuedAsNew` – The workflow execution was closed and a new execution of the same type was created with the same workflowId.
+  `WorkflowExecutionFailed` – The workflow execution closed due to a failure.
+  `WorkflowExecutionSignaled` – An external signal was received for the workflow execution.
+  `WorkflowExecutionStarted` – The workflow execution was started.
+  `WorkflowExecutionTerminated` – The workflow execution was terminated.
+  `WorkflowExecutionTimedOut` – The workflow execution was closed because a time out was exceeded.
