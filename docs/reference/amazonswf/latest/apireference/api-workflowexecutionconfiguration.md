# WorkflowExecutionConfiguration
<a name="API_WorkflowExecutionConfiguration"></a>

The configuration settings for a workflow execution including timeout values, tasklist etc. These configuration settings are determined from the defaults specified when registering the workflow type and those specified when starting the workflow execution.

## Contents
<a name="API_WorkflowExecutionConfiguration_Contents"></a>

 ** childPolicy **   <a name="SWF-Type-WorkflowExecutionConfiguration-childPolicy"></a>
The policy to use for the child workflow executions if this workflow execution is terminated, by calling the [TerminateWorkflowExecution](API_TerminateWorkflowExecution.md) action explicitly or due to an expired timeout.
The supported child policies are:
+  `TERMINATE` – The child executions are terminated.
+  `REQUEST_CANCEL` – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a `WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.
+  `ABANDON` – No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.

 ** taskPriority **   <a name="SWF-Type-WorkflowExecutionConfiguration-taskPriority"></a>
The priority assigned to decision tasks for this workflow execution. Valid values are integers that range from Java's `Integer.MIN_VALUE` (-2147483648) to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate higher priority.
