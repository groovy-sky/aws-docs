# SignalWorkflowExecution

Records a `WorkflowExecutionSignaled` event in the workflow execution
history and creates a decision task for the workflow execution identified by the given domain,
workflowId and runId. The event is recorded with the specified user defined signalName and
input (if provided).

###### Note

If a runId isn't specified, then the `WorkflowExecutionSignaled` event is
recorded in the history of the current open workflow with the matching workflowId in the
domain.

###### Note

If the specified workflow execution isn't open, this method fails with
`UnknownResource`.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as
follows:

- Use a `Resource` element with the domain name to limit the action to
only specified domains.

- Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this
action.

- You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the
parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated
event attribute's `cause` parameter is set to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`.
For details and example IAM policies, see [Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF\
Workflows](../../../../services/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.md) in the _Amazon SWF Developer Guide_.

Returned when the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action.

**message**

A description that may help with diagnosing the cause of the fault.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**UnknownResourceFault**

Returned when the named resource cannot be found with in the scope of this operation (region or domain). This could happen if the named resource was never created or is no longer available for this operation.

**message**

A description that may help with diagnosing the cause of the fault.
