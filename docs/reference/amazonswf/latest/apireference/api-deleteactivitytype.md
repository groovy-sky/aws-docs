# DeleteActivityType
<a name="API_DeleteActivityType"></a>

Deletes the specified *activity type*.

Note: Prior to deletion, activity types must first be **deprecated**.

 After an activity type has been deleted, you cannot schedule new activities of that type. Activities that started before the type was deleted will continue to run.

 **Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:
+ Use a `Resource` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.
+ Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
+ Constrain the following parameters by using a `Condition` element with the appropriate keys.
  +  `activityType.name`: String constraint. The key is `swf:activityType.name`.
  +  `activityType.version`: String constraint. The key is `swf:activityType.version`.

If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's `cause` parameter is set to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`. For details and example IAM policies, see [Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html) in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.
