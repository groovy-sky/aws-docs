# CountClosedWorkflowExecutions
<a name="API_CountClosedWorkflowExecutions"></a>

Returns the number of closed workflow executions within the given domain that meet the specified filtering criteria.

**Note**
This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

 **Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:
+ Use a `Resource` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.
+ Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
+ Constrain the following parameters by using a `Condition` element with the appropriate keys.
  +  `tagFilter.tag`: String constraint. The key is `swf:tagFilter.tag`.
  +  `typeFilter.name`: String constraint. The key is `swf:typeFilter.name`.
  +  `typeFilter.version`: String constraint. The key is `swf:typeFilter.version`.

If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's `cause` parameter is set to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`. For details and example IAM policies, see [Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html) in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.

## Request Parameters
<a name="API_CountClosedWorkflowExecutions_RequestParameters"></a>

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](CommonParameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

 ** [closeStatusFilter](#API_CountClosedWorkflowExecutions_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="SWF-CountClosedWorkflowExecutions-request-closeStatusFilter"></a>
If specified, only workflow executions that match this close status are counted. This filter has an affect only if `executionStatus` is specified as `CLOSED`.
 `closeStatusFilter`, `executionFilter`, `typeFilter` and `tagFilter` are mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request.
Type: [CloseStatusFilter](API_CloseStatusFilter.md) object
Required: No

 ** [closeTimeFilter](#API_CountClosedWorkflowExecutions_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="SWF-CountClosedWorkflowExecutions-request-closeTimeFilter"></a>
If specified, only workflow executions that meet the close time criteria of the filter are counted.
 `startTimeFilter` and `closeTimeFilter` are mutually exclusive. You must specify one of these in a request but not both.
Type: [ExecutionTimeFilter](API_ExecutionTimeFilter.md) object
Required: No

 ** [domain](#API_CountClosedWorkflowExecutions_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="SWF-CountClosedWorkflowExecutions-request-domain"></a>
The name of the domain containing the workflow executions to count.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 256.
Required: Yes

 ** [executionFilter](#API_CountClosedWorkflowExecutions_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="SWF-CountClosedWorkflowExecutions-request-executionFilter"></a>
If specified, only workflow executions matching the `WorkflowId` in the filter are counted.
 `closeStatusFilter`, `executionFilter`, `typeFilter` and `tagFilter` are mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request.
Type: [WorkflowExecutionFilter](API_WorkflowExecutionFilter.md) object
Required: No

 ** [startTimeFilter](#API_CountClosedWorkflowExecutions_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="SWF-CountClosedWorkflowExecutions-request-startTimeFilter"></a>
If specified, only workflow executions that meet the start time criteria of the filter are counted.
 `startTimeFilter` and `closeTimeFilter` are mutually exclusive. You must specify one of these in a request but not both.
Type: [ExecutionTimeFilter](API_ExecutionTimeFilter.md) object
Required: No

 ** [tagFilter](#API_CountClosedWorkflowExecutions_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="SWF-CountClosedWorkflowExecutions-request-tagFilter"></a>
If specified, only executions that have a tag that matches the filter are counted.
 `closeStatusFilter`, `executionFilter`, `typeFilter` and `tagFilter` are mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request.
Type: [TagFilter](API_TagFilter.md) object
Required: No

 ** [typeFilter](#API_CountClosedWorkflowExecutions_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="SWF-CountClosedWorkflowExecutions-request-typeFilter"></a>
If specified, indicates the type of the workflow executions to be counted.
 `closeStatusFilter`, `executionFilter`, `typeFilter` and `tagFilter` are mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request.

## Response Elements
<a name="API_CountClosedWorkflowExecutions_ResponseElements"></a>

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

 ** [count](#API_CountClosedWorkflowExecutions_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="SWF-CountClosedWorkflowExecutions-response-count"></a>
The number of workflow executions.
Type: Integer
Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.

 ** [truncated](#API_CountClosedWorkflowExecutions_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="SWF-CountClosedWorkflowExecutions-response-truncated"></a>
If set to true, indicates that the actual count was more than the maximum supported by this API and the count returned is the truncated value.
Type: Boolean
