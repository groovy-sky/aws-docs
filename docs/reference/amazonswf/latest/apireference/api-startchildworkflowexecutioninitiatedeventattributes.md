## Contents
<a name="API_StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiatedEventAttributes_Contents"></a>

 ** childPolicy **   <a name="SWF-Type-StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiatedEventAttributes-childPolicy"></a>
The policy to use for the child workflow executions if this execution gets terminated by explicitly calling the [TerminateWorkflowExecution](API_TerminateWorkflowExecution.md) action or due to an expired timeout.
The supported child policies are:
+  `TERMINATE` – The child executions are terminated.
+  `REQUEST_CANCEL` – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a `WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.
+  `ABANDON` – No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.
