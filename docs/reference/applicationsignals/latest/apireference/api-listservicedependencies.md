Returns a list of service dependencies of the service that you specify. A dependency is an infrastructure
component that an operation of this service connects with. Dependencies can include AWS
services, AWS resources, and third-party services.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

POST /service-dependencies?EndTime=EndTime&MaxResults=MaxResults&NextToken=NextToken&StartTime=StartTime HTTP/1.1
Content-type: application/json

{
   "KeyAttributes": {
      "string" : "string"
   }
}
```

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[EndTime](#API_ListServiceDependencies_RequestSyntax)**

The end of the time period to retrieve information about. When used in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as
be epoch time in seconds. For example: `1698778057`

Your requested end time will be rounded to the nearest hour.

Required: Yes

**[MaxResults](#API_ListServiceDependencies_RequestSyntax)**

The maximum number of results to return in one operation. If you omit this
parameter, the default of 50 is used.

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 100.

**[NextToken](#API_ListServiceDependencies_RequestSyntax)**

Include this value, if it was returned by the previous operation, to get the next set of service dependencies.

**[StartTime](#API_ListServiceDependencies_RequestSyntax)**

The start of the time period to retrieve information about. When used in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as
be epoch time in seconds. For example: `1698778057`

Your requested start time will be rounded to the nearest hour.

Required: Yes

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[KeyAttributes](#API_ListServiceDependencies_RequestSyntax)**

`Name`, and `Environment` attributes.

This is a string-to-string map. It can
include the following fields.

- `Type` designates the type of object this is.

- `ResourceType` specifies the type of the resource. This field is used only
when the value of the `Type` field is `Resource` or `AWS::Resource`.

- `Name` specifies the name of the object. This is used only if the value of the `Type` field
is `Service`, `RemoteService`, or `AWS::Service`.

- `Identifier` identifies the resource objects of this resource.
This is used only if the value of the `Type` field
is `Resource` or `AWS::Resource`.

- `Environment` specifies the location where this object is hosted, or what it belongs to.

Type: String to string map

Map Entries: Maximum number of 4 items.

Key Pattern: `[a-zA-Z]{1,50}`

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[EndTime](#API_ListServiceDependencies_ResponseSyntax)**

The end of the time period that the returned information applies to. When used in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as
be epoch time in seconds. For example: `1698778057`

This displays the time that Application Signals used for the request. It might not match your request exactly, because
it was rounded to the nearest hour.

Type: Timestamp

**[NextToken](#API_ListServiceDependencies_ResponseSyntax)**

Include this value in your next use of this API to get next set
of service dependencies.

Type: String

**[ServiceDependencies](#API_ListServiceDependencies_ResponseSyntax)**

An array, where each object in the array contains information about one of the dependencies of this service.

Type: Array of [ServiceDependency](api-servicedependency.md) objects

Array Members: Minimum number of 0 items. Maximum number of 100 items.

**[StartTime](#API_ListServiceDependencies_ResponseSyntax)**

The start of the time period that the returned information applies to. When used in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as
be epoch time in seconds. For example: `1698778057`

This displays the time that Application Signals used for the request. It might not match your request exactly, because
it was rounded to the nearest hour.
