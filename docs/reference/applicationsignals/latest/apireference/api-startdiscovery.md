# StartDiscovery

Enables this AWS account to be able to use CloudWatch Application Signals
by creating the _AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchApplicationSignals_ service-linked role. This service-
linked role has the following permissions:

- `xray:GetServiceGraph`

- `logs:StartQuery`

- `logs:GetQueryResults`

- `cloudwatch:GetMetricData`

- `cloudwatch:ListMetrics`

- `tag:GetResources`

- `autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups`

A service-linked CloudTrail event channel is created to process CloudTrail events and return change event information. This includes last deployment time, userName, eventName, and other event metadata.

After completing this step, you still need to instrument your Java and Python applications to send data
to Application Signals. For more information, see
[Enabling Application Signals](../../../../services/amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-application-signals-enable.md).
