of service dependents.

Type: String

**[ServiceDependents](#API_ListServiceDependents_ResponseSyntax)**

An array, where each object in the array contains information about one of the dependents of this service.

Type: Array of [ServiceDependent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/applicationsignals/latest/APIReference/API_ServiceDependent.html) objects

Array Members: Minimum number of 0 items. Maximum number of 100 items.

**[StartTime](#API_ListServiceDependents_ResponseSyntax)**
