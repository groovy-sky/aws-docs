# UpdateStack

Updates a stack as specified in the template. After the call completes successfully, the
stack update starts. You can check the status of the stack through the [DescribeStacks](api-describestacks.md) action.

To get a copy of the template for an existing stack, you can use the [GetTemplate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_GetTemplate.html) action.

For more information about updating a stack and monitoring the progress of the update, see
[Managing\
AWS resources as a single unit with CloudFormation stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacks.html) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**Capabilities.member.N**

In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain
capabilities in order for CloudFormation to update the stack.

- `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`

Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your
AWS account, for example, by creating new IAM users. For those stacks, you must
explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities.

The following IAM resources require you to specify either the
`CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability.

- If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.

- If you have IAM resources with custom names, you _must_
specify `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`.

- If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an
`InsufficientCapabilities` error.

If your stack template contains these resources, we suggest that you review all
permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

- [AWS::IAM::AccessKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-accesskey.html)

- [AWS::IAM::Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-group.html)

- [AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-instanceprofile.html)

- [AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-managedpolicy.html)

- [AWS::IAM::Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-policy.html)

- [AWS::IAM::Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-role.html)

- [AWS::IAM::User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-user.html)

- [AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-usertogroupaddition.html)

For more information, see [Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/control-access-with-iam.md#using-iam-capabilities).

- `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`

Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can
include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive
transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set
from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros
before actually updating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros,
and you choose to update a stack directly from the processed template, without first
reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability.
This includes the [AWS::Include](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-include.html)
and [AWS::Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html) transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.

If you want to update a stack from a stack template that contains macros
_and_ nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from the
template using this capability.

###### Important

You should only update stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if
you know what processing the macro performs.

Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack
templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation
without CloudFormation being notified.

For more information, see [Perform custom processing\
on CloudFormation templates with template macros](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html).

###### Note

Only one of the `Capabilities` and `ResourceType` parameters can
be specified.

Type: Array of strings

Valid Values: `CAPABILITY_IAM | CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM | CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`

Required: No

**ClientRequestToken**

A unique identifier for this `UpdateStack` request. Specify this token if you
plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to update a stack
with the same name. You might retry `UpdateStack` requests to ensure that
CloudFormation successfully received them.

All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request
token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a
`CreateStack` operation with the token `token1`, then all the
`StackEvents` generated by that operation will have
`ClientRequestToken` set as `token1`.

In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack
operations that are initiated from the console use the token format
_Console-StackOperation-ID_, which helps you easily identify the stack
operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be
assigned the same token in the following format:
`Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9][-a-zA-Z0-9]*`

Required: No

**DisableRollback**

Preserve the state of previously provisioned resources when an operation fails.

Default: `False`

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**NotificationARNs.member.N**

Amazon Simple Notification Service topic Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) that CloudFormation
associates with the stack. Specify an empty list to remove all notification topics.

Type: Array of strings

Array Members: Maximum number of 5 items.

Required: No

**Parameters.member.N**

A list of `Parameter` structures that specify input parameters for the stack.
For more information, see the [Parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Parameter.html) data
type.

Type: Array of [Parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Parameter.html) objects

Required: No

**ResourceTypes.member.N**

Specifies which resource types you can work with, such as `AWS::EC2::Instance`
or `Custom::MyCustomInstance`.

If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're updating, the stack
update fails. By default, CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. IAM uses this
parameter for CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see
[Control CloudFormation\
access with AWS Identity and Access Management](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/control-access-with-iam.md).

###### Note

Only one of the `Capabilities` and `ResourceType` parameters can
be specified.

Type: Array of strings

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 256.

Required: No

**RetainExceptOnCreate**

When set to `true`, newly created resources are deleted when the operation
rolls back. This includes newly created resources marked with a deletion policy of
`Retain`.

Default: `false`

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**RoleARN**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that CloudFormation assumes to update the
stack. CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation always
uses this role for all future operations on the stack. Provided that users have permission to
operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to
pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.

If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with
the stack. If no role is available, CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from
your user credentials.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 20. Maximum length of 2048.

Required: No

**RollbackConfiguration**

The rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating
operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.

**StackPolicyBody**

Structure that contains a new stack policy body. You can specify either the
`StackPolicyBody` or the `StackPolicyURL` parameter, but not
both.

You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a new resource that
you created during a stack update. If you don't specify a stack policy, the current policy
that is associated with the stack is unchanged.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 16384.

Required: No

**StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody**

Structure that contains the temporary overriding stack policy body. You can specify either
the `StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody` or the `StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL`

If you want to update protected resources, specify a temporary overriding stack policy
during this update. If you don't specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated
with the stack will be used.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 16384.

Required: No

**StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL**

Location of a file that contains the temporary overriding stack policy. The URL must point
to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack. The
location for an Amazon S3 bucket must start with `https://`. URLs from S3 static
websites are not supported.

You can specify either the `StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody` or the
`StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL` parameter, but not both.

If you want to update protected resources, specify a temporary overriding stack policy
during this update. If you don't specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated
with the stack will be used.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 5120.

Required: No

**StackPolicyURL**

Location of a file that contains the updated stack policy. The URL must point to a policy
(max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack. The location for an
Amazon S3 bucket must start with `https://`. URLs from S3 static websites are not
supported.

You can specify either the `StackPolicyBody` or the `StackPolicyURL`
parameter, but not both.

You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a new resource that
you created during a stack update. If you don't specify a stack policy, the current policy
that is associated with the stack is unchanged.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 5120.

Required: No

**Tags.member.N**

Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. CloudFormation also propagates these tags to
supported resources in the stack. You can specify a maximum number of 50 tags.

If you don't specify this parameter, CloudFormation doesn't modify the stack's tags. If you
specify an empty value, CloudFormation removes all associated tags.

Type: Array of [Tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Tag.html) objects

`TemplateBody`, `TemplateURL`, or set the
`UsePreviousTemplate` to `true`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 5120.

Required: No

**UsePreviousTemplate**

Reuse the existing template that is associated with the stack that you are
updating.

When using templates with the `AWS::LanguageExtensions` transform, provide the
template instead of using `UsePreviousTemplate` to ensure new parameter values and
Systems Manager parameter updates are applied correctly. For more information, see [AWS::LanguageExtensions transform](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/templatereference/transform-aws-languageextensions.md).

Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters:
