# ListResourceScanResources

Lists the resources from a resource scan. The results can be filtered by resource
identifier, resource type prefix, tag key, and tag value. Only resources that match all
specified filters are returned. The response indicates whether each returned resource is
already managed by CloudFormation.

If the number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes a
`NextToken` value that you can use for the `NextToken` parameter to
get the next set of results. By default the `ListResourceScanResources` API action
will return at most 100 results in each response. The maximum value is 100.
