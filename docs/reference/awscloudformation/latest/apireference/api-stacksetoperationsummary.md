# StackSetOperationSummary

The structures that contain summary information about the specified operation.

## Contents

**Action**

The type of operation: `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.
Create and delete operations affect only the specified stack instances that are associated with
the specified StackSet. Update operations affect both the StackSet itself and
_all_ associated StackSet instances.

Type: String

Valid Values: `CREATE | UPDATE | DELETE | DETECT_DRIFT`

Required: No

**CreationTimestamp**

The time at which the operation was initiated. Note that the creation times for the StackSet
operation might differ from the creation time of the individual stacks themselves. This is
because CloudFormation needs to perform preparatory work for the operation, such as dispatching the
work to the requested Regions, before actually creating the first stacks.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**EndTimestamp**

The time at which the StackSet operation ended, across all accounts and Regions specified.
Note that this doesn't necessarily mean that the StackSet operation was successful, or even
attempted, in each account or Region.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**OperationId**

The unique ID of the StackSet operation.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9][-a-zA-Z0-9]*`

Required: No

**OperationPreferences**

The user-specified preferences for how CloudFormation performs a StackSet operation.

For more information about maximum concurrent accounts and failure tolerance, see [StackSet\
operation options](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/stacksets-concepts.md#stackset-ops-options).

Type: [StackSetOperationPreferences](api-stacksetoperationpreferences.md) object

Required: No

**Status**

The overall status of the operation.

- `FAILED`: The operation exceeded the specified failure tolerance. The failure
tolerance value that you've set for an operation is applied for each Region during stack create
and update operations. If the number of failed stacks within a Region exceeds the failure
tolerance, the status of the operation in the Region is set to `FAILED`. This in
turn sets the status of the operation as a whole to `FAILED`, and CloudFormation cancels
the operation in any remaining Regions.

- `QUEUED`: \[Service-managed permissions\] For automatic deployments that require
a sequence of operations, the operation is queued to be performed. For more information, see
the [StackSet status codes](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/stacksets-concepts.md#stackset-status-codes) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

- `RUNNING`: The operation is currently being performed.

- `STOPPED`: The user has canceled the operation.

- `STOPPING`: The operation is in the process of stopping, at user
request.

- `SUCCEEDED`: The operation completed creating or updating all the specified
stacks without exceeding the failure tolerance for the operation.

Type: String

Valid Values: `RUNNING | SUCCEEDED | FAILED | STOPPING | STOPPED | QUEUED`

Required: No

**StatusDetails**

Detailed information about the StackSet operation.

Type: [StackSetOperationStatusDetails](api-stacksetoperationstatusdetails.md) object

Required: No

**StatusReason**

The status of the operation in details.

Type: String

Required: No
