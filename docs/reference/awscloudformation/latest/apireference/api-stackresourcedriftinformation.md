# StackResourceDriftInformation

Contains information about whether the resource's actual configuration differs, or has
_drifted_, from its expected configuration.

## Contents

**StackResourceDriftStatus**

Status of the resource's actual configuration compared to its expected configuration

- `DELETED`: The resource differs from its expected configuration in that it has
been deleted.

- `MODIFIED`: The resource differs from its expected configuration.

- `NOT_CHECKED`: CloudFormation has not checked if the resource differs from its
expected configuration.

Any resources that do not currently support drift detection have a status of
`NOT_CHECKED`. For more information, see [Resource\
type support for imports and drift detection](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/resource-import-supported-resources.md).

- `IN_SYNC`: The resource's actual configuration matches its expected
configuration.

Type: String

Valid Values: `IN_SYNC | MODIFIED | DELETED | NOT_CHECKED | UNKNOWN | UNSUPPORTED`

Required: Yes

configuration.
