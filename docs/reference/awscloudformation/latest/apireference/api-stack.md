The time at which the stack was created.
Type: Timestamp
Required: Yes

 ** StackName **
The name associated with the stack.
Type: String
Required: Yes

 ** StackStatus **
Current status of the stack.
Type: String
Valid Values: `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS | CREATE_FAILED | CREATE_COMPLETE | ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS | ROLLBACK_FAILED | ROLLBACK_COMPLETE | DELETE_IN_PROGRESS | DELETE_FAILED | DELETE_COMPLETE | UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS | UPDATE_COMPLETE_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS | UPDATE_COMPLETE | UPDATE_FAILED | UPDATE_ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS | UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED | UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS | UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE | REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS | IMPORT_IN_PROGRESS | IMPORT_COMPLETE | IMPORT_ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS | IMPORT_ROLLBACK_FAILED | IMPORT_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`
Required: Yes

 ** Capabilities.member.N **
The capabilities allowed in the stack.
Type: Array of strings
Valid Values: `CAPABILITY_IAM | CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM | CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`
Required: No

 ** ChangeSetId **
The unique ID of the change set.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.
Pattern: `arn:[-a-zA-Z0-9:/]*`
Required: No

 ** DeletionMode **
Specifies the deletion mode for the stack. Possible values are:
+  `STANDARD` - Use the standard behavior. Specifying this value is the same as not specifying this parameter.
+  `FORCE_DELETE_STACK` - Delete the stack if it's stuck in a `DELETE_FAILED` state due to resource deletion failure.
Type: String
Valid Values: `STANDARD | FORCE_DELETE_STACK`
Required: No

 ** DeletionTime **
The time the stack was deleted.
Type: Timestamp
Required: No

 ** Description **
A user-defined description associated with the stack.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.
Required: No

 ** DetailedStatus **
The detailed status of the resource or stack. If `CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE` is present, the resource or resource configuration phase has completed and the stabilization of the resources is in progress. The StackSets `CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE` when all of the resources in the stack have reached that event. For more information, see [Understand CloudFormation stack creation events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stack-resource-configuration-complete.html) in the * AWS CloudFormation User Guide*.
Type: String
Valid Values: `CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE | VALIDATION_FAILED`
Required: No

 ** DisableRollback **
Boolean to enable or disable rollback on stack creation failures:
+  `true`: disable rollback.
+  `false`: enable rollback.
Type: Boolean
Required: No

 ** DriftInformation **
Information about whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has *drifted*, from its expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. For more information, see [Detect unmanaged configuration changes to stacks and resources with drift detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html).
Type: [StackDriftInformation](API_StackDriftInformation.md) object
Required: No

 ** EnableTerminationProtection **
Whether termination protection is enabled for the stack.
For [nested stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html), termination protection is set on the root stack and can't be changed directly on the nested stack. For more information, see [Protect a CloudFormation stack from being deleted](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-protect-stacks.html) in the * AWS CloudFormation User Guide*.
Type: Boolean
Required: No

 ** LastOperations.member.N **
Information about the most recent operations performed on this stack.
Type: Array of [OperationEntry](API_OperationEntry.md) objects
Required: No

 ** LastUpdatedTime **
The time the stack was last updated. This field will only be returned if the stack has been updated at least once.
Type: Timestamp
Required: No

 ** NotificationARNs.member.N **
Amazon SNS topic Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to which stack related events are published.
Type: Array of strings
Array Members: Maximum number of 5 items.
Required: No

 ** Outputs.member.N **
A list of output structures.
Type: Array of [Output](API_Output.md) objects
Required: No

 ** Parameters.member.N **
A list of `Parameter` structures.
Type: Array of [Parameter](API_Parameter.md) objects
Required: No

 ** ParentId **
For nested stacks, the stack ID of the direct parent of this stack. For the first level of nested stacks, the root stack is also the parent stack.
For more information, see [Nested stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html) in the * AWS CloudFormation User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** RetainExceptOnCreate **
When set to `true`, newly created resources are deleted when the operation rolls back. This includes newly created resources marked with a deletion policy of `Retain`.
Default: `false`
Type: Boolean
Required: No

 ** RoleARN **
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that's associated with the stack. During a stack operation, CloudFormation uses this role's credentials to make calls on your behalf.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 20. Maximum length of 2048.
Required: No

 ** RollbackConfiguration **
The rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.
Type: [RollbackConfiguration](API_RollbackConfiguration.md) object
Required: No

 ** RootId **
For nested stacks, the stack ID of the top-level stack to which the nested stack ultimately belongs.
For more information, see [Nested stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html) in the * AWS CloudFormation User Guide*.

Array Members: Maximum number of 50 items.
Required: No

 ** TimeoutInMinutes **
The amount of time within which stack creation should complete.
Type: Integer
Valid Range: Minimum value of 1.
Required: No
