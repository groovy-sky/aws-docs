Valid Values: `CAPABILITY_IAM | CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM | CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`

Required: No

**ChangeSetId**

The unique ID of the change set.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.

Pattern: `arn:[-a-zA-Z0-9:/]*`

Required: No

**DeletionMode**

Specifies the deletion mode for the stack. Possible values are:

- `STANDARD` \- Use the standard behavior. Specifying this value is the same as
not specifying this parameter.

- `FORCE_DELETE_STACK` \- Delete the stack if it's stuck in a
`DELETE_FAILED` state due to resource deletion failure.

Type: String

Valid Values: `STANDARD | FORCE_DELETE_STACK`

Required: No

**DeletionTime**

The time the stack was deleted.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**Description**

A user-defined description associated with the stack.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

Required: No

**DetailedStatus**

The detailed status of the resource or stack. If `CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE` is
present, the resource or resource configuration phase has completed and the stabilization of the
resources is in progress. The StackSets `CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE` when all of the
resources in the stack have reached that event. For more information, see [Understand\
CloudFormation stack creation events](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/stack-resource-configuration-complete.md) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

Type: String

Valid Values: `CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE | VALIDATION_FAILED`

Required: No

**DisableRollback**

Boolean to enable or disable rollback on stack creation failures:

- `true`: disable rollback.

- `false`: enable rollback.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**DriftInformation**

Information about whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has
_drifted_, from its expected configuration, as defined in the stack template
and any values specified as template parameters. For more information, see [Detect\
unmanaged configuration changes to stacks and resources with drift detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html).

Type: [StackDriftInformation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_StackDriftInformation.html) object

Required: No

**EnableTerminationProtection**

Whether termination protection is enabled for the stack.

For [nested stacks](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.md),
termination protection is set on the root stack and can't be changed directly on the nested
stack. For more information, see [Protect a CloudFormation\
stack from being deleted](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/using-cfn-protect-stacks.md) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**LastOperations.member.N**

Information about the most recent operations performed on this stack.

Type: Array of [OperationEntry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_OperationEntry.html) objects

Required: No

**LastUpdatedTime**

The time the stack was last updated. This field will only be returned if the stack has been
updated at least once.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**NotificationARNs.member.N**

Amazon SNS topic Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to which stack related events are published.

Type: Array of strings

Array Members: Maximum number of 5 items.

Required: No

**Outputs.member.N**

A list of output structures.

Type: Array of [Output](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Output.html) objects

Required: No

**Parameters.member.N**

A list of `Parameter` structures.

Type: Array of [Parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Parameter.html) objects

Required: No

**ParentId**

For nested stacks, the stack ID of the direct parent of this stack. For the first level of
nested stacks, the root stack is also the parent stack.

For more information, see [Nested stacks](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.md) in
the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**RetainExceptOnCreate**

When set to `true`, newly created resources are deleted when the operation rolls
back. This includes newly created resources marked with a deletion policy of
`Retain`.

Default: `false`

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**RoleARN**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that's associated with the stack. During a
stack operation, CloudFormation uses this role's credentials to make calls on your behalf.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 20. Maximum length of 2048.

Required: No

**RollbackConfiguration**

The rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating
operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.

Type: [RollbackConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RollbackConfiguration.html) object

Required: No

**RootId**

For nested stacks, the stack ID of the top-level stack to which the nested stack ultimately
