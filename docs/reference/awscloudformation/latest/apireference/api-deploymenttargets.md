# DeploymentTargets

Specifies the AWS Organizations accounts where you want to create, update, or delete
stack instances. You can target either your entire organization or specific accounts using
organizational units (OUs) and account filter options.

CloudFormation doesn't deploy stack instances to the organization management account, even if the organization management account is in your organization or in an OU
in your organization.

When performing create operations, if you specify both `OrganizationalUnitIds`
and `Accounts`, you must also specify the `AccountFilterType` property.

## Contents

**AccountFilterType**

Refines which accounts will have stack operations performed on them by specifying how to use
the `Accounts` and `OrganizationalUnitIds` properties together.

The following values determine how CloudFormation selects target accounts:

- `INTERSECTION`: Performs stack operations only on specific individual accounts
within the selected OUs. Only accounts that are both specified in the `Accounts`
property and belong to the specified OUs will be targeted.

- `DIFFERENCE`: Performs stack operations on all accounts in the selected OUs
except for specific accounts listed in the `Accounts` property. This enables you to
exclude certain accounts within an OU, such as suspended accounts.

- `UNION`: Performs stack operations on the specified OUs plus additional
individual accounts listed in the `Accounts` property. This is the default value if
`AccountFilterType` is not provided. This lets you target an entire OU and
individual accounts from a different OU in one request. Note that `UNION` is not
supported for `CreateStackInstances` operations.

- `NONE`: Performs stack operations on all accounts in the specified
organizational units (OUs).

Type: String

Valid Values: `NONE | INTERSECTION | DIFFERENCE | UNION`

Required: No

**Accounts.member.N**

The AWS account IDs where you want to perform stack operations. How these accounts are
used depends on the `AccountFilterType` property.

If you have many account numbers, you can provide those accounts using the
`AccountsUrl` property instead.

Type: Array of strings

Pattern: `^[0-9]{12}$`

Required: No

**AccountsUrl**

The Amazon S3 URL path to a file that contains a list of AWS account IDs. The file
format must be either `.csv` or `.txt`, and the data can be comma-separated
or new-line-separated. There is currently a 10MB limit for the data (approximately 800,000
accounts).

This property serves the same purpose as `Accounts` but allows you to specify a
large number of accounts.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 5120.

Pattern: `(s3://|http(s?)://).+`

Required: No

**OrganizationalUnitIds.member.N**

The organization root ID or organizational unit (OU) IDs where you want to perform stack
operations. CloudFormation will perform operations on accounts within these OUs and their child
OUs.

Type: Array of strings

Pattern: `^(ou-[a-z0-9]{4,32}-[a-z0-9]{8,32}|r-[a-z0-9]{4,32})$`

Required: No
