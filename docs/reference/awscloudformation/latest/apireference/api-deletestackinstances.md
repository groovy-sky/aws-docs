# DeleteStackInstances

Deletes stack instances for the specified accounts, in the specified AWS Regions.

###### Note

The maximum number of organizational unit (OUs) supported by a
`DeleteStackInstances` operation is 50.

If you need more than 50, consider the following options:

- _Batch processing:_ If you don't want to expose your OU
hierarchy, split up the operations into multiple calls with less than 50 OUs
each.

- _Parent OU strategy:_ If you don't mind exposing the OU
hierarchy, target a parent OU that contains all desired child OUs.

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**Accounts.member.N**

\[Self-managed permissions\] The account IDs of the AWS accounts that you want to delete
stack instances for.

You can specify `Accounts` or `DeploymentTargets`, but not
both.

Type: Array of strings

Pattern: `^[0-9]{12}$`

Required: No

**CallAs**

\[Service-managed permissions\] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator
in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a
member account.

By default, `SELF` is specified. Use `SELF` for StackSets with
self-managed permissions.

- If you are signed in to the management account, specify
`SELF`.

- If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
`DELEGATED_ADMIN`.

Your AWS account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more information, see [Register a\
delegated administrator](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/stacksets-orgs-delegated-admin.md) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

Type: String

Valid Values: `SELF | DELEGATED_ADMIN`

Required: No

**DeploymentTargets**

\[Service-managed permissions\] The AWS Organizations accounts from which to delete
stack instances.

You can specify `Accounts` or `DeploymentTargets`, but not
both.

Type: [DeploymentTargets](api-deploymenttargets.md) object

Required: No

**OperationId**

The unique identifier for this StackSet operation.

The operation ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that CloudFormation
performs the StackSet operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You
can retry StackSet operation requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received
them.

Repeating this StackSet operation with a new operation ID retries all stack instances
whose status is `OUTDATED`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9][-a-zA-Z0-9]*`

Required: No

**OperationPreferences**

Preferences for how CloudFormation performs this StackSet operation.

Type: [StackSetOperationPreferences](api-stacksetoperationpreferences.md) object

Required: No

**Regions.member.N**

The AWS Regions where you want to delete StackSet instances.

Type: Array of strings

Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,128}$`

Required: Yes

**RetainStacks**

Removes the stack instances from the specified StackSet, but doesn't delete the stacks.
You can't reassociate a retained stack or add an existing, saved stack to a new stack
set.

For more information, see [StackSet operation options](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/stacksets-concepts.md#stackset-ops-options).

Type: Boolean

Required: Yes

**StackSetName**

The name or unique ID of the StackSet that you want to delete stack instances for.

Type: String

Required: Yes

## Response Elements

The following element is returned by the service.

**OperationId**

The unique identifier for this StackSet operation.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9][-a-zA-Z0-9]*`

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**InvalidOperation**

The specified operation isn't valid.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**OperationIdAlreadyExists**

The specified operation ID already exists.

HTTP Status Code: 409

**OperationInProgress**

Another operation is currently in progress for this StackSet. Only one operation can be performed for a stack
set at a given time.

HTTP Status Code: 409

**StackSetNotFound**

The specified StackSet doesn't exist.

HTTP Status Code: 404

**StaleRequest**

Another operation has been performed on this StackSet since the specified operation was performed.

HTTP Status Code: 409
