# DeleteStackInstances
<a name="API_DeleteStackInstances"></a>

Deletes stack instances for the specified accounts, in the specified AWS Regions.

**Note**
The maximum number of organizational unit (OUs) supported by a `DeleteStackInstances` operation is 50.
If you need more than 50, consider the following options:
 *Batch processing:* If you don't want to expose your OU hierarchy, split up the operations into multiple calls with less than 50 OUs each.
 *Parent OU strategy:* If you don't mind exposing the OU hierarchy, target a parent OU that contains all desired child OUs.

## Request Parameters
<a name="API_DeleteStackInstances_RequestParameters"></a>

 For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](CommonParameters.md).

 **Accounts.member.N**
[Self-managed permissions] The account IDs of the AWS accounts that you want to delete stack instances for.
You can specify `Accounts` or `DeploymentTargets`, but not both.
Type: Array of strings
Pattern: `^[0-9]{12}$`
Required: No

 ** CallAs **
[Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a member account.
By default, `SELF` is specified. Use `SELF` for StackSets with self-managed permissions.
+ If you are signed in to the management account, specify `SELF`.
+ If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify `DELEGATED_ADMIN`.

  Your AWS account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more information, see [Register a delegated administrator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-delegated-admin.html) in the * AWS CloudFormation User Guide*.
Type: String
Valid Values: `SELF | DELEGATED_ADMIN`
Required: No

 ** DeploymentTargets **
[Service-managed permissions] The AWS Organizations accounts from which to delete stack instances.
You can specify `Accounts` or `DeploymentTargets`, but not both.
Type: [DeploymentTargets](API_DeploymentTargets.md) object
Required: No

 ** OperationId **
The unique identifier for this StackSet operation.
The operation ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that CloudFormation performs the StackSet operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You can retry StackSet operation requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.
Repeating this StackSet operation with a new operation ID retries all stack instances whose status is `OUTDATED`.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.
Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9][-a-zA-Z0-9]*`
Required: No

 ** OperationPreferences **
Preferences for how CloudFormation performs this StackSet operation.
Type: [StackSetOperationPreferences](API_StackSetOperationPreferences.md) object
Required: No

 **Regions.member.N**
The AWS Regions where you want to delete StackSet instances.
Type: Array of strings
Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,128}$`
Required: Yes

 ** RetainStacks **
Removes the stack instances from the specified StackSet, but doesn't delete the stacks. You can't reassociate a retained stack or add an existing, saved stack to a new stack set.
For more information, see [StackSet operation options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html#stackset-ops-options).
Type: Boolean
Required: Yes

 ** StackSetName **
The name or unique ID of the StackSet that you want to delete stack instances for.
Type: String
Required: Yes
