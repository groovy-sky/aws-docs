# DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus

Returns information about a stack drift detection operation. A stack drift detection
operation detects whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has
_drifted_, from its expected configuration, as defined in the stack
template and any values specified as template parameters. A stack is considered to have
drifted if one or more of its resources have drifted. For more information about stack and
resource drift, see [Detect unmanaged\
configuration changes to stacks and resources with drift detection](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/using-cfn-stack-drift.md).

Use [DetectStackDrift](api-detectstackdrift.md) to initiate a stack drift detection operation.
`DetectStackDrift` returns a `StackDriftDetectionId` you can use to
monitor the progress of the operation using `DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus`.
Once the drift detection operation has completed, use [DescribeStackResourceDrifts](api-describestackresourcedrifts.md) to return drift information about the stack and its
resources.

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**StackDriftDetectionId**

The ID of the drift detection results of this operation.

CloudFormation generates new results, with a new drift detection ID, each time this operation
is run. However, the number of drift results CloudFormation retains for any given stack, and for
how long, may vary.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 36.

Required: Yes

## Response Elements

The following elements are returned by the service.

**DetectionStatus**

The status of the stack drift detection operation.

- `DETECTION_COMPLETE`: The stack drift detection operation has successfully
completed for all resources in the stack that support drift detection. (Resources that
don't currently support stack detection remain unchecked.)

If you specified logical resource IDs for CloudFormation to use as a filter for the stack
drift detection operation, only the resources with those logical IDs are checked for
drift.

- `DETECTION_FAILED`: The stack drift detection operation has failed for at
least one resource in the stack. Results will be available for resources on which
CloudFormation successfully completed drift detection.

- `DETECTION_IN_PROGRESS`: The stack drift detection operation is currently
in progress.

Type: String

Valid Values: `DETECTION_IN_PROGRESS | DETECTION_FAILED | DETECTION_COMPLETE`

**DetectionStatusReason**

The reason the stack drift detection operation has its current status.

Type: String

**DriftedStackResourceCount**

Total number of stack resources that have drifted. This is NULL until the drift detection
operation reaches a status of `DETECTION_COMPLETE`. This value will be 0 for stacks
whose drift status is `IN_SYNC`.

Type: Integer

**StackDriftDetectionId**

The ID of the drift detection results of this operation.

CloudFormation generates new results, with a new drift detection ID, each time this operation
is run. However, the number of reports CloudFormation retains for any given stack, and for how
long, may vary.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 36.

**StackDriftStatus**

Status of the stack's actual configuration compared to its expected configuration.

- `DRIFTED`: The stack differs from its expected template configuration. A
stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources have drifted.

- `NOT_CHECKED`: CloudFormation hasn't checked if the stack differs from its
expected template configuration.

- `IN_SYNC`: The stack's actual configuration matches its expected template
configuration.

- `UNKNOWN`: CloudFormation could not run drift detection for a resource in the
stack. See the `DetectionStatusReason` for details.

Type: String

Valid Values: `DRIFTED | IN_SYNC | UNKNOWN | NOT_CHECKED`

**StackId**

The ID of the stack.

Type: String

**Timestamp**

Time at which the stack drift detection operation was initiated.

Type: Timestamp
