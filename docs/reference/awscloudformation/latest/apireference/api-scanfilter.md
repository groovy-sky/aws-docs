 ** Types.member.N **
An array of strings where each string represents an AWS resource type you want to scan. Each string defines the resource type using the format `AWS::ServiceName::ResourceType`, for example, `AWS::DynamoDB::Table`. For the full list of supported resource types, see the [Resource type support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-import-supported-resources.html) table in the * AWS CloudFormation User Guide*.
To scan all resource types within a service, you can use a wildcard, represented by an asterisk (`*`). You can place an asterisk at only the end of the string, for example, `AWS::S3::*`.
