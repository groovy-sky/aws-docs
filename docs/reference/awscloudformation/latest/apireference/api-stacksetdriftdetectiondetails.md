# StackSetDriftDetectionDetails

Detailed information about the drift status of the StackSet.

For StackSets, contains information about the last _completed_ drift
operation performed on the StackSet. Information about drift operations in-progress isn't
included.

For StackSet operations, includes information about drift operations currently being
performed on the StackSet.

For more information, see [Performing drift detection on\
CloudFormation StackSets](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/stacksets-drift.md) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

## Contents

**DriftDetectionStatus**

The status of the StackSet drift detection operation.

- `COMPLETED`: The drift detection operation completed without failing on any
stack instances.

- `FAILED`: The drift detection operation exceeded the specified failure
tolerance.

- `PARTIAL_SUCCESS`: The drift detection operation completed without exceeding
the failure tolerance for the operation.

- `IN_PROGRESS`: The drift detection operation is currently being
performed.

- `STOPPED`: The user has canceled the drift detection operation.

Type: String

Valid Values: `COMPLETED | FAILED | PARTIAL_SUCCESS | IN_PROGRESS | STOPPED`

Required: No

**DriftedStackInstancesCount**

The number of stack instances that have drifted from the expected template and parameter
configuration of the StackSet. A stack instance is considered to have drifted if one or more of
the resources in the associated stack don't match their expected configuration.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.

Required: No

**DriftStatus**

Status of the StackSet's actual configuration compared to its expected template and
parameter configuration.

- `DRIFTED`: One or more of the stack instances belonging to the StackSet differs
from the expected template and parameter configuration. A stack instance is considered to have
drifted if one or more of the resources in the associated stack have drifted.

- `NOT_CHECKED`: CloudFormation hasn't checked the StackSet for drift.

- `IN_SYNC`: All of the stack instances belonging to the StackSet stack match the
expected template and parameter configuration.

Type: String

Valid Values: `DRIFTED | IN_SYNC | NOT_CHECKED`

Required: No

**FailedStackInstancesCount**

The number of stack instances for which the drift detection operation failed.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.

Required: No

**InProgressStackInstancesCount**

The number of stack instances that are currently being checked for drift.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.

Required: No

**InSyncStackInstancesCount**

The number of stack instances which match the expected template and parameter configuration
of the StackSet.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.

Required: No

**LastDriftCheckTimestamp**

Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detection operation on the StackSet. This
value will be `NULL` for any StackSet that drift detection hasn't yet been performed
on.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**TotalStackInstancesCount**

The total number of stack instances belonging to this StackSet.

The total number of stack instances is equal to the total of:

- Stack instances that match the StackSet configuration.

- Stack instances that have drifted from the StackSet configuration.

- Stack instances where the drift detection operation has failed.

- Stack instances currently being checked for drift.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.

Required: No
