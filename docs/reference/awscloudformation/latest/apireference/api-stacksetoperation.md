# StackSetOperation

The structure that contains information about a StackSet operation.

## Contents

**Action**

The type of StackSet operation: `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, or
`DELETE`. Create and delete operations affect only the specified stack instances that
are associated with the specified StackSet. Update operations affect both the StackSet itself, in
addition to _all_ associated stack instances.

Type: String

Valid Values: `CREATE | UPDATE | DELETE | DETECT_DRIFT`

Required: No

**AdministrationRoleARN**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role used to perform this StackSet
operation.

Use customized administrator roles to control which users or groups can manage specific
StackSets within the same administrator account. For more information, see [Grant self-managed\
permissions](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/stacksets-prereqs-self-managed.md) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 20. Maximum length of 2048.

Required: No

**CreationTimestamp**

The time at which the operation was initiated. Note that the creation times for the stack
set operation might differ from the creation time of the individual stacks themselves. This is
because CloudFormation needs to perform preparatory work for the operation, such as dispatching the
work to the requested Regions, before actually creating the first stacks.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**DeploymentTargets**

The AWS Organizations accounts affected by the stack operation. Valid only if the
StackSet uses service-managed permissions.

Type: [DeploymentTargets](api-deploymenttargets.md) object

Required: No

**EndTimestamp**

The time at which the StackSet operation ended, across all accounts and Regions specified.
Note that this doesn't necessarily mean that the StackSet operation was successful, or even
attempted, in each account or Region.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**ExecutionRoleName**

The name of the IAM execution role used to create or update the StackSet.

Use customized execution roles to control which stack resources users and groups can include
in their StackSets.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.

Pattern: `[a-zA-Z_0-9+=,.@-]+`

Required: No

**OperationId**

The unique ID of a StackSet operation.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9][-a-zA-Z0-9]*`

Required: No

**OperationPreferences**

The preferences for how CloudFormation performs this StackSet operation.

Type: [StackSetOperationPreferences](api-stacksetoperationpreferences.md) object

Required: No

**RetainStacks**

For StackSet operations of action type `DELETE`, specifies whether to remove the
stack instances from the specified StackSet, but doesn't delete the stacks. You can't
re-associate a retained stack, or add an existing, saved stack to a new StackSet.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**StackSetDriftDetectionDetails**

Detailed information about the drift status of the StackSet. This includes information about
drift operations currently being performed on the StackSet.

This information will only be present for StackSet operations whose `Action` type
is `DETECT_DRIFT`.

For more information, see [Performing drift detection on\
CloudFormation StackSets](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/stacksets-drift.md) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

Type: [StackSetDriftDetectionDetails](api-stacksetdriftdetectiondetails.md) object

Required: No

**StackSetId**

The ID of the StackSet.

Type: String

Required: No

**Status**

The status of the operation.

- `FAILED`: The operation exceeded the specified failure tolerance. The failure
tolerance value that you've set for an operation is applied for each Region during stack create
and update operations. If the number of failed stacks within a Region exceeds the failure
tolerance, the status of the operation in the Region is set to `FAILED`. This in
turn sets the status of the operation as a whole to `FAILED`, and CloudFormation cancels
the operation in any remaining Regions.

- `QUEUED`: \[Service-managed permissions\] For automatic deployments that require
a sequence of operations, the operation is queued to be performed. For more information, see
the [StackSets status codes](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/stacksets-concepts.md#stackset-status-codes) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

- `RUNNING`: The operation is currently being performed.

- `STOPPED`: The user has canceled the operation.

- `STOPPING`: The operation is in the process of stopping, at user
request.

- `SUCCEEDED`: The operation completed creating or updating all the specified
stacks without exceeding the failure tolerance for the operation.

Type: String

Valid Values: `RUNNING | SUCCEEDED | FAILED | STOPPING | STOPPED | QUEUED`

Required: No

**StatusDetails**

Detailed information about the StackSet operation.

Type: [StackSetOperationStatusDetails](api-stacksetoperationstatusdetails.md) object

Required: No

**StatusReason**

The status of the operation in details.

Type: String

Required: No
