# ResourceChange

The `ResourceChange` structure describes the resource and the action that
CloudFormation will perform on it if you execute this change set.

## Contents

**Action**

The action that CloudFormation takes on the resource, such as `Add` (adds a new
resource), `Modify` (changes a resource), `Remove` (deletes a resource),
`Import` (imports a resource), `Dynamic` (exact action for the resource
can't be determined), or `SyncWithActual` (resource will not be changed, only
CloudFormation metadata will change).

Type: String

Valid Values: `Add | Modify | Remove | Import | Dynamic | SyncWithActual`

Required: No

**AfterContext**

An encoded JSON string that contains the context of the resource after the change is
executed.

Type: String

Required: No

**BeforeContext**

An encoded JSON string that contains the context of the resource before the change is
executed.

Type: String

Required: No

**ChangeSetId**

The change set ID of the nested change set.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.

Pattern: `arn:[-a-zA-Z0-9:/]*`

Required: No

**Details.member.N**

For the `Modify` action, a list of `ResourceChangeDetail` structures
that describes the changes that CloudFormation will make to the resource.

Type: Array of [ResourceChangeDetail](api-resourcechangedetail.md) objects

Required: No

**LogicalResourceId**

The resource's logical ID, which is defined in the stack's template.

Type: String

Required: No

**ModuleInfo**

Contains information about the module from which the resource was created, if the resource
was created from a module included in the stack template.

Type: [ModuleInfo](api-moduleinfo.md) object

Required: No

**PhysicalResourceId**

The resource's physical ID (resource name). Resources that you are adding don't have
physical IDs because they haven't been created.

Type: String

Required: No

**PolicyAction**

The action that will be taken on the physical resource when the change set is
executed.

- `Delete` The resource will be deleted.

- `Retain` The resource will be retained.

- `Snapshot` The resource will have a snapshot taken.

- `ReplaceAndDelete` The resource will be replaced and then deleted.

- `ReplaceAndRetain` The resource will be replaced and then retained.

- `ReplaceAndSnapshot` The resource will be replaced and then have a snapshot
taken.

Type: String

Valid Values: `Delete | Retain | Snapshot | ReplaceAndDelete | ReplaceAndRetain | ReplaceAndSnapshot`

Required: No

**PreviousDeploymentContext**

Information about the resource's state from the previous CloudFormation deployment.

Type: String

Required: No

**Replacement**

For the `Modify` action, indicates whether CloudFormation will replace the resource
by creating a new one and deleting the old one. This value depends on the value of the
`RequiresRecreation` property in the `ResourceTargetDefinition` structure.
For example, if the `RequiresRecreation` field is `Always` and the
`Evaluation` field is `Static`, `Replacement` is
`True`. If the `RequiresRecreation` field is `Always` and the
`Evaluation` field is `Dynamic`, `Replacement` is
`Conditional`.

If you have multiple changes with different `RequiresRecreation` values, the
`Replacement` value depends on the change with the most impact. A
`RequiresRecreation` value of `Always` has the most impact, followed by
`Conditional`, and then `Never`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `True | False | Conditional`

Required: No

**ResourceDriftIgnoredAttributes.member.N**

List of resource attributes for which drift was ignored.

Type: Array of [ResourceDriftIgnoredAttribute](api-resourcedriftignoredattribute.md) objects

Required: No

**ResourceDriftStatus**

The drift status of the resource. Valid values:

- `IN_SYNC` – The resource matches its template definition.

- `MODIFIED` – Resource properties were modified outside CloudFormation.

- `DELETED` – The resource was deleted outside CloudFormation.

- `NOT_CHECKED` – CloudFormation doesn’t currently return this value.

- `UNKNOWN` – Drift status could not be determined.

- `UNSUPPORTED` – Resource type does not support actual state comparison.

Only present for drift-aware change sets.

Type: String

Valid Values: `IN_SYNC | MODIFIED | DELETED | NOT_CHECKED | UNKNOWN | UNSUPPORTED`

Required: No

**ResourceType**

The type of CloudFormation resource, such as `AWS::S3::Bucket`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 256.

Required: No

**Scope.member.N**

For the `Modify` action, indicates which resource attribute is triggering this
update, such as a change in the resource attribute's `Metadata`,
`Properties`, or `Tags`.

Type: Array of strings

Valid Values: `Properties | Metadata | CreationPolicy | UpdatePolicy | DeletionPolicy | UpdateReplacePolicy | Tags`

Required: No
