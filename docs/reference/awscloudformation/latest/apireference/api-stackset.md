# StackSet
<a name="API_StackSet"></a>

A structure that contains information about a StackSet. With StackSets, you can provision stacks across AWS accounts and Regions from a single CloudFormation template. Each stack is based on the same CloudFormation template, but you can customize individual stacks using parameters.

## Contents
<a name="API_StackSet_Contents"></a>

 ** AdministrationRoleARN **
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role used to create or update the stack set.
Use customized administrator roles to control which users or groups can manage specific StackSets within the same administrator account. For more information, see [Prerequisites for using CloudFormation StackSets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs.html) in the * AWS CloudFormation User Guide*.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 20. Maximum length of 2048.
Required: No

 ** AutoDeployment **
Describes whether StackSets automatically deploys to AWS Organizations accounts that are added to a target organization or organizational unit (OU). Valid only if the StackSet uses service-managed permissions.
Type: [AutoDeployment](API_AutoDeployment.md) object
Required: No

 ** Capabilities.member.N **
The capabilities that are allowed in the StackSet. Some StackSet templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account—for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For more information, see [Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/control-access-with-iam.html#using-iam-capabilities).
Type: Array of strings
Valid Values: `CAPABILITY_IAM | CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM | CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`
Required: No

 ** Description **
A description of the StackSet that you specify when the StackSet is created or updated.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.
Required: No

 ** ExecutionRoleName **
The name of the IAM execution role used to create or update the StackSet.
Use customized execution roles to control which stack resources users and groups can include in their StackSets.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.
Pattern: `[a-zA-Z_0-9+=,.@-]+`
Required: No

 ** ManagedExecution **
Describes whether StackSets performs non-conflicting operations concurrently and queues conflicting operations.
Type: [ManagedExecution](API_ManagedExecution.md) object
Required: No

 ** OrganizationalUnitIds.member.N **
[Service-managed permissions] The organization root ID or organizational unit (OU) IDs that you specified for [DeploymentTargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DeploymentTargets.html).
Type: Array of strings
Pattern: `^(ou-[a-z0-9]{4,32}-[a-z0-9]{8,32}|r-[a-z0-9]{4,32})$`
Required: No

 ** Parameters.member.N **
A list of input parameters for a StackSet.
Type: Array of [Parameter](API_Parameter.md) objects
Required: No

 ** PermissionModel **
Describes how the IAM roles required for StackSet operations are created.
+ With `self-managed` permissions, you must create the administrator and execution roles required to deploy to target accounts. For more information, see [Grant self-managed permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs-self-managed.html).
+ With `service-managed` permissions, StackSets automatically creates the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by AWS Organizations. For more information, see [Activate trusted access for StackSets with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-activate-trusted-access.html).
Type: String
Valid Values: `SERVICE_MANAGED | SELF_MANAGED`
Required: No

 ** Regions.member.N **
Returns a list of all AWS Regions the given StackSet has stack instances deployed in. The AWS Regions list output is in no particular order.
Type: Array of strings
Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,128}$`
Required: No

 ** StackSetARN **
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the StackSet.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** StackSetDriftDetectionDetails **
Detailed information about the drift status of the StackSet.
For StackSets, contains information about the last *completed* drift operation performed on the StackSet. Information about drift operations currently in progress isn't included.
Type: [StackSetDriftDetectionDetails](API_StackSetDriftDetectionDetails.md) object
Required: No

 ** StackSetId **
The ID of the StackSet.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** StackSetName **
The name that's associated with the StackSet.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** Status **
The status of the StackSet.
Type: String
Valid Values: `ACTIVE | DELETED`
Required: No

 ** Tags.member.N **
A list of tags that specify information about the StackSet. A maximum number of 50 tags can be specified.
Type: Array of [Tag](API_Tag.md) objects
Array Members: Maximum number of 50 items.
Required: No

 ** TemplateBody **
The structure that contains the body of the template that was used to create or update the StackSet.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.
Required: No
