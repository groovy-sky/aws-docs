# StackInstanceResourceDriftsSummary
<a name="API_StackInstanceResourceDriftsSummary"></a>

The structure containing summary information about resource drifts for a stack instance.

## Contents
<a name="API_StackInstanceResourceDriftsSummary_Contents"></a>

 ** LogicalResourceId **
The logical name of the resource specified in the template.
Type: String
Required: Yes

 ** ResourceType **
Type of resource. For more information, see [AWS resource and property types reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) in the * AWS CloudFormation User Guide*.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 256.
Required: Yes

 ** StackId **
The ID of the stack instance.
Type: String
Required: Yes

 ** StackResourceDriftStatus **
The drift status of the resource in a stack instance.
+  `DELETED`: The resource differs from its expected template configuration in that the resource has been deleted.
+  `MODIFIED`: One or more resource properties differ from their expected template values.
+  `IN_SYNC`: The resource's actual configuration matches its expected template configuration.
+  `NOT_CHECKED`: CloudFormation doesn't currently return this value.
Type: String
Valid Values: `IN_SYNC | MODIFIED | DELETED | NOT_CHECKED | UNKNOWN | UNSUPPORTED`
Required: Yes

 ** Timestamp **
Time at which the stack instance drift detection operation was initiated.
Type: Timestamp
Required: Yes

 ** PhysicalResourceId **
The name or unique identifier that corresponds to a physical instance ID of a resource supported by CloudFormation.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** PhysicalResourceIdContext.member.N **
Context information that enables CloudFormation to uniquely identify a resource. CloudFormation uses context key-value pairs in cases where a resource's logical and physical IDs aren't enough to uniquely identify that resource. Each context key-value pair specifies a unique resource that contains the targeted resource.
Type: Array of [PhysicalResourceIdContextKeyValuePair](API_PhysicalResourceIdContextKeyValuePair.md) objects
Array Members: Maximum number of 5 items.
Required: No

 ** PropertyDifferences.member.N **
Status of the actual configuration of the resource compared to its expected configuration. These will be present only for resources whose `StackInstanceResourceDriftStatus` is `MODIFIED`.
Type: Array of [PropertyDifference](API_PropertyDifference.md) objects
Required: No
