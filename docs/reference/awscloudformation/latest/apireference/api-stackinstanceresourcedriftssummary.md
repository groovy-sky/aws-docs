# StackInstanceResourceDriftsSummary

The structure containing summary information about resource drifts for a stack
instance.

## Contents

**LogicalResourceId**

The logical name of the resource specified in the template.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**ResourceType**

Type of resource. For more information, see [AWS resource and\
property types reference](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.md) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 256.

Required: Yes

**StackId**

The ID of the stack instance.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**StackResourceDriftStatus**

The drift status of the resource in a stack instance.

- `DELETED`: The resource differs from its expected template configuration in
that the resource has been deleted.

- `MODIFIED`: One or more resource properties differ from their expected template
values.

- `IN_SYNC`: The resource's actual configuration matches its expected template
configuration.

- `NOT_CHECKED`: CloudFormation doesn't currently return this value.

Type: String

Valid Values: `IN_SYNC | MODIFIED | DELETED | NOT_CHECKED | UNKNOWN | UNSUPPORTED`

Required: Yes

**Timestamp**

Time at which the stack instance drift detection operation was initiated.

Type: Timestamp

Required: Yes

**PhysicalResourceId**

The name or unique identifier that corresponds to a physical instance ID of a resource
supported by CloudFormation.

Type: String

Required: No

**PhysicalResourceIdContext.member.N**

Context information that enables CloudFormation to uniquely identify a resource. CloudFormation uses
context key-value pairs in cases where a resource's logical and physical IDs aren't enough to
uniquely identify that resource. Each context key-value pair specifies a unique resource that
contains the targeted resource.

Type: Array of [PhysicalResourceIdContextKeyValuePair](api-physicalresourceidcontextkeyvaluepair.md) objects

Array Members: Maximum number of 5 items.

Required: No

**PropertyDifferences.member.N**

Status of the actual configuration of the resource compared to its expected configuration.
These will be present only for resources whose `StackInstanceResourceDriftStatus` is
`MODIFIED`.

Type: Array of [PropertyDifference](api-propertydifference.md) objects

Required: No
