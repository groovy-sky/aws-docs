# RequiredActivatedType

For extensions that are modules, a public third-party extension that must be activated in
your account in order for the module itself to be activated.

For more information, see [Requirements for activating third-party public modules](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/module-versioning.md#requirements-for-modules) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

## Contents

**OriginalTypeName**

The type name of the public extension.

If you specified a `TypeNameAlias` when enabling the extension in this account
and Region, CloudFormation treats that alias as the extension's type name within the account and
Region, not the type name of the public extension. For more information, see [Use\
aliases to refer to extensions](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/registry-public.md#registry-public-enable-alias) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.
