# DescribeType

Returns detailed information about an extension from the CloudFormation registry in your
current account and Region.

If you specify a `VersionId`, `DescribeType` returns information
about that specific extension version. Otherwise, it returns information about the default
extension version.

For more information, see [Edit configuration\
data for extensions in your account](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/registry-set-configuration.md) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

## Response Elements

The following elements are returned by the service.

**Arn**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension.

Type: String

Pattern: `arn:aws[A-Za-z0-9-]{0,64}:cloudformation:[A-Za-z0-9-]{1,64}:([0-9]{12})?:type/.+`

**AutoUpdate**

Whether CloudFormation automatically updates the extension in this account and Region when a
new _minor_ version is published by the extension publisher. Major versions
released by the publisher must be manually updated. For more information, see [Automatically use new versions of extensions](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/registry-public-registry-public-enable-auto.md) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

Type: Boolean

**ConfigurationSchema**

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 60000.

Pattern: `[\s\S]+`

**DefaultVersionId**

The ID of the default version of the extension. The default version is used when the
extension version isn't specified.

This applies only to private extensions you have registered in your account. For public
extensions, both those provided by AWS and published by third parties, CloudFormation returns
`null`. For more information, see [RegisterType](api-registertype.md).

To set the default version of an extension, use [SetTypeDefaultVersion](api-settypedefaultversion.md).

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Pattern: `[A-Za-z0-9-]+`

**DeprecatedStatus**

The deprecation status of the extension version.

Valid values include:

- `LIVE`: The extension is activated or registered and can be used in
CloudFormation operations, dependent on its provisioning behavior and visibility scope.

- `DEPRECATED`: The extension has been deactivated or deregistered and can no
longer be used in CloudFormation operations.

For public third-party extensions, CloudFormation returns `null`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `LIVE | DEPRECATED`

**Description**

The description of the extension.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

The URL of a page providing detailed documentation for this extension.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 4096.

**ExecutionRoleArn**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM execution role used to register the extension.
This applies only to private extensions you have registered in your account. For more
information, see [RegisterType](api-registertype.md).

If the registered extension calls any AWS APIs, you must create an _[IAM execution\_
_role](../../../../services/iam/latest/userguide/id-roles.md)_ that includes the necessary permissions to call those AWS APIs,
and provision that execution role in your account. CloudFormation then assumes that execution role
to provide your extension with the appropriate credentials.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 256.

Pattern: `arn:.+:iam::[0-9]{12}:role/.+`

**IsActivated**

Whether the extension is activated in the account and Region.

This only applies to public third-party extensions. For all other extensions, CloudFormation
returns `null`.

Type: Boolean

**IsDefaultVersion**

Whether the specified extension version is set as the default version.

This applies only to private extensions you have registered in your account, and
extensions published by AWS. For public third-party extensions, whether they are activated
in your account, CloudFormation returns `null`.

Type: Boolean

**LastUpdated**

When the specified extension version was registered. This applies only to:

- Private extensions you have registered in your account. For more information, see
[RegisterType](api-registertype.md).

- Public extensions you have activated in your account with auto-update specified. For
more information, see [ActivateType](api-activatetype.md).

Type: Timestamp

**LatestPublicVersion**

The latest version of a public extension _that is available_ for
use.

This only applies if you specify a public extension, and you don't specify a version. For
all other requests, CloudFormation returns `null`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 5.

Pattern: `^(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(.*)$`

**LoggingConfig**

Contains logging configuration information for private extensions. This applies only to
private extensions you have registered in your account. For public extensions, both those
provided by AWS and published by third parties, CloudFormation returns `null`. For
more information, see [RegisterType](api-registertype.md).

Type: [LoggingConfig](api-loggingconfig.md) object

**OriginalTypeArn**

For public extensions that have been activated for this account and Region, the Amazon
Resource Name (ARN) of the public extension.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 1024.

Pattern: `arn:aws[A-Za-z0-9-]{0,64}:cloudformation:[A-Za-z0-9-]{1,64}:([0-9]{12})?:type/.+`

**OriginalTypeName**

For public extensions that have been activated for this account and Region, the type name
of the public extension.

If you specified a `TypeNameAlias` when enabling the extension in this account
and Region, CloudFormation treats that alias as the extension's type name within the account and
Region, not the type name of the public extension. For more information, see [Use aliases to refer to extensions](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/registry-public-registry-public-enable-alias.md) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 10. Maximum length of 204.

Pattern: `[A-Za-z0-9]{2,64}::[A-Za-z0-9]{2,64}::[A-Za-z0-9]{2,64}(::MODULE){0,1}`

**ProvisioningType**

For resource type extensions, the provisioning behavior of the resource type. CloudFormation
determines the provisioning type during registration, based on the types of handlers in the
schema handler package submitted.

Valid values include:

- `FULLY_MUTABLE`: The resource type includes an update handler to process
updates to the type during stack update operations.

- `IMMUTABLE`: The resource type doesn't include an update handler, so the
type can't be updated and must instead be replaced during stack update operations.

- `NON_PROVISIONABLE`: The resource type doesn't include all the following
handlers, and therefore can't actually be provisioned.

- create

- read

- delete

Type: String

Valid Values: `NON_PROVISIONABLE | IMMUTABLE | FULLY_MUTABLE`

**PublicVersionNumber**

The version number of a public third-party extension.

This applies only if you specify a public extension you have activated in your account, or
specify a public extension without specifying a version. For all other extensions, CloudFormation
returns `null`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 5.

Pattern: `^(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(.*)$`

**PublisherId**

The publisher ID of the extension publisher.

This applies only to public third-party extensions. For private registered extensions, and
extensions provided by AWS, CloudFormation returns `null`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 40.

Pattern: `[0-9a-zA-Z]{12,40}`

**RequiredActivatedTypes.member.N**

For extensions that are modules, the public third-party extensions that must be activated
in your account in order for the module itself to be activated.

Type: Array of [RequiredActivatedType](api-requiredactivatedtype.md) objects

**Type**

The kind of extension.

Type: String

Valid Values: `RESOURCE | MODULE | HOOK`

**TypeName**

The name of the extension.

If the extension is a public third-party type you have activated with a type name alias,

Pattern: `[A-Za-z0-9]{2,64}::[A-Za-z0-9]{2,64}::[A-Za-z0-9]{2,64}(::MODULE){0,1}`

**TypeTestsStatus**

The contract test status of the registered extension version. To return the extension test
status of a specific extension version, you must specify `VersionId`.

This applies only to registered private extension versions. CloudFormation doesn't return this
information for public extensions, whether they are activated in your account.

- `PASSED`: The extension has passed all its contract tests.

An extension must have a test status of `PASSED` before it can be
published. For more information, see [Publishing\
extensions to make them available for public use](../../../../services/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-publish.md) in the
_AWS CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide_.
