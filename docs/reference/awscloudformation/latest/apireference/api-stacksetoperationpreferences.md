# StackSetOperationPreferences

The user-specified preferences for how CloudFormation performs a StackSet operation.

For more information about maximum concurrent accounts and failure tolerance, see [StackSet\
operation options](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/stacksets-concepts.md#stackset-ops-options).

###### Note

`StackSetOperationPreferences` don't apply to `AutoDeployment`, even
if it's enabled.

## Contents

**ConcurrencyMode**

Specifies how the concurrency level behaves during the operation execution.

- `STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE`: This option dynamically lowers the concurrency
level to ensure the number of failed accounts never exceeds the value of
`FailureToleranceCount` +1\. The initial actual concurrency is set to the lower of
either the value of the `MaxConcurrentCount`, or the value of
`FailureToleranceCount` +1\. The actual concurrency is then reduced proportionally
by the number of failures. This is the default behavior.

If failure tolerance or Maximum concurrent accounts are set to percentages, the behavior
is similar.

- `SOFT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE`: This option decouples
`FailureToleranceCount` from the actual concurrency. This allows StackSet
operations to run at the concurrency level set by the `MaxConcurrentCount` value, or
`MaxConcurrentPercentage`, regardless of the number of failures.

Type: String

Valid Values: `STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE | SOFT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE`

Required: No

**FailureToleranceCount**

The number of accounts per Region this operation can fail in before CloudFormation stops the
operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation doesn't attempt the
operation in any subsequent Regions.

You can specify either `FailureToleranceCount` or
`FailureTolerancePercentage`, but not both.

By default, `0` is specified.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.

Required: No

**FailureTolerancePercentage**

The percentage of accounts per Region this stack operation can fail in before CloudFormation
stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation doesn't
attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, CloudFormation rounds
_down_ to the next whole number.

You can specify either `FailureToleranceCount` or
`FailureTolerancePercentage`, but not both.

By default, `0` is specified.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0. Maximum value of 100.

Required: No

**MaxConcurrentCount**

The maximum number of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time. This can
depend on the value of `FailureToleranceCount` depending on your
`ConcurrencyMode`. `MaxConcurrentCount` is at most one more than the
`FailureToleranceCount` if you're using `STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE`.

Note that this setting lets you specify the _maximum_ for operations. For
large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon
concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

You can specify either `MaxConcurrentCount` or
`MaxConcurrentPercentage`, but not both.

By default, `1` is specified.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1.

Required: No

**MaxConcurrentPercentage**

The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time.

When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, CloudFormation rounds
down to the next whole number. This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is
zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number as one instead.

Note that this setting lets you specify the _maximum_ for operations. For
large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon
concurrently may be lower due to service throttling.

You can specify either `MaxConcurrentCount` or
`MaxConcurrentPercentage`, but not both.

By default, `1` is specified.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 100.

Required: No

**RegionConcurrencyType**

The concurrency type of deploying StackSets operations in Regions, could be in parallel or
one Region at a time.

Type: String

Valid Values: `SEQUENTIAL | PARALLEL`

Required: No

**RegionOrder.member.N**

The order of the Regions where you want to perform the stack operation.

Type: Array of strings

Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,128}$`

Required: No
