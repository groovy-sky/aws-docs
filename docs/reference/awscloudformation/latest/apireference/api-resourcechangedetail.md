# ResourceChangeDetail

For a resource with `Modify` as the action, the `ResourceChange`
structure describes the changes CloudFormation will make to that resource.

## Contents

**CausingEntity**

The identity of the entity that triggered this change. This entity is a member of the group
that's specified by the `ChangeSource` field. For example, if you modified the value
of the `KeyPairName` parameter, the `CausingEntity` is the name of the
parameter ( `KeyPairName`).

If the `ChangeSource` value is `DirectModification`, no value is given
for `CausingEntity`.

Type: String

Required: No

**ChangeSource**

The group to which the `CausingEntity` value belongs. There are five entity
groups:

- `ResourceReference` entities are `Ref` intrinsic functions that refer to
resources in the template, such as `{ "Ref" : "MyEC2InstanceResource" }`.

- `ParameterReference` entities are `Ref` intrinsic functions that get
template parameter values, such as `{ "Ref" : "MyPasswordParameter" }`.

- `ResourceAttribute` entities are `Fn::GetAtt` intrinsic functions that
get resource attribute values, such as `{ "Fn::GetAtt" : [ "MyEC2InstanceResource",
        "PublicDnsName" ] }`.

- `DirectModification` entities are changes that are made directly to the
template.

- `Automatic` entities are `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` resource types,
which are also known as nested stacks. If you made no changes to the
`AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` resource, CloudFormation sets the
`ChangeSource` to `Automatic` because the nested stack's template might
have changed. Changes to a nested stack's template aren't visible to CloudFormation until you run
an update on the parent stack.

- `NoModification` entities are changes made to the template that matches the actual
state of the resource.

Type: String

Valid Values: `ResourceReference | ParameterReference | ResourceAttribute | DirectModification | Automatic | NoModification`

Required: No

**Evaluation**

Indicates whether CloudFormation can determine the target value, and whether the target value
will change before you execute a change set.

For `Static` evaluations, CloudFormation can determine that the target value will
change, and its value. For example, if you directly modify the `InstanceType` property
of an EC2 instance, CloudFormation knows that this property value will change, and its value, so this
is a `Static` evaluation.

For `Dynamic` evaluations, can't determine the target value because it depends on
the result of an intrinsic function, such as a `Ref` or `Fn::GetAtt`
intrinsic function, when the stack is updated. For example, if your template includes a reference
to a resource that's conditionally recreated, the value of the reference (the physical ID of the
resource) might change, depending on if the resource is recreated. If the resource is recreated,
it will have a new physical ID, so all references to that resource will also be updated.

Type: String

Valid Values: `Static | Dynamic`

Required: No

**Target**

A `ResourceTargetDefinition` structure that describes the field that CloudFormation
will change and whether the resource will be recreated.

Type: [ResourceTargetDefinition](api-resourcetargetdefinition.md) object

Required: No
