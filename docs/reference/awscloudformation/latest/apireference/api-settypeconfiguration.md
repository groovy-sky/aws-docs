# SetTypeConfiguration

Specifies the configuration data for a CloudFormation extension, such as a resource or Hook,
in the given account and Region.

For more information, see [Edit configuration\
data for extensions in your account](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/registry-set-configuration.md) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

To view the current configuration data for an extension, refer to the
`ConfigurationSchema` element of [DescribeType](api-describetype.md).

###### Important

It's strongly recommended that you use dynamic references to restrict sensitive
configuration definitions, such as third-party credentials. For more information, see [Specify values stored in other services using dynamic references](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/dynamic-references.md) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

For more information about setting the configuration data for resource types, see [Defining the account-level configuration of an extension](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-model.html#resource-type-howto-configuration) in the
_AWS CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide_. For more information about setting the configuration
data for Hooks, see the [CloudFormation Hooks User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/hooks-userguide/what-is-cloudformation-hooks.html).

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 204800.

Pattern: `[\s\S]+`

Required: Yes

**ConfigurationAlias**

An alias by which to refer to this extension configuration data.

Conditional: Specifying a configuration alias is required when setting a configuration for
a resource type extension.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 256.

Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,256}$`

configuration for an extension, but not for a specific extension version.

Type: String
