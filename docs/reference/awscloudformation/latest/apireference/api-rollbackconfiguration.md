# RollbackConfiguration

Structure that contains the rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during stack
creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.

Rollback triggers enable you to have CloudFormation monitor the state of your application during
stack creation and updating, and to roll back that operation if the application breaches the
threshold of any of the alarms you've specified. For more information, see [Roll back your CloudFormation stack on alarm breach with rollback triggers](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/using-cfn-rollback-triggers.md).

## Contents

**MonitoringTimeInMinutes**

The amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback
triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

The default is 0 minutes.

If you specify a monitoring period but don't specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still
waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You
can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually
cancel the stack creation or update (using [CancelUpdateStack](api-cancelupdatestack.md), for example) as necessary.

If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback
triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins
disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0. Maximum value of 180.

Required: No

**RollbackTriggers.member.N**

The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions.

By default, CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to
any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify
rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously
specified for the stack. This means:

- To use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don't specify
this parameter.

- To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify _all_ the
triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you've specified before (for example,
when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don't include
in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack.

- To remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this
parameter.

If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled
back.

Type: Array of [RollbackTrigger](api-rollbacktrigger.md) objects

Array Members: Maximum number of 5 items.

Required: No
