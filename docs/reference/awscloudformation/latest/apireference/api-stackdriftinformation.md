# StackDriftInformation

Contains information about whether the stack's actual configuration differs, or has
_drifted_, from its expected configuration, as defined in the stack template
and any values specified as template parameters. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or
more of its resources have drifted.

## Contents

**StackDriftStatus**

Status of the stack's actual configuration compared to its expected template
configuration.

- `DRIFTED`: The stack differs from its expected template configuration. A stack
is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources have drifted.

- `NOT_CHECKED`: CloudFormation hasn't checked if the stack differs from its expected
template configuration.

- `IN_SYNC`: The stack's actual configuration matches its expected template
configuration.

- `UNKNOWN`: CloudFormation could not run drift detection for a resource in the
stack.

Type: String

Valid Values: `DRIFTED | IN_SYNC | UNKNOWN | NOT_CHECKED`

Required: Yes

**LastCheckTimestamp**

Most recent time when a drift detection operation was initiated on the stack, or any of its
individual resources that support drift detection.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No
