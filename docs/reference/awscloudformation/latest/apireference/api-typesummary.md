extension version isn't specified.

This applies only to private extensions you have registered in your account. For public
extensions, both those provided by Amazon and published by third parties, CloudFormation returns
`null`. For more information, see [RegisterType](api-registertype.md).

To set the default version of an extension, use [SetTypeDefaultVersion](api-settypedefaultversion.md).

If you specified a `TypeNameAlias` when enabling the extension in this account
and Region, CloudFormation treats that alias as the extension's type name within the account and
Region, not the type name of the public extension. For more information, see [Use\
aliases to refer to extensions](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/registry-public.md#registry-public-enable-alias) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.
