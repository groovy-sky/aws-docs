# RegisterType

Registers an extension with the CloudFormation service. Registering an extension makes it
available for use in CloudFormation templates in your AWS account, and includes:

- Validating the extension schema.

- Determining which handlers, if any, have been specified for the extension.

- Making the extension available for use in your account.

For more information about how to develop extensions and ready them for registration, see
[Creating resource types using the CloudFormation CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-types.html) in the
_AWS CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide_.

You can have a maximum of 50 resource extension versions registered at a time. This
maximum is per account and per Region. Use [DeregisterType](api-deregistertype.md)
to deregister specific extension versions if necessary.

Once you have initiated a registration request using RegisterType, you
can use [DescribeTypeRegistration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTypeRegistration.html) to monitor the progress of the registration
request.

Once you have registered a private extension in your account and Region, use [SetTypeConfiguration](api-settypeconfiguration.md) to specify configuration properties for the extension. For
more information, see [Edit configuration\
data for extensions in your account](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/registry-set-configuration.md) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**ClientRequestToken**

A unique identifier that acts as an idempotency key for this registration request.
Specifying a client request token prevents CloudFormation from generating more than one version of
an extension from the same registration request, even if the request is submitted multiple
times.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9][-a-zA-Z0-9]*`

Required: No

**ExecutionRoleArn**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role for CloudFormation to assume when invoking
the extension.

For CloudFormation to assume the specified execution role, the role must contain a trust
relationship with the CloudFormation service principal
( `resources.cloudformation.amazonaws.com`). For more information about adding
trust relationships, see [Modifying a role trust policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-managingrole-editing-console.html#roles-managingrole_edit-trust-policy) in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User_
_Guide_.

If your extension calls AWS APIs in any of its handlers, you must create an
_[IAM\_
_execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)_ that includes the necessary permissions to call those
AWS APIs, and provision that execution role in your account. When CloudFormation needs to invoke
the resource type handler, CloudFormation assumes this execution role to create a temporary
session token, which it then passes to the resource type handler, thereby supplying your
resource type with the appropriate credentials.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 256.

Pattern: `arn:.+:iam::[0-9]{12}:role/.+`

Required: No

**LoggingConfig**

Specifies logging configuration information for an extension.

Type: [LoggingConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_LoggingConfig.html) object

Required: No

**SchemaHandlerPackage**

A URL to the S3 bucket that contains the extension project package that contains the
necessary files for the extension you want to register.

For information about generating a schema handler package for the extension you want to
register, see [submit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-cli-submit.html) in
the _AWS CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide_.

###### Note

The user registering the extension must be able to access the package in the S3 bucket.
That's, the user needs to have [GetObject](../../../../services/s3/latest/api/api-getobject.md) permissions for the schema
handler package. For more information, see [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for\
Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazons3.html) in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide_.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 4096.

Required: Yes

**Type**

The kind of extension.

Type: String

Valid Values: `RESOURCE | MODULE | HOOK`

Required: No

**TypeName**

The name of the extension being registered.

We suggest that extension names adhere to the following patterns:

- For resource types, `company_or_organization::service::type`.

- For modules, `company_or_organization::service::type::MODULE`.

- For Hooks, `MyCompany::Testing::MyTestHook`.

###### Note

The following organization namespaces are reserved and can't be used in your extension
names:

- `Alexa`

- `AMZN`

- `Amazon`

- `AWS`

- `Custom`

- `Dev`

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 10. Maximum length of 204.

Pattern: `[A-Za-z0-9]{2,64}::[A-Za-z0-9]{2,64}::[A-Za-z0-9]{2,64}(::MODULE){0,1}`

Required: Yes

## Response Elements

The following element is returned by the service.

**RegistrationToken**

The identifier for this registration request.

Use this registration token when calling [DescribeTypeRegistration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTypeRegistration.html), which
returns information about the status and IDs of the extension registration.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9][-a-zA-Z0-9]*`

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**CFNRegistry**

An error occurred during a CloudFormation registry operation.

**Message**

A message with details about the error that occurred.

HTTP Status Code: 400
