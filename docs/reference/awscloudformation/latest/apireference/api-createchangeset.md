# CreateChangeSet

Creates a list of changes that will be applied to a stack so that you can review the
changes before executing them. You can create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist or
an existing stack. If you create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, the change set
shows all of the resources that CloudFormation will create. If you create a change set for an
existing stack, CloudFormation compares the stack's information with the information that you
submit in the change set and lists the differences. Use change sets to understand which
resources CloudFormation will create or change, and how it will change resources in an existing
stack, before you create or update a stack.

To create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, for the `ChangeSetType`
parameter, specify `CREATE`. To create a change set for an existing stack, specify
`UPDATE` for the `ChangeSetType` parameter. To create a change set for
an import operation, specify `IMPORT` for the `ChangeSetType` parameter.
After the `CreateChangeSet` call successfully completes, CloudFormation starts creating
the change set. To check the status of the change set or to review it, use the [DescribeChangeSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeChangeSet.html) action.

When you are satisfied with the changes the change set will make, execute the change set
by using the [ExecuteChangeSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ExecuteChangeSet.html) action. CloudFormation doesn't make changes until
you execute the change set.

To create a change set for the entire stack hierarchy, set
`IncludeNestedStacks` to `True`.

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**Capabilities.member.N**

In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain
capabilities in order for CloudFormation to create the stack.

- `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`

Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your
AWS account, for example, by creating new IAM users. For those stacks, you must
explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities.

The following IAM resources require you to specify either the
`CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability.

- If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.

- If you have IAM resources with custom names, you _must_
specify `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`.

- If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an
`InsufficientCapabilities` error.

If your stack template contains these resources, we suggest that you review all
permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

- [AWS::IAM::AccessKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-accesskey.html)

- [AWS::IAM::Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-group.html)

- [AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-instanceprofile.html)

- [AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-managedpolicy.html)

- [AWS::IAM::Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-policy.html)

- [AWS::IAM::Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-role.html)

- [AWS::IAM::User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-user.html)

- [AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-usertogroupaddition.html)

For more information, see [Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/control-access-with-iam.md#using-iam-capabilities).

- `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`

Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can
include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive
transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set
from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros
before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros,
and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first
reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability.
This includes the [AWS::Include](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-include.html)
and [AWS::Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html) transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.

###### Note

This capacity doesn't apply to creating change sets, and specifying it when creating
change sets has no effect.

If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros
_and_ nested stacks, you must create or update the stack directly
from the template using the [CreateStack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStack.html) or [UpdateStack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateStack.html) action, and specifying this capability.

For more information about macros, see [Perform custom processing\
on CloudFormation templates with template macros](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html).

###### Note

Only one of the `Capabilities` and `ResourceType` parameters can
be specified.

Type: Array of strings

Valid Values: `CAPABILITY_IAM | CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM | CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`

Required: No

**ChangeSetName**

The name of the change set. The name must be unique among all change sets that are
associated with the specified stack.

A change set name can contain only alphanumeric, case sensitive characters, and hyphens.
It must start with an alphabetical character and can't exceed 128 characters.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Pattern: `[a-zA-Z][-a-zA-Z0-9]*`

Required: Yes

**ChangeSetType**

The type of change set operation. To create a change set for a new stack, specify
`CREATE`. To create a change set for an existing stack, specify
`UPDATE`. To create a change set for an import operation, specify
`IMPORT`.

If you create a change set for a new stack, CloudFormation creates a stack with a unique stack
ID, but no template or resources. The stack will be in the `REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS`
state until you execute the change set.

By default, CloudFormation specifies `UPDATE`. You can't use the
`UPDATE` type to create a change set for a new stack or the `CREATE`
type to create a change set for an existing stack.

Type: String

Valid Values: `CREATE | UPDATE | IMPORT`

Required: No

**ClientToken**

A unique identifier for this `CreateChangeSet` request. Specify this token if
you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create
another change set with the same name. You might retry `CreateChangeSet` requests
to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Required: No

**DeploymentMode**

Determines how CloudFormation handles configuration drift during deployment.

- `REVERT_DRIFT` – Creates a drift-aware change set that brings actual
resource states in line with template definitions. Provides a three-way comparison between
actual state, previous deployment state, and desired state.

For more information, see [Using drift-aware\
change sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/drift-aware-change-sets.html) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

Type: String

Valid Values: `REVERT_DRIFT`

Required: No

**Description**

A description to help you identify this change set.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

Required: No

**ImportExistingResources**

Indicates if the change set auto-imports resources that already exist. For more
information, see [Import AWS\
resources into a CloudFormation stack automatically](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/import-resources-automatically.html) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

###### Note

This parameter can only import resources that have custom names in templates. For more
information, see [name\
type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-properties-name.html) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_. To import resources that do not
accept custom names, such as EC2 instances, use the `ResourcesToImport` parameter
instead.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**IncludeNestedStacks**

Creates a change set for the all nested stacks specified in the template. The default
behavior of this action is set to `False`. To include nested sets in a change set,
specify `True`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**NotificationARNs.member.N**

The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of Amazon SNS topics that CloudFormation associates with the
stack. To remove all associated notification topics, specify an empty list.

Type: Array of strings

Array Members: Maximum number of 5 items.

Required: No

**OnStackFailure**

Determines what action will be taken if stack creation fails. If this parameter is
specified, the `DisableRollback` parameter to the [ExecuteChangeSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ExecuteChangeSet.html) API operation must not be specified. This must be one of these
values:

- `DELETE` \- Deletes the change set if the stack creation fails. This is only
valid when the `ChangeSetType` parameter is set to `CREATE`. If the
deletion of the stack fails, the status of the stack is `DELETE_FAILED`.

- `DO_NOTHING` \- if the stack creation fails, do nothing. This is equivalent
to specifying `true` for the `DisableRollback` parameter to the
[ExecuteChangeSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ExecuteChangeSet.html) API operation.

- `ROLLBACK` \- if the stack creation fails, roll back the stack. This is
equivalent to specifying `false` for the `DisableRollback` parameter
to the [ExecuteChangeSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ExecuteChangeSet.html) API operation.

For nested stacks, when the `OnStackFailure` parameter is set to
`DELETE` for the change set for the parent stack, any failure in a child stack
will cause the parent stack creation to fail and all stacks to be deleted.

Type: String

Valid Values: `DO_NOTHING | ROLLBACK | DELETE`

Required: No

**Parameters.member.N**

A list of `Parameter` structures that specify input parameters for the change
set. For more information, see the [Parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Parameter.html) data type.

Type: Array of [Parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Parameter.html) objects

Required: No

**ResourcesToImport.member.N**

The resources to import into your stack.

Type: Array of [ResourceToImport](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ResourceToImport.html) objects

Array Members: Maximum number of 200 items.

Required: No

**ResourceTypes.member.N**

Specifies which resource types you can work with, such as `AWS::EC2::Instance`
or `Custom::MyCustomInstance`.

If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource type that you're updating, the
stack update fails. By default, CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. IAM
uses this parameter for condition keys in IAM policies for CloudFormation. For more information,
see [Control CloudFormation\
access with AWS Identity and Access Management](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/control-access-with-iam.md) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

###### Note

Only one of the `Capabilities` and `ResourceType` parameters can
be specified.

Type: Array of strings

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 256.

Required: No

**RoleARN**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that CloudFormation assumes when executing the
change set. CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation
uses this role for all future operations on the stack. Provided that users have permission to
operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to
pass it. Ensure that the role grants least permission.

If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with
the stack. If no role is available, CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from
your user credentials.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 20. Maximum length of 2048.

Required: No

**RollbackConfiguration**

The rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating
operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.

Type: [RollbackConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RollbackConfiguration.html) object

Required: No

**StackName**

The name or the unique ID of the stack for which you are creating a change set. CloudFormation
generates the change set by comparing this stack's information with the information that you
submit, such as a modified template or different parameter input values.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.

Pattern: `([a-zA-Z][-a-zA-Z0-9]*)|(arn:\b(aws|aws-us-gov|aws-cn)\b:[-a-zA-Z0-9:/._+]*)`

Required: Yes

**Tags.member.N**

Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. CloudFormation also propagates these tags to
resources in the stack. You can specify a maximum of 50 tags.

Type: Array of [Tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Tag.html) objects

Array Members: Maximum number of 50 items.

Required: No

**TemplateBody**

A structure that contains the body of the revised template, with a minimum length of 1
byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. CloudFormation generates the change set by comparing
this template with the template of the stack that you specified.

Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters:
`TemplateBody`, `TemplateURL`, or set the
`UsePreviousTemplate` to `true`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.

Required: No

**TemplateURL**

The URL of the file that contains the revised template. The URL must point to a template
(max size: 1 MB) that's located in an Amazon S3 bucket or a Systems Manager document. CloudFormation
generates the change set by comparing this template with the stack that you specified. The
location for an Amazon S3 bucket must start with `https://`. URLs from S3 static
websites are not supported.

Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters:
`TemplateBody`, `TemplateURL`, or set the
`UsePreviousTemplate` to `true`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 5120.

Required: No

**UsePreviousTemplate**

Whether to reuse the template that's associated with the stack to create the change
set.

When using templates with the `AWS::LanguageExtensions` transform, provide the
template instead of using `UsePreviousTemplate` to ensure new parameter values and
Systems Manager parameter updates are applied correctly. For more information, see [AWS::LanguageExtensions transform](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/templatereference/transform-aws-languageextensions.md).

Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters:
`TemplateBody`, `TemplateURL`, or set the
`UsePreviousTemplate` to `true`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

## Response Elements

The following elements are returned by the service.

**Id**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the change set.
