# DeleteStackSet

Deletes a StackSet. Before you can delete a StackSet, all its member stack instances must
be deleted. For more information about how to complete this, see [DeleteStackInstances](api-deletestackinstances.md).

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**CallAs**

\[Service-managed permissions\] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator
in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a
member account.

By default, `SELF` is specified. Use `SELF` for StackSets with
self-managed permissions.

- If you are signed in to the management account, specify
`SELF`.

- If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
`DELEGATED_ADMIN`.

Your AWS account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more information, see [Register a\
delegated administrator](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/stacksets-orgs-delegated-admin.md) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

Valid Values: `SELF | DELEGATED_ADMIN`

**StackSetName**

The name or unique ID of the StackSet that you're deleting. You can obtain this value by
running [ListStackSets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ListStackSets.html).

Type: String

Required: Yes

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

Another operation is currently in progress for this StackSet. Only one operation can be performed for a stack
set at a given time.
