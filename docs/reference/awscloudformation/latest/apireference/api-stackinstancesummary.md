# StackInstanceSummary

The structure that contains summary information about a stack instance.

## Contents

**Account**

\[Self-managed permissions\] The name of the AWS account that the stack instance is
associated with.

Type: String

Pattern: `^[0-9]{12}$`

Required: No

**DriftStatus**

Status of the stack instance's actual configuration compared to the expected template and
parameter configuration of the StackSet it belongs to.

- `DRIFTED`: The stack differs from the expected template and parameter
configuration of the StackSet it belongs to. A stack instance is considered to have drifted if
one or more of the resources in the associated stack have drifted.

- `NOT_CHECKED`: CloudFormation hasn't checked if the stack instance differs from its
expected StackSet configuration.

- `IN_SYNC`: The stack instance's actual configuration matches its expected
StackSet configuration.

- `UNKNOWN`: This value is reserved for future use.

Type: String

Valid Values: `DRIFTED | IN_SYNC | UNKNOWN | NOT_CHECKED`

Required: No

**LastDriftCheckTimestamp**

Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detection operation on the stack
instance. This value will be `NULL` for any stack instance that drift detection hasn't
yet been performed on.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**LastOperationId**

The last unique ID of a StackSet operation performed on a stack instance.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9][-a-zA-Z0-9]*`

Required: No

**OrganizationalUnitId**

\[Service-managed permissions\] The organization root ID or organizational unit (OU) IDs that
you specified for [DeploymentTargets](api-deploymenttargets.md).

Type: String

Pattern: `^(ou-[a-z0-9]{4,32}-[a-z0-9]{8,32}|r-[a-z0-9]{4,32})$`

Required: No

**Region**

The name of the AWS Region that the stack instance is associated with.

Type: String

Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,128}$`

Required: No

**StackId**

The ID of the stack instance.

Type: String

Required: No

**StackInstanceStatus**

The detailed status of the stack instance.

Type: [StackInstanceComprehensiveStatus](api-stackinstancecomprehensivestatus.md) object

Required: No

**StackSetId**

The name or unique ID of the StackSet that the stack instance is associated with.

Type: String

Required: No

**Status**

The status of the stack instance, in terms of its synchronization with its associated stack
set.

- `INOPERABLE`: A `DeleteStackInstances` operation has failed and left
the stack in an unstable state. Stacks in this state are excluded from further
`UpdateStackSet` operations. You might need to perform a
`DeleteStackInstances` operation, with `RetainStacks` set to
`true`, to delete the stack instance, and then delete the stack manually.
`INOPERABLE` can be returned here when the cause is a failed import. If it's due to
a failed import, the operation can be retried once the failures are fixed. To see if this is
due to a failed import, call the [DescribeStackInstance](api-describestackinstance.md) API operation, look at
the `DetailedStatus` member returned in the `StackInstanceSummary`
member.

- `OUTDATED`: The stack isn't currently up to date with the StackSet
because:

- The associated stack failed during a `CreateStackSet` or
`UpdateStackSet` operation.

- The stack was part of a `CreateStackSet` or `UpdateStackSet`
operation that failed or was stopped before the stack was created or updated.

- `CURRENT`: The stack is currently up to date with the StackSet.

Type: String

Valid Values: `CURRENT | OUTDATED | INOPERABLE`

Required: No

**StatusReason**

The explanation for the specific status code assigned to this stack instance.

Type: String

Required: No
