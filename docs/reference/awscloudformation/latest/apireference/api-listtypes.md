# ListTypes

Returns summary information about all extensions, including your private resource types,
modules, and Hooks as well as all public extensions from AWS and third-party
publishers.

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**DeprecatedStatus**

The deprecation status of the extension that you want to get summary information
about.

Valid values include:

- `LIVE`: The extension is registered for use in CloudFormation
operations.

- `DEPRECATED`: The extension has been deregistered and can no longer be used
in CloudFormation operations.

Type: String

Valid Values: `LIVE | DEPRECATED`

Required: No

**Filters**

Filter criteria to use in determining which extensions to return.

Filters must be compatible with `Visibility` to return valid results. For
example, specifying `AWS_TYPES` for `Category` and `PRIVATE`
for `Visibility` returns an empty list of types, but specifying `PUBLIC`
for `Visibility` returns the desired list.

Type: [TypeFilters](api-typefilters.md) object

Required: No

**MaxResults**

The maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If the number of
available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes a `NextToken` value
that you can assign to the `NextToken` request parameter to get the next set of
results.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 100.

Required: No

**NextToken**

The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token from a previous
call.)

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

Required: No

**ProvisioningType**

For resource types, the provisioning behavior of the resource type. CloudFormation determines
the provisioning type during registration, based on the types of handlers in the schema
handler package submitted.

Valid values include:

- `FULLY_MUTABLE`: The resource type includes an update handler to process
updates to the type during stack update operations.

- `IMMUTABLE`: The resource type doesn't include an update handler, so the
type can't be updated and must instead be replaced during stack update operations.

- `NON_PROVISIONABLE`: The resource type doesn't include create, read, and
delete handlers, and therefore can't actually be provisioned.

The default is `FULLY_MUTABLE`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `NON_PROVISIONABLE | IMMUTABLE | FULLY_MUTABLE`

Required: No

**Type**

The type of extension.

Type: String

Valid Values: `RESOURCE | MODULE | HOOK`

Required: No

**Visibility**

The scope at which the extensions are visible and usable in CloudFormation operations.

Valid values include:

- `PRIVATE`: Extensions that are visible and usable within this account and
Region. This includes:

- Private extensions you have registered in this account and Region.

- Public extensions that you have activated in this account and Region.

- `PUBLIC`: Extensions that are publicly visible and available to be
activated within any AWS account. This includes extensions from AWS and third-party
publishers.

The default is `PRIVATE`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `PUBLIC | PRIVATE`

Required: No

## Response Elements

The following elements are returned by the service.

**NextToken**

If the request doesn't return all the remaining results, `NextToken` is set to
a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call this action again and assign that token to
the request object's `NextToken` parameter. If the request returns all results,
`NextToken` is set to `null`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

**TypeSummaries.member.N**

A list of `TypeSummary` structures that contain information about the specified
extensions.

Type: Array of [TypeSummary](api-typesummary.md) objects

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**CFNRegistry**

An error occurred during a CloudFormation registry operation.

**Message**

A message with details about the error that occurred.

HTTP Status Code: 400
