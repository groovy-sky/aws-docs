# StackResourceDrift
<a name="API_StackResourceDrift"></a>

Contains the drift information for a resource that has been checked for drift. This includes actual and expected property values for resources in which CloudFormation has detected drift. Only resource properties explicitly defined in the stack template are checked for drift. For more information, see [Detect unmanaged configuration changes to stacks and resources with drift detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html).

Resources that don't currently support drift detection can't be checked. For a list of resources that support drift detection, see [Resource type support for imports and drift detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-import-supported-resources.html).

Use [DetectStackResourceDrift](API_DetectStackResourceDrift.md) to detect drift on individual resources, or [DetectStackDrift](API_DetectStackDrift.md) to detect drift on all resources in a given stack that support drift detection.

## Contents
<a name="API_StackResourceDrift_Contents"></a>

 ** LogicalResourceId **
The logical name of the resource specified in the template.
Type: String
Required: Yes

 ** ResourceType **
The type of the resource.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 256.
Required: Yes

 ** StackId **
The ID of the stack.
Type: String
Required: Yes

 ** StackResourceDriftStatus **
Status of the resource's actual configuration compared to its expected configuration.
+  `DELETED`: The resource differs from its expected template configuration because the resource has been deleted.
+  `MODIFIED`: One or more resource properties differ from their expected values (as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters).
+  `IN_SYNC`: The resource's actual configuration matches its expected template configuration.
+  `NOT_CHECKED`: CloudFormation does not currently return this value.
+  `UNKNOWN`: CloudFormation could not run drift detection for the resource. See the `DriftStatusReason` for details.
Type: String
Valid Values: `IN_SYNC | MODIFIED | DELETED | NOT_CHECKED | UNKNOWN | UNSUPPORTED`
Required: Yes

 ** Timestamp **
Time at which CloudFormation performed drift detection on the stack resource.
Type: Timestamp
Required: Yes

 ** ActualProperties **
A JSON structure that contains the actual property values of the stack resource.
For resources whose `StackResourceDriftStatus` is `DELETED`, this structure will not be present.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** DriftStatusReason **
The reason for the drift status.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ExpectedProperties **
A JSON structure that contains the expected property values of the stack resource, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters.
For resources whose `StackResourceDriftStatus` is `DELETED`, this structure will not be present.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ModuleInfo **
Contains information about the module from which the resource was created, if the resource was created from a module included in the stack template.
Type: [ModuleInfo](API_ModuleInfo.md) object
Required: No

 ** PhysicalResourceId **
The name or unique identifier that corresponds to a physical instance ID of a resource supported by CloudFormation.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** PhysicalResourceIdContext.member.N **
Context information that enables CloudFormation to uniquely identify a resource. CloudFormation uses context key-value pairs in cases where a resource's logical and physical IDs aren't enough to uniquely identify that resource. Each context key-value pair specifies a unique resource that contains the targeted resource.
Type: Array of [PhysicalResourceIdContextKeyValuePair](API_PhysicalResourceIdContextKeyValuePair.md) objects
Array Members: Maximum number of 5 items.
Required: No

 ** PropertyDifferences.member.N **
A collection of the resource properties whose actual values differ from their expected values. These will be present only for resources whose `StackResourceDriftStatus` is `MODIFIED`.
Type: Array of [PropertyDifference](API_PropertyDifference.md) objects
Required: No
