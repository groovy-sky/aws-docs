# RegisterImage

Registers an AMI. When you're creating an instance-store backed AMI, registering the AMI
is the final step in the creation process. For more information about creating AMIs, see
[Create an AMI from a snapshot](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/creating-an-ami-ebs.md#creating-launching-ami-from-snapshot) and [Create an instance-store\
backed AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-instance-store.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

###### Note

For Amazon EBS-backed instances, [CreateImage](api-createimage.md) creates and registers the AMI
in a single request, so you don't have to register the AMI yourself. We recommend that you
always use [CreateImage](api-createimage.md) unless you have a specific reason to use
RegisterImage.

If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time. Any modifications you make to an AMI
backed by an instance store volume invalidates its registration. If you make changes to an
image, deregister the previous image and register the new image.

**Register a snapshot of a root device volume**

You can use `RegisterImage` to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI from a snapshot
of a root device volume. You specify the snapshot using a block device mapping. You can't set
the encryption state of the volume using the block device mapping. If the snapshot is
encrypted, or encryption by default is enabled, the root volume of an instance launched from
the AMI is encrypted.

For more information, see [Create an AMI from a snapshot](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/creating-an-ami-ebs.md#creating-launching-ami-from-snapshot) and [Use encryption with EBS-backed AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIEncryption.html)
in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

**AWS Marketplace product codes**

If any snapshots have AWS Marketplace product codes, they are copied to the new AMI.

In most cases, AMIs for Windows, RedHat, SUSE, and SQL Server require correct licensing
information to be present on the AMI. For more information, see [Understand AMI billing\
information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-billing-info.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_. When creating an AMI from
a snapshot, the `RegisterImage` operation derives the correct billing information
from the snapshot's metadata, but this requires the appropriate metadata to be present. To
verify if the correct billing information was applied, check the `PlatformDetails`
field on the new AMI. If the field is empty or doesn't match the expected operating system
code (for example, Windows, RedHat, SUSE, or SQL), the AMI creation was unsuccessful, and you
should discard the AMI and instead create the AMI from an instance.
For more information, see [Create an AMI\
from an instance](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/creating-an-ami-ebs.md#how-to-create-ebs-ami) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

If you purchase a Reserved Instance to apply to an On-Demand Instance that was launched
from an AMI with a billing product code, make sure that the Reserved Instance has the matching
billing product code. If you purchase a Reserved Instance without the matching billing product
code, the Reserved Instance is not applied to the On-Demand Instance. For information
about how to obtain the platform details and billing information of an AMI, see [Understand AMI\
billing information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-billing-info.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**Architecture**

The architecture of the AMI.

Default: For Amazon EBS-backed AMIs, `i386`. For instance store-backed AMIs, the
architecture specified in the manifest file.

Type: String

Valid Values: `i386 | x86_64 | arm64 | x86_64_mac | arm64_mac`

Required: No

**BillingProduct.N**

The billing product codes. Your account must be authorized to specify billing product
codes.

If your account is not authorized to specify billing product codes, you can publish AMIs
that include billable software and list them on the AWS Marketplace. You must first register as a seller
on the AWS Marketplace. For more information, see [Getting started as an AWS Marketplace seller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/user-guide-for-sellers.html) and [AMI-based products in AWS Marketplace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/ami-products.html) in the _AWS Marketplace Seller Guide_.

Type: Array of strings

Required: No

**BlockDeviceMapping.N**

The block device mapping entries.

If you specify an Amazon EBS volume using the ID of an Amazon EBS snapshot, you can't specify the
encryption state of the volume.

If you create an AMI on an Outpost, then all backing snapshots must be on the same Outpost
or in the Region of that Outpost. AMIs on an Outpost that include local snapshots can be used
to launch instances on the same Outpost only. For more information, [Create AMIs from\
local snapshots](../../../../services/ebs/latest/userguide/snapshots-outposts.md#ami) in the _Amazon EBS User Guide_.

Type: Array of [BlockDeviceMapping](api-blockdevicemapping.md) objects

Required: No

**BootMode**

The boot mode of the AMI. A value of `uefi-preferred` indicates that the AMI
supports both UEFI and Legacy BIOS.

###### Note

The operating system contained in the AMI must be configured to support the specified
boot mode.

For more information, see [Instance launch behavior with Amazon EC2\
boot modes](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/ami-boot.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

Type: String

Valid Values: `legacy-bios | uefi | uefi-preferred`

Required: No

**Description**

A description for your AMI.

Type: String

Required: No

**DryRun**

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request,
and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is
`DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**EnaSupport**

Set to `true` to enable enhanced networking with ENA for the AMI and any
instances that you launch from the AMI.

This option is supported only for HVM AMIs. Specifying this option with a PV AMI can make
instances launched from the AMI unreachable.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**ImageLocation**

The full path to your AMI manifest in Amazon S3 storage. The specified bucket must have the
`aws-exec-read` canned access control list (ACL) to ensure that it can be
accessed by Amazon EC2. For more information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl) in the
_Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**ImdsSupport**

Set to `v2.0` to indicate that IMDSv2 is specified in the AMI. Instances
launched from this AMI will have `HttpTokens` automatically set to
`required` so that, by default, the instance requires that IMDSv2 is used when
requesting instance metadata. In addition, `HttpPutResponseHopLimit` is set to
`2`. For more information, see [Configure the AMI](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/configuring-imds-new-instances.md#configure-IMDS-new-instances-ami-configuration) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.
