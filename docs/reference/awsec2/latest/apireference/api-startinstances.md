# StartInstances

Starts an Amazon EBS-backed instance that you've previously stopped.

Instances that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be quickly stopped and
started. When an instance is stopped, the compute resources are released and you are not
billed for instance usage. However, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and
continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. You can
restart your instance at any time. Every time you start your instance, Amazon EC2
charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for
instance usage.

Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be
restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM.

Performing this operation on an instance that uses an instance store as its root
device returns an error.

If you attempt to start a T3 instance with `host` tenancy and the
`unlimited` CPU credit option, the request fails. The
`unlimited` CPU credit option is not supported on Dedicated Hosts. Before
you start the instance, either change its CPU credit option to `standard`, or
change its tenancy to `default` or `dedicated`.

For more information, see [Stop and start Amazon EC2\
instances](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/stop-start.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**InstanceId.N**

The IDs of the instances.

Type: Array of strings

Required: Yes

## Response Elements

The following elements are returned by the service.

**instancesSet**

Information about the started instances.

Type: Array of [InstanceStateChange](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_InstanceStateChange.html) objects

**requestId**

The ID of the request.

Type: String

## Errors
