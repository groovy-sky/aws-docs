# DeleteVpcEndpoints

Deletes the specified VPC endpoints.

When you delete a gateway endpoint, we delete the endpoint routes in the route tables for the endpoint.

When you delete a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, we delete its endpoint network interfaces.
You can only delete Gateway Load Balancer endpoints when the routes that are associated with the endpoint are deleted.

When you delete an interface endpoint, we delete its endpoint network interfaces.
