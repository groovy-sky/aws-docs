# CreateDhcpOptions

Creates a custom set of DHCP options. After you create a DHCP option set, you associate
it with a VPC. After you associate a DHCP option set with a VPC, all existing and newly
launched instances in the VPC use this set of DHCP options.

The following are the individual DHCP options you can specify. For more information, see
[DHCP option sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- `domain-name` \- If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in `us-east-1`,
specify `ec2.internal`. If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in any other Region,
specify `region.compute.internal`. Otherwise, specify a custom domain name.
This value is used to complete unqualified DNS hostnames.

Some Linux operating systems accept multiple domain names separated by spaces.
However, Windows and other Linux operating systems treat the value as a single
domain, which results in unexpected behavior. If your DHCP option set is
associated with a VPC that has instances running operating systems that treat
the value as a single domain, specify only one domain name.

- `domain-name-servers` \- The IP addresses of up to four DNS servers,
or AmazonProvidedDNS. To specify multiple domain name servers in a single parameter,
separate the IP addresses using commas. To have your instances receive custom DNS
hostnames as specified in `domain-name`, you must specify a custom DNS
server.

- `ntp-servers` \- The IP addresses of up to eight Network Time Protocol (NTP)
servers (four IPv4 addresses and four IPv6 addresses).

- `netbios-name-servers` \- The IP addresses of up to four NetBIOS name
servers.

- `netbios-node-type` \- The NetBIOS node type (1, 2, 4, or 8). We recommend that
you specify 2. Broadcast and multicast are not supported. For more information about
NetBIOS node types, see [RFC 2132](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2132.txt).

- `ipv6-address-preferred-lease-time` \- A value (in seconds, minutes, hours, or years) for how frequently a running instance with an IPv6 assigned to it goes through DHCPv6 lease renewal.
Acceptable values are between 140 and 2147483647 seconds (approximately 68 years). If no value is entered, the default lease time is 140 seconds. If you use long-term addressing for EC2 instances, you can increase the lease time and avoid frequent
lease renewal requests. Lease renewal typically occurs when half of the lease time has elapsed.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**DhcpConfiguration.N**

A DHCP configuration option.

Type: Array of [NewDhcpConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_NewDhcpConfiguration.html) objects

Required: Yes

**DryRun**

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request,
and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`.
Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**TagSpecification.N**

The tags to assign to the DHCP option.

Type: Array of [TagSpecification](api-tagspecification.md) objects

Required: No

## Response Elements

The following elements are returned by the service.

**dhcpOptions**

A set of DHCP options.

Type: [DhcpOptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DhcpOptions.html) object

**requestId**

The ID of the request.

Type: String

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common client error codes](errors-overview.md#CommonErrors).

## Examples

### Example

This example creates a set of DHCP options with a domain name
`example.com` and two DNS servers ( `10.2.5.1` and
`10.2.5.2`). The DNS servers' IP addresses are specified in a single
parameter, separated by commas, to preserve the order in which they are
specified.

#### Sample Request

```

https://ec2.amazonaws.com/?Action=CreateDhcpOptions
&DhcpConfiguration.1.Key=domain-name
&DhcpConfiguration.1.Value.1=example.com
&DhcpConfiguration.2.Key=domain-name-servers
&DhcpConfiguration.2.Value.1=10.2.5.1,10.2.5.2
&DhcpConfiguration.3.Key=ipv6-address-preferred-lease-time
&DhcpConfiguration.3.Value.1=140
&AUTHPARAMS
```

#### Sample Response

```
