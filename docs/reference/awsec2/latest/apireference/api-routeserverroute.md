**routeStatus**

The current status of the route in the routing database. Values are `in-rib` or `in-fib` depending on if the routes are in the RIB or the FIB database.

The [Routing Information Base (RIB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table) serves as a database that stores all the routing information and network topology data collected by a router or routing system, such as routes learned from BGP peers. The RIB is constantly updated as new routing information is received or existing routes change. This ensures that the route server always has the most current view of the network topology and can make optimal routing decisions.

The [Forwarding Information Base (FIB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forwarding_information_base) serves as a forwarding table for what route server has determined are the best-path routes in the RIB after evaluating all available routing information and policies. The FIB routes are installed on the route tables. The FIB is recomputed whenever there are changes to the RIB.

Type: String

Valid Values: `in-rib | in-fib`

Required: No
