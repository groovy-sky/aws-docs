Type: String

Required: No

**availabilityZoneId**

The AZ ID of the subnet.

Required: No

**availableIpAddressCount**

The number of unused private IPv4 addresses in the subnet. The IPv4 addresses for any
stopped instances are considered unavailable.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**blockPublicAccessStates**

**customerOwnedIpv4Pool**

The customer-owned IPv4 address pool associated with the subnet.

Type: String

Required: No

**defaultForAz**

Indicates whether this is the default subnet for the Availability Zone.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**enableDns64**

Indicates whether DNS queries made to the Amazon-provided DNS Resolver in this subnet
should return synthetic IPv6 addresses for IPv4-only destinations.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**enableLniAtDeviceIndex**

Indicates the device position for local network interfaces in this subnet. For example,
`1` indicates local network interfaces in this subnet are the secondary
network interface (eth1).

Type: Integer

Required: No

**Ipv6CidrBlockAssociationSet.N**

Information about the IPv6 CIDR blocks associated with the subnet.

Type: Array of [SubnetIpv6CidrBlockAssociation](api-subnetipv6cidrblockassociation.md) objects

Required: No

**ipv6Native**

Indicates whether this is an IPv6 only subnet.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**mapCustomerOwnedIpOnLaunch**

Indicates whether a network interface created in this subnet (including a network
interface created by [RunInstances](api-runinstances.md)) receives a customer-owned IPv4 address.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**mapPublicIpOnLaunch**

Indicates whether instances launched in this subnet receive a public IPv4 address.

AWS charges for all public IPv4 addresses, including public IPv4 addresses
associated with running instances and Elastic IP addresses. For more information, see the _Public IPv4 Address_ tab on the [Amazon VPC pricing page](http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing).

Type: String

Required: No

**ownerId**

The ID of the AWS account that owns the subnet.

Type: String

Required: No

**privateDnsNameOptionsOnLaunch**

is based on the IPv4 address or ID of the instance.

Type: [PrivateDnsNameOptionsOnLaunch](api-privatednsnameoptionsonlaunch.md) object

Required: No

**state**

The current state of the subnet.

- `failed`: The underlying infrastructure to support the subnet failed to provision
as expected.

- `failed-insufficient-capacity`: The underlying infrastructure to support the subnet
failed to provision due to a shortage of EC2 instance capacity.

Type: String

Valid Values: `pending | available | unavailable | failed | failed-insufficient-capacity`

Required: No

**subnetArn**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the subnet.

Type: String

Required: No

**subnetId**

The ID of the subnet.

Type: String

Required: No

**TagSet.N**

Any tags assigned to the subnet.

Type: Array of [Tag](api-tag.md) objects

Required: No

**type**

Indicates if this is a subnet used with Amazon Elastic VMware Service (EVS).
Possible values are `Elastic VMware Service` or no value. For more
information about Amazon EVS, see [_Amazon Elastic VMware Service_\
_API Reference_](../../../evs/latest/apireference/welcome.md).

Type: String

Required: No

**vpcId**

The ID of the VPC the subnet is in.

Type: String

Required: No
