# Filter
<a name="API_Filter"></a>

A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an `AND`, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation. For example:
+  [DescribeAvailabilityZones](API_DescribeAvailabilityZones.md)
+  [DescribeImages](API_DescribeImages.md)
+  [DescribeInstances](API_DescribeInstances.md)
+  [DescribeKeyPairs](API_DescribeKeyPairs.md)
+  [DescribeSecurityGroups](API_DescribeSecurityGroups.md)
+  [DescribeSnapshots](API_DescribeSnapshots.md)
+  [DescribeSubnets](API_DescribeSubnets.md)
+  [DescribeTags](API_DescribeTags.md)
+  [DescribeVolumes](API_DescribeVolumes.md)
+  [DescribeVpcs](API_DescribeVpcs.md)
