# Error codes for the Amazon EC2 API

Amazon EC2 has two types of error codes:

- **Client errors**. These errors are usually caused by
something the client did, such as specifying an incorrect or invalid parameter in
the request, or using an action or resource on behalf of a user that doesn't have
permission to use the action or resource. These errors are accompanied by a
400-series HTTP response code.

- **Server errors**. These errors are usually caused by an AWS
server-side issue. These errors are accompanied by a 500-series HTTP response
code.

## Common client error codes

This section lists the client error codes that all Amazon EC2 API actions can return.

Error codeDescription`AuthFailure`The provided credentials could not be validated. You might not be
authorized to carry out the request; for example, trying to associate
an Elastic IP address that is not yours, or trying to use an AMI for
which you do not have permissions. Ensure that your account is authorized
to use Amazon EC2, that your credit card details are correct, and that you
are using the correct credentials.`Blocked`Your account is currently blocked. Contact
[Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us)
if you have questions.`DryRunOperation`The user has the required permissions, so the request would have
succeeded, but the `DryRun` parameter was used.`IdempotentParameterMismatch`The request uses the same client token as a previous, but
non-identical request. Do not reuse a client token with different
requests, unless the requests are identical.`IncompleteSignature`The request signature does not conform to AWS standards.`InvalidAction`The action or operation requested is not valid. Verify that the action
is typed correctly.`InvalidCharacter`A specified character is invalid.`InvalidClientTokenId`The X.509 certificate or credentials provided do not exist in
our records.`InvalidPaginationToken`The specified pagination token is not valid or is expired.`InvalidParameter`A parameter specified in a request is not valid, is unsupported, or
cannot be used. The returned message provides an explanation of the
error value. For example, if you are launching an instance, you can't
specify a security group and subnet that are in different VPCs.`InvalidParameterCombination`Indicates an incorrect combination of parameters, or a missing
parameter. For example, trying to terminate an instance without
specifying the instance ID.`InvalidParameterDependency`Indicates an incorrect combination of parameters, or a missing
parameter. For example, trying to terminate an instance without
specifying the instance ID.`InvalidParameterValue`A value specified in a parameter is not valid, is unsupported, or
cannot be used. Ensure that you specify a resource by using its full ID.
The returned message provides an explanation of the error value.`InvalidQueryParameter`The AWS query string is malformed or does not adhere to AWS
standards.`MalformedQueryString`The query string contains a syntax error.`MissingAction`The request is missing an action or a required parameter.`MissingAuthenticationToken`The request must contain valid credentials.`MissingParameter`The request is missing a required parameter. Ensure that you have
supplied all the required parameters for the request; for example, the
resource ID.`OptInRequired`You are not authorized to use the requested service. Ensure that you
have subscribed to the service you are trying to use. If you are new to
AWS, your account might take some time to be activated while your credit
card details are being verified.`PendingVerification`Your account is pending verification. Until the verification process
is complete, you may not be able to carry out requests with this
account. If you have questions, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us).
`RequestExpired`The request reached the service more than 15 minutes after the date stamp on the
request or more than 15 minutes after the request expiration date (such
as for presigned URLs), or the date stamp on the request is more than 15
minutes in the future. If you're using temporary security credentials,
this error can also occur if the credentials have expired. For more
information, see [Temporary security credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.`TagPolicyViolation`You attempted to create or update a resource with tags that are not
compliant with the tag policy requirements for this account. For more
information, see [Grant permission to tag resources during creation.](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/supported-iam-actions-tagging.md)`UnauthorizedOperation`You are not authorized to perform this operation. Check your IAM
policies, and ensure that you are using the correct credentials. For
more information, see [Identity and access management for Amazon EC2](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/security-iam.md). If the returned message is encoded, you
can decode it using the `DecodeAuthorizationMessage` action.
For more information, see [DecodeAuthorizationMessage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_DecodeAuthorizationMessage.html) in the
_AWS Security Token Service API Reference_.`UnknownParameter`An unknown or unrecognized parameter was supplied. Requests that
could cause this error include supplying a misspelled parameter or a
parameter that is not supported for the specified API version.`UnsupportedInstanceAttribute`The specified attribute cannot be modified.`UnsupportedOperation`The specified request includes an unsupported operation. For example,
you can't stop an instance that's instance store-backed. Or you might be
trying to launch an instance type that is not supported by the specified
AMI. The returned message provides details of the unsupported
operation.`UnsupportedProtocol`SOAP has been deprecated and is no longer supported.`ValidationError`The input fails to satisfy the constraints specified by an AWS
service.

## Client error codes for specific actions

This section lists client errors that are specific to certain Amazon EC2 API actions.

Error codeDescription`AccountDisabled`The functionality you have requested has been administratively
disabled for this account.`ActiveVpcPeeringConnectionPerVpcLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of active VPC peering
connections you can have for the specified VPC.`AddressLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of Elastic IP addresses that

`AsnConflict`The Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) of the specified customer
gateway and the specified virtual private gateway are the same.`AttachmentLimitExceeded`

You've reached the limit on the number of Amazon EBS volumes or network
interfaces that can be attached to a single instance.

The number of Amazon EBS volumes that you can attach to an instance depends on
the instance type. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volume limits \
for Amazon EC2 instances](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/volume-limits.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

`BootForVolumeTypeUnsupported`The specified volume type cannot be used as a boot volume. For more
information, see [Amazon EBS volume types](../../../../services/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volume-types.md).`BundlingInProgress`The specified instance already has a bundling task in progress.
`CannotDelete`You cannot delete the 'default' security group in your VPC, but you
can change its rules. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 security\
groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html).`CapacityBlockDescribeLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit for this account. The returned message provides details.`ClientInvalidParameterValue`A parameter specified in a request is not valid, is unsupported, or
cannot be used. The returned message provides an explanation of the
error value. For example, if you are launching an instance, you can't
specify a security group and subnet that are in different VPCs.`ClientVpnAuthorizationRuleLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of authorization rules that can be added to a single Client VPN endpoint.`ClientVpnCertificateRevocationListLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of client certificate revocation lists that can be added to a single Client VPN endpoint.`ClientVpnEndpointAssociationExists`The specified target network is already associated with the Client VPN endpoint.`ClientVpnEndpointLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of Client VPN endpoints that you can create.`ClientVpnRouteLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of routes that can be added to a single Client VPN endpoint.`ClientVpnTerminateConnectionsLimitExceeded`The number of client connections you're attempting to terminate exceeds the limit.`ConcurrentCreateImageNoRebootLimitExceeded`

The maximum number of concurrent CreateImage requests for the
instance has been reached. Wait for the current CreateImage requests
to complete, and then retry your request.

`ConcurrentSnapshotLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of concurrent snapshots you can create on the
specified volume. Wait until the 'pending' requests have completed, and
check that you do not have snapshots that are in an incomplete state,
such as 'error', which count against your concurrent snapshot
limit.`ConcurrentTagAccess`You can't run simultaneous commands to modify a tag for a specific
resource. Allow sufficient wait time for the previous request to
complete, then retry your request.`CreditSpecificationUpdateInProgress`The default credit specification for the instance family is currently being updated. It
takes about five minutes to complete. For more information, see [Set the default credit specification for the account](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/burstable-performance-instances-how-to.md#burstable-performance-instance-set-default-credit-specification-for-account).`CustomerGatewayLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of customer gateways you can create for the AWS
Region. For more information, see [Amazon VPC quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html).`CustomerKeyHasBeenRevoked`The KMS key cannot be accessed. For more information, see [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption.html).`DeclarativePoliciesAccessDeniedException`You do not have sufficient access to perform this action, or the specified
`TargetId` does not exist, or the specified
`TargetId` is not in your organization. To generate an
account status report for declarative policies, the caller must be the
management account or a delegated administrator for the organization and
the specified `TargetId` must belong to your
organization.`DeclarativePoliciesNotEnabledException`Trusted access is not enabled. Trusted access must be enabled for the service for which
the declarative policy will enforce a baseline configuration. The API
uses the following service principal to identify the EC2 service:
`ec2.amazonaws.com`. For more information on how to
enable trusted access with the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs, see [Using Organizations with other AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html).`DeleteConversionTaskError`The conversion task cannot be canceled. `DefaultSubnetAlreadyExistsInAvailabilityZone`A default subnet already exists in the specified Availability Zone.
You can have only one default subnet per Availability Zone.`DefaultVpcAlreadyExists`A default VPC already exists in the AWS Region. You can only have one default VPC per
Region.`DefaultVpcDoesNotExist`There is no default VPC in which to carry out the request. If you've
deleted your default VPC, you can create a new one. For more
information, see [Create a default VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html#create-default-vpc).`DependencyViolation`The specified object has dependent resources. A number of resources
in a VPC may have dependent resources, which prevent you from deleting
or detaching them. Remove the dependencies first, then retry your
request. For example, this error occurs if you try to delete a security
group in a VPC that is in use by another security group.`DiskImageSizeTooLarge`The disk image exceeds the allowed limit (for instance or volume
import).`DuplicateSubnetsInSameZone`For an interface VPC endpoint, you can specify only one subnet per
Availability Zone.`EncryptedVolumesNotSupported`Encrypted Amazon EBS volumes may only be attached to instances that
support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption.html).`ExistingVpcEndpointConnections`You cannot delete a VPC endpoint service configuration or change the
load balancers for the endpoint service if there are endpoints attached
to the service.`FleetNotInModifiableState`The Spot Fleet request must be in the `active` state in order to modify it.
For more information, see [Spot Fleet request types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html).`FlowLogAlreadyExists`A flow log with the specified configuration already exists.`FlowLogsLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of flow logs you can create.
For more information, see [Amazon VPC quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html).`FilterLimitExceeded`The request uses too many filters or too many filter
values.`Gateway.NotAttached`An internet gateway is not attached to a VPC. If you are trying to detach an internet
gateway, ensure that you specify the correct VPC. If you are trying to
associate an Elastic IP address with a network interface or an instance,
ensure that an internet gateway is attached to the relevant VPC.`HostAlreadyCoveredByReservation`The specified Dedicated Host is already covered by a
reservation.`HostLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of Dedicated Hosts that you
can allocate. For more information, see [Dedicated Hosts](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/dedicated-hosts-overview.md).`IdempotentInstanceTerminated`The request to launch an instance uses the same client token as a
previous request for which the instance has been terminated.`InaccessibleStorageLocation`The specified Amazon S3 URL cannot be accessed. Check the access
permissions for the URL.`InaccessibleStorageLocationException`The specified Amazon S3 bucket can't be accessed. An S3 bucket must be available before
generating an account status report for declarative policies (you can
create a new one or use an existing one), you must own the bucket, it
must be in the same Region in which the request was made, and it must
have an appropriate bucket policy. For a sample S3 policy, see _Sample Amazon S3 policy_ under [Examples](api-startdeclarativepoliciesreport.md#API_StartDeclarativePoliciesReport_Examples).`IncorrectInstanceState`The instance is in an incorrect state for the requested action. For example,
some instance attributes, such as user data,
can only be modified if the instance is in a 'stopped' state.

If
you are associating an Elastic IP address with a network interface,
ensure that the instance that the interface is attached to is not in
the 'pending' state.

`IncorrectModificationState`A new modification action on an EBS Elastic Volume cannot occur
because the volume is currently being modified.`IncorrectSpotRequestState`The Spot Instance request is in an incorrect state for the request.
Spot request status information can help you track your Amazon EC2 Spot
Instance requests. For more information, see [Spot request\
status](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/spot-request-status.md).`IncorrectState`The resource is in an incorrect state for the request. This error can occur if you are
trying to attach a volume that is still being created or detach a volume
that is not in the 'available' state. Verify that the volume is in the
'available' state. If you are creating a snapshot, ensure that the
previous request to create a snapshot on the same volume has completed.
If you are deleting a virtual private gateway, ensure that it's detached
from the VPC.`IncorrectStateException`

The resource is in an incorrect state for the request. This error
can occur if you're trying to cancel the generation of an account
status report for declarative policies that already has the
`complete`, `cancelled`, or
`error` status. Cancelation is only possible for
reports with a `running` status. This error can also
occur when you're trying to get a summary for a report that has not
yet reached the `completed` status. This error can also
occur if you start report generation while another report is being
generated. Only one report per organization can be generated at a
time. For more information, see [Generating the account status report for declarative\
policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_declarative_status-report.html).

`IncompatibleHostRequirements`There are no available or compatible Dedicated Hosts available on which to launch or
start the instance.`InstanceCreditSpecification.NotSupported`The specified instance does not use CPU credits for CPU usage; only T2 instances use
CPU credits for CPU usage.`InstanceEventStartTimeCannotChange`The specified scheduled event start time does not meet the
requirements for rescheduling a scheduled event. For more information,
see [Limitations](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/monitoring-instances-status-check-sched.md).`InstanceLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of instances you can run concurrently. This
error can occur if you are launching an instance or if you are creating
a Capacity Reservation. Capacity Reservations count towards your
On-Demand Instance limits. If your request fails due to limit
constraints, increase your On-Demand Instance limit for the required
instance type and try again. For more information, see [EC2 On-Demand instance limits](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs).`InsufficientCapacityOnHost`There is not enough capacity on the Dedicated Host to launch or start
the instance.`InstanceTpmEkPubNotFound`The public Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Endorsement Key (EK) cannot
be found.`InsufficientFreeAddressesInSubnet`The specified subnet does not contain enough free private IP addresses to
fulfill your request. Use the [DescribeSubnets](api-describesubnets.md) request to view how many IP addresses are
available (unused) in your subnet. IP addresses associated with stopped
instances are considered unavailable.`InsufficientReservedInstancesCapacity`There is insufficient capacity for the requested Reserved Instances. `InterfaceInUseByTrafficMirrorSession`The Traffic Mirror source that you are trying to create uses an interface that is
already associated with a session. An interface can only be associated
with a session, or with a target, but not both.`InterfaceInUseByTrafficMirrorTarget`The Traffic Mirror source that you are trying to create uses an interface that is
already associated with a target. An interface can only be associated
with a session, or with a target, but not both. If the interface is
associated with a target, it cannot be associated with another
target.`InternetGatewayLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of internet gateways that you can create. For
more information, see [Amazon VPC quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html).`InvalidAddress.Locked`The specified Elastic IP address cannot be released from your account. A reverse DNS
record may be associated with the Elastic IP address. To unlock the
address, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us).`InvalidAddress.Malformed`The specified IP address is not valid. Ensure that you provide the

located, if it's not in the default Region.`InvalidAMIAttributeItemValue`The value of an item added to, or removed from, an image attribute is
not valid. If you are specifying a `userId`, check that it is
in the form of an AWS account ID, without hyphens.`InvalidAMIID.Malformed`The specified AMI ID is malformed. Ensure that you provide the full
AMI ID, in the form ami- _xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_.`InvalidAMIID.NotFound`The specified AMI doesn't exist. Check the AMI ID, and ensure that you specify the
AWS Region in which the AMI is located, if it's not in the default
Region. This error might also occur if you specified an incorrect kernel
ID when launching an instance. This error might also occur if the AMI
doesn't meet your Allowed AMIs criteria. To use this AMI, you must
change the Allowed AMIs criteria. For more information, see [Control the\
discovery and use of AMIs in Amazon EC2 with Allowed\
AMIs](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-allowed-amis.md).`InvalidAMIID.Unavailable`The specified AMI has been deregistered and is no longer available,
or is not in a state from which you can launch an instance or modify attributes.`InvalidAMIName.Duplicate`The specified AMI name is already in use by another AMI. If you have
recently deregistered an AMI with the same name, allow enough time for
the change to propagate through the system, and retry your

another security group. You can remove dependencies by modifying or
deleting rules in the affected security groups.`InvalidGroup.NotFound`

The specified security group does not exist.

This error can occur because the ID of a recently created security
group has not propagated through the system. For more information,
see [Ensuring idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html).

You can't specify a security group that is in a different AWS Region or VPC than the
request.

`InvalidGroup.Reserved`The name 'default' is reserved, and cannot be used to create a new
security group.`InvalidHostConfiguration`The specified Dedicated Host configuration is not supported.`InvalidHostId`The specified Dedicated Host ID is not valid.`InvalidHostID.Malformed`The specified Dedicated Host ID is not formed correctly. Ensure that

information about valid ARN formats, see [Amazon Resource\
Names (ARNs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html).`InvalidID`The specified ID for the resource you are trying to tag is not valid.
Ensure that you provide the full resource ID; for example,
ami-2bb65342 for an AMI.

If you're using the command line tools
on a Windows system, you might need to use quotation marks for the
key-value pair; for example,
`"Name=TestTag"`.

`InvalidInput`An input parameter in the request is not valid. For example, you may have specified an
incorrect Reserved Instance listing ID in the request or the Reserved
Instance you tried to list cannot be sold in the Reserved Instances
Marketplace (for example, if it has a scope of Region, or is a
Convertible Reserved Instance).`InvalidInstanceAttributeValue`The specified instance attribute value is not valid. This error is
most commonly encountered when trying to set the
`InstanceType`/ `--instance-type` attribute to
an unrecognized value.`InvalidInstanceConnectEndpointId.Malformed`The specified EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint ID is malformed. Ensure that you
specify the ID in the form eice- _xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_.`InvalidInstanceConnectEndpointId.NotFound`The specified EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint does not exist.`InvalidInstanceCreditSpecification`If you are modifying the credit option for CPU usage for T2 instances, the request may
not contain duplicate instance IDs.`InvalidInstanceCreditSpecification.DuplicateInstanceId`If you are modifying the credit option for CPU usage for T2 instances, the request may
not contain duplicate instance IDs.`InvalidInstanceEventIDNotFound`The specified ID of the event whose date and time you are modifying
cannot be found. Verify the ID of the event and try your request again.
`InvalidInstanceEventStartTime`The specified scheduled event start time does not meet the
requirements for rescheduling a scheduled event. For more information,
see [Limitations](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/monitoring-instances-status-check-sched.md).`InvalidInstanceFamily`The instance family is not supported for this request. For example, the instance family
for the Dedicated Host Reservation offering is different from the
instance family of the Dedicated Hosts. Or, you can only modify the
default credit specification for burstable performance instance families
(T2, T3, and T3a). For more information, see [Set the default credit specification for the account](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/burstable-performance-instances-how-to.md#burstable-performance-instance-set-default-credit-specification-for-account).`InvalidInstanceID`

This error can
occur when trying to perform an operation on an instance that has multiple
network interfaces.

A network interface can have individual attributes;
therefore, you may need to specify the network interface ID as part
of the request, or use a different request. For example, each
network interface in an instance can have a source/destination check
flag. To modify this attribute, modify the network interface
attribute, and not the instance attribute.

To create a

Details in your Spot request exceed the numbers allowed by the
Spot service in one of the following ways, depending on the action
that generated the error:

—If you get this error when you submitted a request for Spot Instances, check
the number of Spot Instances specified in your request. The number
shouldn't exceed the 3,000 maximum allowed per request. Resend your
Spot Instance request and specify a number less than 3,000. If your
account's regional Spot request limit is greater than 3,000
instances, you can access these instances by submitting multiple
smaller requests.

—If you get this error when you sent Describe Spot Instance requests, check the
number of requests for Spot Instance data, the amount of data you
requested, and how often you sent the request. The frequency with
which you requested the data combined with the amount of data
exceeds the levels allowed by the Spot service. Try again and submit

The specified Availability Zone does not support Provisioned IOPS SSD
volumes. Try launching your instance in a different Availability
Zone, or don't specify a zone in the request. If you're creating a
volume, try specifying a different Availability Zone in the
request.

`VPCIdNotSpecified`You have no default VPC in which to carry out the request. Specify a VPC or subnet ID
or, in the case of security groups, specify the ID and not the security group name.
If you deleted your default VPC, you can create a new one. For more information, see
[Create a default VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html#create-default-vpc).`VpcEndpointLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of VPC endpoints that you can create in the AWS
Region. For more information, see [Amazon VPC quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html).`VpcLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of VPCs that you can create in the AWS Region.

that you have a VPC in your account, and then specify a subnet ID or
network interface ID in the request.`VpnConnectionLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of VPN connections that you
can create. For more information, see [Amazon VPC quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html).`VpnGatewayAttachmentLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of VPCs that can be attached
to the specified virtual private gateway.`VpnGatewayLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the number of virtual private gateways that you can
create. For more information about limits, see [Amazon VPC quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html).`ZonesMismatched`The Availability Zone for the instance does not match that of the
Dedicated Host.

### Common causes of client errors

There are a number of reasons that you might encounter an error while performing a
request. Some errors can be prevented or easily solved by following these
guidelines:

- **Specify the Region**: Some resources can't be shared between AWS
Regions. If you are specifying a resource that's located in a Region other
than the current Region, specify its Region in the request. If the resource
cannot be found, you get the following error:
`Client.Invalid` _Resource_ `.NotFound`;
for example, `Client.InvalidInstanceID.NotFound`.

- **Allow for eventual consistency**: Some errors are
caused because a previous request has not yet propagated thorough the
system. For more information, see [Ensuring idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html).

- **Use a sleep interval between request rates**: Amazon EC2 API requests are
throttled to help maintain the performance of the service. If your requests
have been throttled, you get the following error:
`Client.RequestLimitExceeded`. For more information, see
[Ensuring idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html).

- **Use the full ID of the resource**: When specifying a
resource, ensure that you use its full ID, and not its user-supplied name or
description. For example, when specifying a security group in a request, use
its ID in the form sg- _xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_.

- **Check your services**: Ensure that you have signed up
for all the services you are attempting to use. You can check which services
you're signed up for by going to the **My Account** section
of the [AWS home page](https://aws.amazon.com/).

- **Check your permissions**: Ensure that you have the required
permissions to carry out the request. If you are not authorized, you get the
following error: `Client.UnauthorizedOperation`. For more
information, see [Identity and \
access management for Amazon EC2](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/security-iam.md).

- **Check your VPC**: Some resources cannot be shared
between VPCs; for example, security groups.

- **Check your credentials**: Ensure that you entered the
credentials correctly; and, if you have more than one account, that you are
using the correct credentials for the specific account. If the provided
credentials are incorrect, you might get the following error:
`Client.AuthFailure`.

## Server error codes

This section lists server error codes that can be returned.

Error codeDescription`BandwidthLimitExceeded`You've reached the limit on the network bandwidth that is available to an Amazon EC2
instance. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 instance network bandwidth](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-instance-network-bandwidth.md).`InsufficientAddressCapacity`Not enough available addresses to satisfy your minimum request.
Reduce the number of addresses you are requesting or wait for additional
capacity to become available.`InsufficientCapacity`There is not enough capacity to fulfill your import instance request.
You can wait for additional capacity to become available. `InsufficientInstanceCapacity`There is not enough capacity to fulfill your request. This error can occur if you
launch a new instance, restart a stopped instance, create a new Capacity
Reservation, or modify an existing Capacity Reservation. Reduce the
number of instances in your request, or wait for additional capacity to
become available. You can also try launching an instance by selecting
different instance types (which you can resize at a later stage). The
returned message might also give specific guidance about how to solve
the problem.`InsufficientHostCapacity`There is not enough capacity to fulfill your Dedicated Host request.
Reduce the number of Dedicated Hosts in your request, or wait for
additional capacity to become available. `InsufficientReservedInstanceCapacity`Not enough available Reserved Instances to satisfy your minimum request. Reduce the
number of Reserved Instances in your request or wait for additional
capacity to become available.`InsufficientVolumeCapacity`There is not enough capacity to fulfill your EBS volume provision
request. You can try to provision a different volume type, EBS volume in
a different availability zone, or you can wait for additional capacity
to become available. `ServerInternal`An internal error has occurred. Retry your request, but if the
problem persists, contact us with details by posting a message on
[AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/).`InternalFailure`The request processing has failed because of an unknown error, exception, or
failure.`RequestLimitExceeded`The maximum request rate permitted by the Amazon EC2 APIs has been
exceeded for your account. For best results, use an increasing or
variable sleep interval between requests. For more information, see
[Query API request rate](query-api-troubleshooting.md#api-request-rate).`ServiceUnavailable`The request has failed due to a temporary failure of the
server.`InternalError`An internal error has occurred. Retry your request, but if the
problem persists, contact us with details by posting a message on
[AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/).`Unavailable`The server is overloaded and can't handle the request.

## Example error response

The following shows the structure of a request error response.

```

<Response>
    <Errors>
         <Error>
           <Code>Error code text</Code>
           <Message>Error message</Message>
         </Error>
    </Errors>
    <RequestID>request ID</RequestID>
</Response>

```

The following shows an example of an error response.

```

<Response>
    <Errors>
         <Error>
           <Code>InvalidInstanceID.NotFound</Code>
           <Message>The instance ID 'i-1a2b3c4d' does not exist</Message>
         </Error>
    </Errors>
    <RequestID>ea966190-f9aa-478e-9ede-example</RequestID>
</Response>
```

## Eventual consistency

The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model, due to the distributed nature of
the system supporting the API. This means that when you run an API command, the result
may not be immediately visible to subsequent API commands, which can result in an error.

For more information about eventual consistency and how to manage it, see [Eventual consistency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html).
