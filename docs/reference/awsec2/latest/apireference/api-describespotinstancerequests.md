# DescribeSpotInstanceRequests

Describes the specified Spot Instance requests.

You can use `DescribeSpotInstanceRequests` to find a running Spot Instance by
examining the response. If the status of the Spot Instance is `fulfilled`, the
instance ID appears in the response and contains the identifier of the instance.
Alternatively, you can use [DescribeInstances](api-describeinstances.md)
with a filter to look for instances where the instance lifecycle is
`spot`.

We recommend that you set `MaxResults` to a value between 5 and 1000 to
limit the number of items returned. This paginates the output, which makes the list
more manageable and returns the items faster. If the list of items exceeds your
`MaxResults` value, then that number of items is returned along with a
`NextToken` value that can be passed to a subsequent
`DescribeSpotInstanceRequests` request to retrieve the remaining
items.

Spot Instance requests are deleted four hours after they are canceled and their instances are
terminated.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**DryRun**

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually
making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required
permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is
`UnauthorizedOperation`.
