# UnassignPrivateNatGatewayAddress

Unassigns secondary private IPv4 addresses from a private NAT gateway. You cannot unassign your primary private IP. For more information,
see [Edit secondary IP address associations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/nat-gateway-working-with.html#nat-gateway-edit-secondary)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

While unassigning is in progress, you cannot assign/unassign additional IP addresses while the connections are being drained. You are, however, allowed to delete the NAT gateway.

A private IP address will only be released at the end of MaxDrainDurationSeconds. The
private IP addresses stay associated and support the existing connections, but do not
support any new connections (new connections are distributed across the remaining
assigned private IP address). After the existing connections drain out, the private IP
addresses are released.

## Request Parameters

Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**MaxDrainDurationSeconds**

The maximum amount of time to wait (in seconds) before forcibly releasing the IP addresses if connections are still in progress. Default value is 350 seconds.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 4000.

Required: No

**NatGatewayId**

The ID of the NAT gateway.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**PrivateIpAddress.N**

The private IPv4 addresses you want to unassign.

Type: Array of strings

Required: Yes

## Response Elements
