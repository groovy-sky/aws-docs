# DescribeAddressTransfers
<a name="API_DescribeAddressTransfers"></a>

Describes an Elastic IP address transfer. For more information, see [Transfer Elastic IP addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-eips.html#transfer-EIPs-intro) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

When you transfer an Elastic IP address, there is a two-step handshake between the source and transfer AWS accounts. When the source account starts the transfer, the transfer account has seven days to accept the Elastic IP address transfer. During those seven days, the source account can view the pending transfer by using this action. After seven days, the transfer expires and ownership of the Elastic IP address returns to the source account. Accepted transfers are visible to the source account for 14 days after the transfers have been accepted.
