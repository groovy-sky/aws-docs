# DescribeCapacityReservations

Describes one or more of your Capacity Reservations. The results describe only the
Capacity Reservations in the AWS Region that you're currently
using.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**CapacityReservationId.N**

The ID of the Capacity Reservation.

Type: Array of strings

Required: No

**DryRun**

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**Filter.N**

One or more filters.

- `instance-type` \- The type of instance for which the Capacity
Reservation reserves capacity.

- `owner-id` \- The ID of the AWS account that owns the
Capacity Reservation.

- `instance-platform` \- The type of operating system for which the
Capacity Reservation reserves capacity.

- `availability-zone` \- The Availability Zone of the Capacity
Reservation.

- `tenancy` \- Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. A
Capacity Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:

- `default` \- The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware
that is shared with other AWS accounts.

- `dedicated` \- The Capacity Reservation is created on
single-tenant hardware that is dedicated to a single AWS account.

- `outpost-arn` \- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost on
which the Capacity Reservation was created.

- `state` \- The current state of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity
Reservation can be in one of the following states:

- `active`\- The Capacity Reservation is active and the
capacity is available for your use.

- `expired` \- The Capacity Reservation expired automatically
at the date and time specified in your request. The reserved capacity is
no longer available for your use.

- `cancelled` \- The Capacity Reservation was cancelled. The
reserved capacity is no longer available for your use.

- `pending` \- The Capacity Reservation request was successful
but the capacity provisioning is still pending.

- `failed` \- The Capacity Reservation request has failed. A
request might fail due to invalid request parameters, capacity
constraints, or instance limit constraints. Failed requests are retained
for 60 minutes.

- `start-date` \- The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation
was started.

- `end-date` \- The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation
expires. When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released
and you can no longer launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation's state
changes to expired when it reaches its end date and time.

- `end-date-type` \- Indicates the way in which the Capacity
Reservation ends. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following end
types:

- `unlimited` \- The Capacity Reservation remains active until
you explicitly cancel it.

- `limited` \- The Capacity Reservation expires automatically
at a specified date and time.

- `instance-match-criteria` \- Indicates the type of instance launches
that the Capacity Reservation accepts. The options include:

- `open` \- The Capacity Reservation accepts all instances
that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability
Zone). Instances that have matching attributes launch into the Capacity
Reservation automatically without specifying any additional
parameters.

- `targeted` \- The Capacity Reservation only accepts
instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and
Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This
ensures that only permitted instances can use the reserved
capacity.

- `placement-group-arn` \- The ARN of the cluster placement group in
which the Capacity Reservation was created.
