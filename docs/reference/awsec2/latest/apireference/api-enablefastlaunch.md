# EnableFastLaunch
<a name="API_EnableFastLaunch"></a>

When you enable Windows fast launch for a Windows AMI, images are pre-provisioned, using snapshots to launch instances up to 65% faster. To create the optimized Windows image, Amazon EC2 launches an instance and runs through Sysprep steps, rebooting as required. Then it creates a set of reserved snapshots that are used for subsequent launches. The reserved snapshots are automatically replenished as they are used, depending on your settings for launch frequency.

**Note**
You can only change these settings for Windows AMIs that you own or that have been shared with you.

## Request Parameters
<a name="API_EnableFastLaunch_RequestParameters"></a>

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](CommonParameters.md).

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.
Type: Boolean
Required: No

 **ImageId**
Specify the ID of the image for which to enable Windows fast launch.
Type: String
Required: Yes

 **LaunchTemplate**
The launch template to use when launching Windows instances from pre-provisioned snapshots. Launch template parameters can include either the name or ID of the launch template, but not both.
Type: [FastLaunchLaunchTemplateSpecificationRequest](API_FastLaunchLaunchTemplateSpecificationRequest.md) object
Required: No

 **MaxParallelLaunches**
The maximum number of instances that Amazon EC2 can launch at the same time to create pre-provisioned snapshots for Windows fast launch. Value must be `6` or greater.
Type: Integer
Required: No

 **ResourceType**
The type of resource to use for pre-provisioning the AMI for Windows fast launch. Supported values include: `snapshot`, which is the default value.
Type: String
Required: No

 **SnapshotConfiguration**
Configuration settings for creating and managing the snapshots that are used for pre-provisioning the AMI for Windows fast launch. The associated `ResourceType` must be `snapshot`.
Type: [FastLaunchSnapshotConfigurationRequest](API_FastLaunchSnapshotConfigurationRequest.md) object
Required: No

Type: String

 **requestId**
The ID of the request.
Type: String

 **resourceType**
The type of resource that was defined for pre-provisioning the AMI for Windows fast launch.
Type: String
Valid Values: `snapshot`

 **snapshotConfiguration**
Settings to create and manage the pre-provisioned snapshots that Amazon EC2 uses for faster launches from the Windows AMI. This property is returned when the associated `resourceType` is `snapshot`.

 **state**
The current state of Windows fast launch for the specified AMI.
Type: String
Valid Values: `enabling | enabling-failed | enabled | enabled-failed | disabling | disabling-failed`

 **stateTransitionReason**
The reason that the state changed for Windows fast launch for the AMI.
Type: String
