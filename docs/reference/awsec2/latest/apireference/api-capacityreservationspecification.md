# CapacityReservationSpecification

Describes an instance's Capacity Reservation targeting option.

Use the `CapacityReservationPreference` parameter to configure the instance
to run as an On-Demand Instance, to run in any `open` Capacity Reservation
that has matching attributes, or to run only in a Capacity Reservation or Capacity
Reservation group. Use the `CapacityReservationTarget` parameter to
explicitly target a specific Capacity Reservation or a Capacity Reservation
group.

You can only specify `CapacityReservationPreference` and
`CapacityReservationTarget` if the
`CapacityReservationPreference` is
`capacity-reservations-only`.

## Contents

Reservation that has matching attributes (instance type, platform, Availability

On-Demand Instance.
