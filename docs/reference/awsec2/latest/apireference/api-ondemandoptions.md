 ** allocationStrategy **
The strategy that determines the order of the launch template overrides to use in fulfilling On-Demand capacity.
 `lowest-price` - EC2 Fleet uses price to determine the order, launching the lowest price first.
 `prioritized` - EC2 Fleet uses the priority that you assigned to each launch template override, launching the highest priority first.
Default: `lowest-price`
Type: String
Valid Values: `lowest-price | prioritized`
Required: No

 ** capacityReservationOptions **
The strategy for using unused Capacity Reservations for fulfilling On-Demand capacity.
Supported only for fleets of type `instant`.
Type: [CapacityReservationOptions](API_CapacityReservationOptions.md) object
Required: No

 ** maxTotalPrice **
The maximum amount per hour for On-Demand Instances that you're willing to pay.
If your fleet includes T instances that are configured as `unlimited`, and if their average CPU usage exceeds the baseline utilization, you will incur a charge for surplus credits. The `maxTotalPrice` does not account for surplus credits, and, if you use surplus credits, your final cost might be higher than what you specified for `maxTotalPrice`. For more information, see [Surplus credits can incur charges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances-unlimited-mode-concepts.html#unlimited-mode-surplus-credits) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

Constraints: Maximum value of `1000`. Supported only for fleets of type `instant`.
At least one of the following must be specified: `SingleAvailabilityZone` \| `SingleInstanceType`
Type: Integer
Required: No

 ** singleAvailabilityZone **
Indicates that the fleet launches all On-Demand Instances into a single Availability Zone.
Supported only for fleets of type `instant`.
Type: Boolean
Required: No

 ** singleInstanceType **
