# Query requests for Amazon EC2

Query requests are HTTP or HTTPS requests that use the HTTP verb GET or POST and a
Query parameter named `Action`. For each Amazon EC2 API action, you can choose whether to use GET or POST.
Regardless of which verb you choose, the same data is sent and received. For a list of Amazon EC2 API actions,
see [Actions](query-apis.md).

## Structure of a GET request

The Amazon EC2 documentation presents the GET requests as URLs, which can be used
directly in a browser.

###### Note

Because the GET requests are URLs, you must URL encode the parameter
values. In the Amazon EC2 documentation, we leave the example GET requests unencoded
to make them easier to read.

The request consists of the following:

- **Endpoint**: The URL that serves as the entry point for the web
service. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 service endpoints](../../../../services/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-endpoints.md).

- **Action**: The action that you want to perform; for
example, use `RunInstances` to launch an instance.

- **Parameters**: Any parameters for the action; each
parameter is separated by an ampersand (&).

- **Version**: The API version to use. For the Amazon EC2 API,
the version is 2016-11-15.

- **Authorization parameters**: The authorization parameters that
AWS uses to ensure the validity and authenticity of the request. Amazon EC2 supports Signature Version 2
and Signature Version 4. We recommend that you use Signature Version 4. For more information,
see [Signing AWS API requests](../../../../services/iam/latest/userguide/reference-aws-signing.md) in
the _IAM User Guide_.

The following optional parameters can be included in your request:

- **DryRun**: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request. If you have the required permissions, the request returns
`DryRunOperation`; otherwise, it returns
`UnauthorizedOperation`.

- **SecurityToken**: The temporary security token obtained through a call to
AWS Security Token Service.

For more information about common parameters for API requests, see [Common query parameters](commonparameters.md).

The following is an example request that launches instances:

```nohighlight

https://ec2.amazonaws.com/?Action=RunInstances&ImageId=ami-2bb65342&MaxCount=3&MinCount=1&Placement.AvailabilityZone=us-east-1a&Monitoring.Enabled=true&Version=2016-11-15&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIDEXAMPLE%2F20130813%2Fus-east-1%2Fec2%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20130813T150206Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=content-type%3Bhost%3Bx-amz-date&X-Amz-Signature=525d1a96c69b5549dd78dbbec8efe264102288b83ba87b7d58d4b76b71f59fd2
Content-type: application/json
host:ec2.amazonaws.com
```

To make these example requests even easier to read, AWS documentation may present them in
the following format:

```nohighlight

https://ec2.amazonaws.com/?Action=RunInstances
&ImageId=ami-2bb65342
&MaxCount=3
&MinCount=1
&Placement.AvailabilityZone=us-east-1a
&Monitoring.Enabled=true
&Version=2016-11-15
&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256
&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLEus-east-1%2Fec2%2Faws4_request
&X-Amz-Date=20130813T150206Z
&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=content-type%3Bhost%3Bx-amz-date
&X-Amz-Signature=ced6826de92d2bdeed8f846f0bf508e8559e98e4b0194b84example54174deb456c
Content-type: application/json
host:ec2.amazonaws.com
```

The first line specifies the endpoint of the request. After the endpoint is a
question mark (?), which separates the endpoint from the parameters. For more information
about Amazon EC2 endpoints, see [Amazon EC2 service endpoints](../../../../services/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-endpoints.md).

The `Action` parameter indicates the action to perform. For a complete list of
actions, see [Actions](query-apis.md). The
remaining lines specify additional parameters for the request.

In the example Query requests we present in the Amazon EC2 API documentation, we omit the
headers, [common required parameters](commonparameters.md), and
authentication parameters to make it easier for you to focus on the parameters for
the action. We replace them with the `&AUTHPARAMS` literal string to
remind you that you must include these parameters in your request; for
example:

```nohighlight

https://ec2.amazonaws.com/?Action=RunInstances
&ImageId=ami-2bb65342
&MaxCount=3
&MinCount=1
&Placement.AvailabilityZone=us-east-1a
&Monitoring.Enabled=true
&AUTHPARAMS
```

###### Important

Before you specify your access key ID for the `AWSAccessKeyId` or
`Credential` parameter, review and follow the guidance in
[AWS security credentials](../../../../services/iam/latest/userguide/security-creds.md).

## Query parameters

Each Query request must include required common parameters to handle authentication and
selection of an action. Query parameters are case sensitive.

Some operations take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the
_param.n_ notation, where _n_ is an
integer starting from 1.

The following example adds multiple devices to a block device mapping using a list
of `BlockDeviceMapping` parameters.

```nohighlight

http://ec2.amazonaws.com/?Action=RunInstances
&ImageId.1=ami-72aa081b
...
&BlockDeviceMapping.1.DeviceName=/dev/sdj
&BlockDeviceMapping.1.Ebs.NoDevice=true
&BlockDeviceMapping.2.DeviceName=/dev/sdh
&BlockDeviceMapping.2.Ebs.VolumeSize=300
&BlockDeviceMapping.3.DeviceName=/dev/sdc
&BlockDeviceMapping.3.VirtualName=ephemeral1
&AUTHPARAMS
```

## Query API authentication

You can send Query requests over either the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.

Regardless of which protocol you use, you must include a signature in every Query request.
Amazon EC2 supports Signature Version 2 and Signature Version 4. We recommend that you use
Signature Version 4. For more information, see [Signing AWS API requests](../../../../services/iam/latest/userguide/reference-aws-signing.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

Signature Version 4 requests allow you to specify all the authorization parameters in a
single header, for example:

```nohighlight

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
X-Amz-Date: 20130813T150211Z
Host: ec2.amazonaws.com
Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=AKIDEXAMPLE/202230813/us-east-1/ec2/aws4_request, SignedHeaders=content-type;host;x-amz-date, Signature=ced6826de92d2bdeed8f846f0bf508e8559e98e4b0194b84example54174deb456c

http://ec2.amazonaws.com/?Action=RunInstances
ImageId=ami-2bb65342
&MaxCount=3
&MinCount=1
&Monitoring.Enabled=true
&Placement.AvailabilityZone=us-east-1a
&Version=2016-11-15
```

## Query response structures

In response to a Query request, the service returns an XML data structure that conforms to
an XML schema defined for Amazon EC2. The structure of an XML response is specific to the
associated request. In general, the response data types are named according to the operation
performed and whether the data type is a container (can have children). Examples of
containers include `groupSet` for security groups and `keySet` for key
pairs (see the example that follows). Item elements are children of containers, and their
contents vary according to the container's role.

Every successful response includes a request ID in a `requestId` element, and
every unsuccessful response includes a request ID in a `RequestID`
element. The value is a unique string that AWS assigns. If you ever have issues with
a particular request, AWS will ask for the request ID to help troubleshoot the
issue. The following shows an example response.

```nohighlight

<DescribeKeyPairsResponse xmlns="http://ec2.amazonaws.com/doc/2016-11-15/">
  <requestId>7a62c49f-347e-4fc4-9331-6e8eEXAMPLE</requestId>
  <keySet>
    <item>
      <keyName>gsg-keypair</keyName>
      <keyFingerprint>
         00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00
      </keyFingerprint>
    </item>
  </keySet>
</DescribeKeyPairsResponse>
```

###### Considerations

- As of July 31 2024, for any new Amazon EC2 API actions or newly supported AWS Regions,
the XML data structures in the responses won't include new lines and indentations.
If you use a custom client, ensure that it does not rely on the responses
including new lines and indentations.

- As of July 31 2025, the XML data structures in the responses will no longer include
new lines and indentations. This change will reduce the size of the responses.
If you use a custom client, ensure that it does not rely on the responses
including new lines and indentations.

- The order of the elements in the response, including those within nested structures,
might vary. Applications should not assume that the elements appear in a
particular order.

## Pagination

For actions that can return a long list of items, the Amazon EC2 API includes parameters
to support pagination: `MaxResults`, `NextToken` (input), and
`nextToken` (output). With pagination, you specify a size for
`MaxResults` and then each call returns 0 to `MaxResults` items
and sets `nextToken`. If there are additional items to iterate,
`nextToken` is non-null and you can specify its value in the
`NextToken` parameter of a subsequent call to get the next set of items.
With pagination, you continue to call the action until `nextToken` is
null, even if you receive less than `MaxResults` items, including zero items.

If you call a describe API action with both a list of IDs and `MaxResults`,
the request fails with the error `InvalidParameterCombination`.

We recommend that you use pagination when using describe actions that can
potentially return a large number of results, such as `DescribeInstances`.
Using pagination bounds the number of items returned and the time it takes for these
calls to return.

For more information, see [Pagination](../../../../services/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-pagination.md) in the _Amazon EC2 Developer Guide_.

## Preventing requests over HTTP

If your workload does not require you to use HTTP, we recommend that you avoid
using it to prevent transmitting and receiving unencrypted data, and to use HTTPS
instead. You can use the [`aws:SecureTransport`](../../../../services/iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-condition-keys.md#condition-keys-securetransport) global IAM condition key in
your IAM policies to prevent users from sending requests over HTTP.

The following example policy prevents users from sending requests over HTTP.

```json

{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowAllEC2HttpsRequests",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:*",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEqualsIgnoreCase": {
                    "aws:SecureTransport": "true"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
