# CreateReplaceRootVolumeTask

Replaces the EBS-backed root volume for a `running` instance with a new
volume that is restored to the original root volume's launch state, that is restored to a
specific snapshot taken from the original root volume, or that is restored from an AMI
that has the same key characteristics as that of the instance.

For more information, see [Replace a root volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/replace-root.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**ClientToken**

Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request.
If you do not specify a client token, a randomly generated token is used for the request
to ensure idempotency. For more information, see [Ensuring idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html).

Type: String

Required: No

**DeleteReplacedRootVolume**

Indicates whether to automatically delete the original root volume after the root volume
replacement task completes. To delete the original root volume, specify `true`.
If you choose to keep the original root volume after the replacement task completes, you must
manually delete it when you no longer need it.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**DryRun**

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request,
and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`.
Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**ImageId**

The ID of the AMI to use to restore the root volume. The specified AMI must have the
same product code, billing information, architecture type, and virtualization type as
that of the instance.

If you want to restore the replacement volume from a specific snapshot, or if you want
to restore it to its launch state, omit this parameter.

Type: String

Required: No

**InstanceId**

The ID of the instance for which to replace the root volume.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**SnapshotId**

The ID of the snapshot from which to restore the replacement root volume. The
specified snapshot must be a snapshot that you previously created from the original
root volume.

If you want to restore the replacement root volume to the initial launch state,
or if you want to restore the replacement root volume from an AMI, omit this
parameter.

Type: String

Required: No

**TagSpecification.N**

The tags to apply to the root volume replacement task.

Type: Array of [TagSpecification](api-tagspecification.md) objects

Required: No

**VolumeInitializationRate**

Specifies the Amazon EBS Provisioned Rate for Volume Initialization (volume initialization rate), in MiB/s, at which to download
the snapshot blocks from Amazon S3 to the replacement root volume. This is also known as
_volume initialization_. Specifying a volume initialization rate ensures that
the volume is initialized at a predictable and consistent rate after creation.

Omit this parameter if:

- You want to create the volume using fast snapshot restore. You must specify a snapshot
that is enabled for fast snapshot restore. In this case, the volume is fully initialized at
creation.

###### Note

If you specify a snapshot that is enabled for fast snapshot restore and a volume initialization rate,
the volume will be initialized at the specified rate instead of fast snapshot restore.

- You want to create a volume that is initialized at the default rate.

For more information, see [Initialize Amazon EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/initalize-volume.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

Valid range: 100 - 300 MiB/s

Type: Long

Required: No

## Response Elements

Type: [ReplaceRootVolumeTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ReplaceRootVolumeTask.html) object

**requestId**

The ID of the request.

Type: String
