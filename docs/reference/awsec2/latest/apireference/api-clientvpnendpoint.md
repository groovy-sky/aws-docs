**clientRouteEnforcementOptions**

Client route enforcement is a feature of the Client VPN service that helps enforce administrator defined routes on devices connected through the VPN. T
his feature helps improve your security posture by ensuring that network traffic originating from a connected client is not inadvertently sent outside the VPN tunnel.

Client route enforcement works by monitoring the route table of a connected device for routing policy changes to the VPN connection. If the feature detects any VPN routing policy modifications, it will automatically force an update to the route table,
reverting it back to the expected route configurations.
