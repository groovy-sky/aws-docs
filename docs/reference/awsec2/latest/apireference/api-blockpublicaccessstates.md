# BlockPublicAccessStates

- `off`: VPC BPA is not enabled and traffic is allowed to and from internet gateways and egress-only internet gateways in this Region.

- `block-bidirectional`: Block all traffic to and from internet gateways and egress-only internet gateways in this Region (except for excluded VPCs and subnets).

- `block-ingress`: Block all internet traffic to the VPCs in this Region (except for VPCs or subnets which are excluded). Only traffic to and from NAT gateways and egress-only internet gateways is allowed because these gateways only allow outbound connections to be established.
