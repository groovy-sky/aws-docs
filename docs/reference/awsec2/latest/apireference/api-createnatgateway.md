# CreateNatGateway

Creates a NAT gateway in the specified subnet. This action creates a network interface
in the specified subnet with a private IP address from the IP address range of the
subnet. You can create either a public NAT gateway or a private NAT gateway.

With a public NAT gateway, internet-bound traffic from a private subnet can be routed
to the NAT gateway, so that instances in a private subnet can connect to the internet.

With a private NAT gateway, private communication is routed across VPCs and on-premises
networks through a transit gateway or virtual private gateway. Common use cases include
running large workloads behind a small pool of allowlisted IPv4 addresses, preserving
private IPv4 addresses, and communicating between overlapping networks.

For more information, see [NAT gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

###### Important

When you create a public NAT gateway and assign it an EIP or secondary EIPs,
the network border group of the EIPs must match the network border group of the Availability Zone (AZ)
that the public NAT gateway is in. If it's not the same, the NAT gateway will fail to launch.
You can see the network border group for the subnet's AZ by viewing the details of the subnet.
Similarly, you can view the network border group of an EIP by viewing the details of the EIP address.
For more information about network border groups and EIPs, see [Allocate an Elastic IP address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/WorkWithEIPs.html)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**AllocationId**

\[Public NAT gateways only\] The allocation ID of an Elastic IP address to associate
with the NAT gateway. You cannot specify an Elastic IP address with a private NAT gateway.
If the Elastic IP address is associated with another resource, you must first disassociate it.

Type: String

Required: No

**AvailabilityMode**

Specifies whether to create a zonal (single-AZ) or regional (multi-AZ) NAT gateway. Defaults to `zonal`.

A zonal NAT gateway is a NAT Gateway that provides redundancy and scalability within a single availability zone. A regional NAT gateway is a single NAT Gateway that works across multiple availability zones (AZs) in your VPC, providing redundancy, scalability and availability across all the AZs in a Region.

For more information, see [Regional NAT gateways for automatic multi-AZ expansion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/nat-gateways-regional.html) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

Type: String

Valid Values: `zonal | regional`

Required: No

**AvailabilityZoneAddress.N**

For regional NAT gateways only: Specifies which Availability Zones you want the NAT gateway to support and the Elastic IP addresses (EIPs) to use in each AZ. The regional NAT gateway uses these EIPs to handle outbound NAT traffic from their respective AZs. If not specified, the NAT gateway will automatically expand to new AZs and associate EIPs upon detection of an elastic network interface. If you specify this parameter, auto-expansion is disabled and you must manually manage AZ coverage.

A regional NAT gateway is a single NAT Gateway that works across multiple availability zones (AZs) in your VPC, providing redundancy, scalability and availability across all the AZs in a Region.

For more information, see [Regional NAT gateways for automatic multi-AZ expansion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/nat-gateways-regional.html) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

Type: Array of [AvailabilityZoneAddress](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AvailabilityZoneAddress.html) objects

Required: No

**ClientToken**

Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the
request. For more information, see [Ensuring idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html).

Constraint: Maximum 64 ASCII characters.

Type: String

Required: No

**ConnectivityType**

Indicates whether the NAT gateway supports public or private connectivity.
The default is public connectivity.

Type: String

Valid Values: `private | public`

Required: No

**DryRun**

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request,
and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`.
Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**PrivateIpAddress**

The private IPv4 address to assign to the NAT gateway. If you don't provide an address, a private IPv4 address will be automatically assigned.

Type: String

Required: No

**SecondaryAllocationId.N**

Secondary EIP allocation IDs. For more information, see [Create a NAT gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/nat-gateway-working-with.html)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

Type: Array of strings

Required: No

**SecondaryPrivateIpAddress.N**

Secondary private IPv4 addresses. For more information about secondary addresses, see
[Create a NAT gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/nat-gateway-working-with.html) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

Type: Array of strings

Required: No

**SecondaryPrivateIpAddressCount**

\[Private NAT gateway only\] The number of secondary private IPv4 addresses you want to assign to the NAT gateway.
For more information about secondary addresses, see [Create a NAT gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/nat-gateway-working-with.html)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 31.

Required: No

**SubnetId**

The ID of the subnet in which to create the NAT gateway.

Type: String

Required: No

**TagSpecification.N**

The tags to assign to the NAT gateway.

Type: Array of [TagSpecification](api-tagspecification.md) objects

Required: No

**VpcId**

The ID of the VPC where you want to create a regional NAT gateway.

Type: String

Required: No

## Response Elements

The following elements are returned by the service.

**clientToken**

Unique, case-sensitive identifier to ensure the idempotency of the request. Only returned if a client token was provided in the request.

Type: String

**natGateway**

Information about the NAT gateway.

Type: [NatGateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_NatGateway.html) object

**requestId**

The ID of the request.

Type: String
