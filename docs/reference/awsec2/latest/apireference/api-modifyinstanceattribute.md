# ModifyInstanceAttribute

Modifies the specified attribute of the specified instance. You can specify only one
attribute at a time.

**Note:** Using this action to change the security groups
associated with an elastic network interface (ENI) attached to an instance can
result in an error if the instance has more than one ENI. To change the security groups
associated with an ENI attached to an instance that has multiple ENIs, we recommend that
you use the [ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute](api-modifynetworkinterfaceattribute.md) action.

To modify some attributes, the instance must be stopped. For more information, see
[Modify a stopped instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_ChangingAttributesWhileInstanceStopped.html) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**Attribute**

The name of the attribute to modify.

###### Note

When changing the instance type: If the original instance type is configured for
configurable bandwidth, and the desired instance type doesn't support configurable
bandwidth, first set the existing bandwidth configuration to `default`
using the [ModifyInstanceNetworkPerformanceOptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyInstanceNetworkPerformanceOptions.html)
operation.

Type: String

Valid Values: `disableApiTermination | instanceType | kernel | ramdisk | instanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior | blockDeviceMapping | userData | sourceDestCheck | groupSet | ebsOptimized | sriovNetSupport | enaSupport | nvmeSupport | disableApiStop | enclaveOptions`

Required: No

**BlockDeviceMapping.N**

Modifies the `DeleteOnTermination` attribute for volumes that are currently
attached. The volume must be owned by the caller. If no value is specified for
`DeleteOnTermination`, the default is `true` and the volume is
deleted when the instance is terminated. You can't modify the `DeleteOnTermination`
attribute for volumes that are attached to AWS-managed resources.

To add instance store volumes to an Amazon EBS-backed instance, you must add them when
you launch the instance. For more information, see [Update the block device mapping when launching an instance](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/block-device-mapping-concepts.md#Using_OverridingAMIBDM) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

Type: Array of [InstanceBlockDeviceMappingSpecification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_InstanceBlockDeviceMappingSpecification.html) objects

Required: No

**DisableApiStop**

Indicates whether an instance is enabled for stop protection. For more information,
see [Enable stop\
protection for your instance](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-stop-protection.md).

Type: [AttributeBooleanValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AttributeBooleanValue.html) object

Required: No

**DisableApiTermination**

Enable or disable termination protection for the instance. If the value is `true`,
you can't terminate the instance using the Amazon EC2 console, command line interface, or API.
You can't enable termination protection for Spot Instances.

Type: [AttributeBooleanValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AttributeBooleanValue.html) object

Required: No

**DryRun**

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the operation, without actually making the
request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is
`DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**EbsOptimized**

Specifies whether the instance is optimized for Amazon EBS I/O. This optimization
provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to
provide optimal EBS I/O performance. This optimization isn't available with all instance
types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS Optimized instance.

Type: [AttributeBooleanValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AttributeBooleanValue.html) object

Required: No

**EnaSupport**

Set to `true` to enable enhanced networking with ENA for the
instance.

This option is supported only for HVM instances. Specifying this option with a PV
instance can make it unreachable.

Type: [AttributeBooleanValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AttributeBooleanValue.html) object

Required: No

**GroupId.N**

Replaces the security groups of the instance with the specified security groups.
You must specify the ID of at least one security group, even if it's just the default
security group for the VPC.

Type: Array of strings

Required: No

**InstanceId**

The ID of the instance.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior**

Specifies whether an instance stops or terminates when you initiate shutdown from the
instance (using the operating system command for system shutdown).

Type: [AttributeValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AttributeValue.html) object

Required: No

**InstanceType**

Changes the instance type to the specified value. For more information, see [Instance\
types](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/instance-types.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_. If the instance type is
not valid, the error returned is `InvalidInstanceAttributeValue`.

Type: [AttributeValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AttributeValue.html) object

Required: No

**Kernel**

Changes the instance's kernel to the specified value. We recommend that you use
PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see [PV-GRUB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedKernels.html).

Type: [AttributeValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AttributeValue.html) object

Required: No

**Ramdisk**

Changes the instance's RAM disk to the specified value. We recommend that you use
PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see [PV-GRUB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedKernels.html).

Type: [AttributeValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AttributeValue.html) object

Required: No

**SourceDestCheck**

Enable or disable source/destination checks, which ensure that the instance is either
the source or the destination of any traffic that it receives. If the value is
`true`, source/destination checks are enabled; otherwise, they are
disabled. The default value is `true`. You must disable source/destination
checks if the instance runs services such as network address translation, routing, or
firewalls.

Type: [AttributeBooleanValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AttributeBooleanValue.html) object

Required: No

**SriovNetSupport**

Set to `simple` to enable enhanced networking with the Intel 82599 Virtual
Function interface for the instance.

There is no way to disable enhanced networking with the Intel 82599 Virtual Function
interface at this time.

This option is supported only for HVM instances. Specifying this option with a PV
instance can make it unreachable.

Type: [AttributeValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AttributeValue.html) object

Required: No

**UserData**

Changes the instance's user data to the specified value. User data must be base64-encoded.
Depending on the tool or SDK that you're using, the base64-encoding might be performed for you.
For more information, see [Work with instance user data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-add-user-data.html).

Type: [BlobAttributeValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_BlobAttributeValue.html) object
