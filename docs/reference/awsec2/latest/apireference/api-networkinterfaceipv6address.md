**isPrimaryIpv6**

Determines if an IPv6 address associated with a network interface is the primary IPv6
address. When you enable an IPv6 GUA address to be a primary IPv6, the first IPv6 GUA
will be made the primary IPv6 address until the instance is terminated or the network
interface is detached. For more information, see [ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute.html).

Type: Boolean

**publicIpv6DnsName**
