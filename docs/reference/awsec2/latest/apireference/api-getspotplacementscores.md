# GetSpotPlacementScores
<a name="API_GetSpotPlacementScores"></a>

Calculates the Spot placement score for a Region or Availability Zone based on the specified target capacity and compute requirements.

You can specify your compute requirements either by using `InstanceRequirementsWithMetadata` and letting Amazon EC2 choose the optimal instance types to fulfill your Spot request, or you can specify the instance types by using `InstanceTypes`.

For more information, see [Spot placement score](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-placement-score.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

## Request Parameters
<a name="API_GetSpotPlacementScores_RequestParameters"></a>

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](CommonParameters.md).

 **DryRun**
Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.
Type: Boolean
Required: No

 **InstanceRequirementsWithMetadata**
The attributes for the instance types. When you specify instance attributes, Amazon EC2 will identify instance types with those attributes.
If you specify `InstanceRequirementsWithMetadata`, you can't specify `InstanceTypes`.
Type: [InstanceRequirementsWithMetadataRequest](API_InstanceRequirementsWithMetadataRequest.md) object
Required: No

 **InstanceType.N**
The instance types. We recommend that you specify at least three instance types. If you specify one or two instance types, or specify variations of a single instance type (for example, an `m3.xlarge` with and without instance storage), the returned placement score will always be low.
If you specify `InstanceTypes`, you can't specify `InstanceRequirementsWithMetadata`.
Type: Array of strings
Array Members: Minimum number of 0 items. Maximum number of 1000 items.
Required: No

 **MaxResults**
The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination).
Type: Integer
Valid Range: Minimum value of 10. Maximum value of 1000.
Required: No

 **NextToken**
The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.
Type: String
Required: No

 **RegionName.N**
The Regions used to narrow down the list of Regions to be scored. Enter the Region code, for example, `us-east-1`.
Type: Array of strings
Array Members: Minimum number of 0 items. Maximum number of 10 items.
Required: No

 **SingleAvailabilityZone**
Specify `true` so that the response returns a list of scored Availability Zones. Otherwise, the response returns a list of scored Regions.
A list of scored Availability Zones is useful if you want to launch all of your Spot capacity into a single Availability Zone.
Type: Boolean
Required: No

 **TargetCapacity**
The target capacity.
Type: Integer
Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 2000000000.
Required: Yes

 **TargetCapacityUnitType**
The unit for the target capacity.
Type: String
Valid Values: `vcpu | memory-mib | units`
Required: No

## Response Elements
<a name="API_GetSpotPlacementScores_ResponseElements"></a>

The following elements are returned by the service.

 **nextToken**
The token to include in another request to get the next page of items. This value is `null` when there are no more items to return.
Type: String

 **requestId**
The ID of the request.
Type: String

 **spotPlacementScoreSet**
The Spot placement score for the top 10 Regions or Availability Zones, scored on a scale from 1 to 10. Each score  reflects how likely it is that each Region or Availability Zone will succeed at fulfilling the specified target capacity  *at the time of the Spot placement score request*. A score of `10` means that your Spot capacity request is highly likely to succeed in that Region or Availability Zone.
If you request a Spot placement score for Regions, a high score assumes that your fleet request will be configured to use all Availability Zones and the `capacity-optimized` allocation strategy. If you request a Spot placement score for Availability Zones, a high score assumes that your fleet request will be configured to use a single Availability Zone and the `capacity-optimized` allocation strategy.
Different  Regions or Availability Zones might return the same score.
The Spot placement score serves as a recommendation only. No score guarantees that your Spot request will be fully or partially fulfilled.
Type: Array of [SpotPlacementScore](API_SpotPlacementScore.md) objects
