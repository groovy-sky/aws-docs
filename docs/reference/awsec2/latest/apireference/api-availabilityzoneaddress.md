# AvailabilityZoneAddress
<a name="API_AvailabilityZoneAddress"></a>

For regional NAT gateways only: The configuration specifying which Elastic IP address (EIP) to use for handling outbound NAT traffic from a specific Availability Zone.

A regional NAT gateway is a single NAT Gateway that works across multiple availability zones (AZs) in your VPC, providing redundancy, scalability and availability across all the AZs in a Region.

For more information, see [Regional NAT gateways for automatic multi-AZ expansion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/nat-gateways-regional.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.
