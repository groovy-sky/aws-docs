## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**DryRun**

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request,
and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is
`DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**Filter.N**

The filters.

- `creation-time` \- The time when the report was created, in the ISO 8601
format in the UTC time zone (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ), for example,
`2025-11-29T11:04:43.305Z`. You can use a wildcard ( `*`), for
example, `2025-11-29T*`, which matches an entire day.

- `state` \- The state of the report ( `available` \|
`pending` \| `error`).

- `tag:<key>` \- The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value.
For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.

- `tag-key` \- The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
