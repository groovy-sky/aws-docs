# CreateFlowLogs

Creates one or more flow logs to capture information about IP traffic for a specific network interface,
subnet, or VPC.

Flow log data for a monitored network interface is recorded as flow log records, which are log events
consisting of fields that describe the traffic flow. For more information, see
[Flow log records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-log-records.html)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

When publishing to CloudWatch Logs, flow log records are published to a log group, and each network
interface has a unique log stream in the log group. When publishing to Amazon S3, flow log records for all
of the monitored network interfaces are published to a single log file object that is stored in the specified
bucket.

For more information, see [VPC Flow Logs](../../../../services/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.md)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**ClientToken**

Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the
request. For more information, see [How to ensure\
idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html).

Type: String

Required: No

**DeliverCrossAccountRole**

The ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon EC2 to publish flow logs across accounts.

Type: String

Required: No

**DeliverLogsPermissionArn**

The ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon EC2 to publish flow logs to the log destination.

This parameter is required if the destination type is `cloud-watch-logs`,
or if the destination type is `kinesis-data-firehose` and the delivery stream
and the resources to monitor are in different accounts.

Type: String

Required: No

**DestinationOptions**

The destination options.

Type: [DestinationOptionsRequest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DestinationOptionsRequest.html) object

Required: No

**DryRun**

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request,
and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`.
Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**LogDestination**

The destination for the flow log data. The meaning of this parameter depends on the destination type.

- If the destination type is `cloud-watch-logs`, specify the ARN of a CloudWatch Logs log group. For example:

arn:aws:logs: _region_: _account\_id_:log-group: _my\_group_

Alternatively, use the `LogGroupName` parameter.

- If the destination type is `s3`, specify the ARN of an S3 bucket. For example:

arn:aws:s3::: _my\_bucket_/ _my\_subfolder_/

The subfolder is optional. Note that you can't use `AWSLogs` as a subfolder name.

- If the destination type is `kinesis-data-firehose`, specify the ARN of a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. For example:

arn:aws:firehose: _region_: _account\_id_:deliverystream: _my\_stream_

Type: String

Required: No

**LogDestinationType**

The type of destination for the flow log data.

Default: `cloud-watch-logs`

Type: String

Valid Values: `cloud-watch-logs | s3 | kinesis-data-firehose`

Required: No

**LogFormat**

The fields to include in the flow log record. List the fields in the order in which
they should appear. If you omit this parameter, the flow log is created using the
default format. If you specify this parameter, you must include at least one
field. For more information about the available fields, see [Flow log records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-log-records.html)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_ or [Transit Gateway Flow Log\
records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-flow-logs.html#flow-log-records) in the _AWS Transit Gateway Guide_.

Specify the fields using the `${field-id}` format, separated by spaces.

Type: String

Required: No

**LogGroupName**

The name of a new or existing CloudWatch Logs log group where Amazon EC2 publishes your flow logs.

This parameter is valid only if the destination type is `cloud-watch-logs`.

Type: String

Required: No

**MaxAggregationInterval**

The maximum interval of time during which a flow of packets is captured and aggregated into a flow log record.
The possible values are 60 seconds (1 minute) or 600 seconds (10 minutes).
This parameter must be 60 seconds for transit gateway resource types.

When a network interface is attached to a [Nitro-based\
instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/ec2-nitro-instances.html), the aggregation interval is always 60 seconds or less, regardless
of the value that you specify.

Default: 600

Type: Integer

Required: No

**ResourceId.N**

The IDs of the resources to monitor. For example, if the resource type is
`VPC`, specify the IDs of the VPCs.

Constraints: Maximum of 25 for transit gateway resource types. Maximum of 1000 for the
other resource types.

Type: Array of strings

Required: Yes

**ResourceType**

The type of resource to monitor.

Type: String

Valid Values: `VPC | Subnet | NetworkInterface | TransitGateway | TransitGatewayAttachment | RegionalNatGateway`

Required: Yes

**TagSpecification.N**

The tags to apply to the flow logs.

Type: Array of [TagSpecification](api-tagspecification.md) objects

Required: No

**TrafficType**

The type of traffic to monitor (accepted traffic, rejected traffic, or all traffic).
This parameter is not supported for transit gateway resource types. It is required for
the other resource types.

Type: String

Valid Values: `ACCEPT | REJECT | ALL`

Required: No

## Response Elements

The following elements are returned by the service.

**clientToken**

Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the
request.

Type: String

**flowLogIdSet**

The IDs of the flow logs.

Type: Array of strings

**requestId**

The ID of the request.

Type: String

**unsuccessful**

Information about the flow logs that could not be created successfully.

Type: Array of [UnsuccessfulItem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_UnsuccessfulItem.html) objects
