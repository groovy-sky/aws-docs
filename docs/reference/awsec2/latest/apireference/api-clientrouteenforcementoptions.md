# ClientRouteEnforcementOptions

Client Route Enforcement is a feature of Client VPN that helps enforce administrator defined
routes on devices connected through the VPN. This feature helps improve your security
posture by ensuring that network traffic originating from a connected client is not
inadvertently sent outside the VPN tunnel.

Client Route Enforcement works by monitoring the route table of a connected device for
routing policy changes to the VPN connection. If the feature detects any VPN routing
policy modifications, it will automatically force an update to the route table,
reverting it back to the expected route configurations.
