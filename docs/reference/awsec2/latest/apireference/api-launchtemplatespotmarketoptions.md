# LaunchTemplateSpotMarketOptions

The options for Spot Instances.

## Contents

**blockDurationMinutes**

The required duration for the Spot Instances (also known as Spot blocks), in minutes.
This value must be a multiple of 60 (60, 120, 180, 240, 300, or 360).

Type: Integer

Required: No

**instanceInterruptionBehavior**

The behavior when a Spot Instance is interrupted.

Type: String

Valid Values: `hibernate | stop | terminate`

Required: No

**maxPrice**

The maximum hourly price you're willing to pay for a Spot Instance. We do not
recommend using this parameter because it can lead to increased interruptions. If you do
not specify this parameter, you will pay the current Spot price. If you do specify this
parameter, it must be more than USD $0.001. Specifying a value below USD $0.001 will
result in an `InvalidParameterValue` error message when the launch template
is used to launch an instance.

Type: String

Required: No

**spotInstanceType**

The Spot Instance request type.

Type: String

Valid Values: `one-time | persistent`

Required: No

**validUntil**

The end date of the request. For a one-time request, the request remains active until
all instances launch, the request is canceled, or this date is reached. If the request
is persistent, it remains active until it is canceled or this date and time is
reached.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No
