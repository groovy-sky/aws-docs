# IpamPrefixListResolverRule

Describes a CIDR selection rule.

CIDR selection rules define the business logic for selecting CIDRs from IPAM. If a CIDR matches any of the rules, it will be included. If a rule has multiple conditions, the CIDR has to match every condition of that rule. You can create a prefix list resolver without any CIDR selection rules, but it will generate empty versions (containing no CIDRs) until you add rules.

## Contents

**ConditionSet.N**

The conditions that determine which CIDRs are selected by this rule. Conditions specify criteria such as resource type, tags, account IDs, and Regions.

Type: Array of [IpamPrefixListResolverRuleCondition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_IpamPrefixListResolverRuleCondition.html) objects

Required: No

**ipamScopeId**

The ID of the IPAM scope from which to select CIDRs. This determines whether to select from public or private IP address space.

Type: String

Required: No

**resourceType**

For rules of type `ipam-resource-cidr`, this is the resource type.

Type: String

Valid Values: `vpc | subnet | eip | public-ipv4-pool | ipv6-pool | eni | anycast-ip-list`

Required: No

**ruleType**

The type of CIDR selection rule. Valid values include `include` for selecting CIDRs that match the conditions, and `exclude` for excluding CIDRs that match the conditions.

Type: String

Valid Values: `static-cidr | ipam-resource-cidr | ipam-pool-cidr`

Required: No

**staticCidr**

A fixed list of CIDRs that do not change (like a manual list replicated across Regions).
