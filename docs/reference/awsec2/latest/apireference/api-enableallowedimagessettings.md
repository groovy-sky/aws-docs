# EnableAllowedImagesSettings

Enables Allowed AMIs for your account in the specified AWS Region. Two values are
accepted:

- `enabled`: The image criteria in your Allowed AMIs settings are applied. As
a result, only AMIs matching these criteria are discoverable and can be used by your
account to launch instances.

- `audit-mode`: The image criteria in your Allowed AMIs settings are not
applied. No restrictions are placed on AMI discoverability or usage. Users in your account
can launch instances using any public AMI or AMI shared with your account.

The purpose of `audit-mode` is to indicate which AMIs will be affected when
Allowed AMIs is `enabled`. In `audit-mode`, each AMI displays either
`"ImageAllowed": true` or `"ImageAllowed": false` to indicate
whether the AMI will be discoverable and available to users in the account when Allowed
AMIs is enabled.

###### Note

The Allowed AMIs feature does not restrict the AMIs owned by your account. Regardless of
the criteria you set, the AMIs created by your account will always be discoverable and
usable by users in your account.

For more information, see [Control the discovery and use of AMIs in\
Amazon EC2 with Allowed AMIs](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-allowed-amis.md) in
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.
