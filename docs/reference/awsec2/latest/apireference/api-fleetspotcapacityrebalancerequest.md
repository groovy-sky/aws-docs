 ** ReplacementStrategy **
The replacement strategy to use. Only available for fleets of type `maintain`.
 `launch` - EC2 Fleet launches a replacement Spot Instance when a rebalance notification is emitted for an existing Spot Instance in the fleet. EC2 Fleet does not terminate the instances that receive a rebalance notification. You can terminate the old instances, or you can leave them running. You are charged for all instances while they are running.
 `launch-before-terminate` - EC2 Fleet launches a replacement Spot Instance when a rebalance notification is emitted for an existing Spot Instance in the fleet, and then, after a delay that you specify (in `TerminationDelay`), terminates the instances that received a rebalance notification.
Type: String
Valid Values: `launch | launch-before-terminate`
Required: No

 ** TerminationDelay **
The amount of time (in seconds) that Amazon EC2 waits before terminating the old Spot Instance after launching a new replacement Spot Instance.
Required when `ReplacementStrategy` is set to `launch-before-terminate`.
Not valid when `ReplacementStrategy` is set to `launch`.
Valid values: Minimum value of `120` seconds. Maximum value of `7200` seconds.
Type: Integer
Required: No
