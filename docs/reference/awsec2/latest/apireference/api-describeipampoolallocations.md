# DescribeIpamPoolAllocations
<a name="API_DescribeIpamPoolAllocations"></a>

Describes IPAM pool allocations. You can describe all allocations owned by you across all pools, or you can describe specific allocations by ID.

If you specify `IpamPoolAllocationIds`, the results include only the specified allocations. If you do not specify `IpamPoolAllocationIds`, the results include all allocations owned by you. You can use `Filters` to narrow the results.

**Note**
This action returns only allocations directly owned by you. To view all allocations in a pool you own or that has been shared with you, including allocations owned by other accounts, use [GetIpamPoolAllocations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_GetIpamPoolAllocations.html).
