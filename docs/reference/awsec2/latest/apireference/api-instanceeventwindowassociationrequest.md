can be associated with an event window.

## Contents

**DedicatedHostId.N**

The IDs of the Dedicated Hosts to associate with the event window.

Type: Array of strings

Required: No

**InstanceId.N**

The IDs of the instances to associate with the event window. If the instance is on a
Dedicated Host, you can't specify the Instance ID parameter; you must use the Dedicated
Host ID parameter.

Required: No

**InstanceTag.N**

The instance tags to associate with the event window. Any instances associated with the
tags will be associated with the event window.

Note that while you can't create tag keys beginning with `aws:`, you can
specify existing AWS managed tag keys (with the `aws:` prefix) when specifying
them as targets to associate with the event window.
