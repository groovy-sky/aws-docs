# SpotOptions

Describes the configuration of Spot Instances in an EC2 Fleet.

## Contents

**allocationStrategy**

The strategy that determines how to allocate the target Spot Instance capacity across the Spot Instance
pools specified by the EC2 Fleet launch configuration. For more information, see [Allocation strategies for Spot Instances](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-fleet-allocation-strategy.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

price-capacity-optimized (recommended)

EC2 Fleet identifies the pools with
the highest capacity availability for the number of instances that are launching. This means
that we will request Spot Instances from the pools that we believe have the lowest chance of interruption
in the near term. EC2 Fleet then requests Spot Instances from the lowest priced of these pools.

capacity-optimized

EC2 Fleet identifies the pools with
the highest capacity availability for the number of instances that are launching. This means
that we will request Spot Instances from the pools that we believe have the lowest chance of interruption
in the near term. To give certain
instance types a higher chance of launching first, use
`capacity-optimized-prioritized`. Set a priority for each instance type by
using the `Priority` parameter for `LaunchTemplateOverrides`. You can
assign the same priority to different `LaunchTemplateOverrides`. EC2 implements
the priorities on a best-effort basis, but optimizes for capacity first.
`capacity-optimized-prioritized` is supported only if your EC2 Fleet uses a
launch template. Note that if the On-Demand `AllocationStrategy` is set to
`prioritized`, the same priority is applied when fulfilling On-Demand
capacity.

diversified

EC2 Fleet requests instances from all of the Spot Instance pools that you
specify.

lowest-price (not recommended)

###### Important

We don't recommend the `lowest-price` allocation strategy because
it has the highest risk of interruption for your Spot Instances.

EC2 Fleet requests instances from the lowest priced Spot Instance pool that has available
capacity. If the lowest priced pool doesn't have available capacity, the Spot Instances
come from the next lowest priced pool that has available capacity. If a pool runs
out of capacity before fulfilling your desired capacity, EC2 Fleet will continue to
fulfill your request by drawing from the next lowest priced pool. To ensure that
your desired capacity is met, you might receive Spot Instances from several pools. Because
this strategy only considers instance price and not capacity availability, it
might lead to high interruption rates.

Default: `lowest-price`

Type: String

Valid Values: `lowest-price | diversified | capacity-optimized | capacity-optimized-prioritized | price-capacity-optimized`

Required: No

**instanceInterruptionBehavior**

The behavior when a Spot Instance is interrupted.

Default: `terminate`

Type: String

Valid Values: `hibernate | stop | terminate`

Required: No

**instancePoolsToUseCount**

The number of Spot pools across which to allocate your target Spot capacity. Supported
only when `AllocationStrategy` is set to `lowest-price`. EC2 Fleet selects
the cheapest Spot pools and evenly allocates your target Spot capacity across the number of
Spot pools that you specify.

Note that EC2 Fleet attempts to draw Spot Instances from the number of pools that you specify on a
best effort basis. If a pool runs out of Spot capacity before fulfilling your target
capacity, EC2 Fleet will continue to fulfill your request by drawing from the next cheapest
pool. To ensure that your target capacity is met, you might receive Spot Instances from more than
the number of pools that you specified. Similarly, if most of the pools have no Spot
capacity, you might receive your full target capacity from fewer than the number of pools
that you specified.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**maintenanceStrategies**

The strategies for managing your workloads on your Spot Instances that will be
interrupted. Currently only the capacity rebalance strategy is available.

Type: [FleetSpotMaintenanceStrategies](api-fleetspotmaintenancestrategies.md) object

Required: No

**maxTotalPrice**

The maximum amount per hour for Spot Instances that you're willing to pay. We do not recommend
using this parameter because it can lead to increased interruptions. If you do not specify
this parameter, you will pay the current Spot price.

###### Important

If you specify a maximum price, your Spot Instances will be interrupted more frequently than if you do not specify this parameter.

###### Note

If your fleet includes T instances that are configured as `unlimited`, and
if their average CPU usage exceeds the baseline utilization, you will incur a charge for
surplus credits. The `maxTotalPrice` does not account for surplus credits,
and, if you use surplus credits, your final cost might be higher than what you specified
for `maxTotalPrice`. For more information, see [Surplus credits can incur charges](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/burstable-performance-instances-unlimited-mode-concepts.md#unlimited-mode-surplus-credits) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**minTargetCapacity**

The minimum target capacity for Spot Instances in the fleet. If this minimum capacity isn't
reached, no instances are launched.

Constraints: Maximum value of `1000`. Supported only for fleets of type
`instant`.

At least one of the following must be specified: `SingleAvailabilityZone` \|
`SingleInstanceType`

Type: Integer

Required: No

**singleAvailabilityZone**

Indicates that the fleet launches all Spot Instances into a single Availability Zone.

Supported only for fleets of type `instant`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**singleInstanceType**

Indicates that the fleet uses a single instance type to launch all Spot Instances in the
fleet.

Supported only for fleets of type `instant`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No
