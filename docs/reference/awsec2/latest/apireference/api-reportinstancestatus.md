# ReportInstanceStatus

Submits feedback about the status of an instance. The instance must be in the
`running` state. If your experience with the instance differs from the
instance status returned by [DescribeInstanceStatus](api-describeinstancestatus.md), use ReportInstanceStatus to report your experience with the instance. Amazon
EC2 collects this information to improve the accuracy of status checks.

Use of this action does not change the value returned by [DescribeInstanceStatus](api-describeinstancestatus.md).
