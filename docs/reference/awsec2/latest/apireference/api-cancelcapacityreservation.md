# CancelCapacityReservation
<a name="API_CancelCapacityReservation"></a>

Cancels the specified Capacity Reservation, releases the reserved capacity, and changes the Capacity Reservation's state to `cancelled`.

You can cancel a Capacity Reservation that is in the following states:
+  `assessing`
+  `scheduled` — requires a cancellation quote. Use `CreateCapacityReservationCancellationQuote` to generate a quote, then pass the quote ID with `ApplyCancellationCharges` set to `commitment-wind-down`. The cancellation charge depends on how close the reservation is to its start date.
+  `active` and there is no commitment duration or the commitment duration has elapsed.
+  `active` during the commitment duration — requires a cancellation quote. Use `CreateCapacityReservationCancellationQuote` to generate a quote, then pass the quote ID with `ApplyCancellationCharges` set to `commitment-wind-down`. The Capacity Reservation transitions to `cancelling` while charges are applied.
+  `delayed` — the commitment duration is waived, so no cancellation charge applies.

**Note**
You can't modify or cancel a Capacity Block. For more information, see [Capacity Blocks for ML](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-blocks.html).

Instances running in the reserved capacity continue running until you stop them. Stopped instances that target the Capacity Reservation can no longer launch. Modify these instances to either target a different Capacity Reservation, launch On-Demand Instance capacity, or run in any open Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes and sufficient capacity.
