# DescribeInstanceEventWindows

Describes the specified event windows or all event windows.

If you specify event window IDs, the output includes information for only the specified
event windows. If you specify filters, the output includes information for only those event
windows that meet the filter criteria. If you do not specify event windows IDs or filters,
the output includes information for all event windows, which can affect performance. We
recommend that you use pagination to ensure that the operation returns quickly and
successfully.

For more information, see [Define event windows for scheduled\
events](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/event-windows.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**DryRun**

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request,
and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`.
Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**Filter.N**

One or more filters.

- `dedicated-host-id` \- The event windows associated with the specified
Dedicated Host ID.

- `event-window-name` \- The event windows associated with the specified
names.

- `instance-id` \- The event windows associated with the specified
instance ID.

- `instance-tag` \- The event windows associated with the specified tag
and value.

- `instance-tag-key` \- The event windows associated with the specified
tag key, regardless of the value.

- `instance-tag-value` \- The event windows associated with the specified
tag value, regardless of the key.

- `tag:<key>` \- The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the
event window. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter
value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key
`Owner` and the value `CMX`, specify `tag:Owner`
for the filter name and `CMX` for the filter value.

- `tag-key` \- The key of a tag assigned to the event window. Use this
filter to find all event windows that have a tag with a specific key, regardless of
the tag value.

- `tag-value` \- The value of a tag assigned to the event window. Use this
filter to find all event windows that have a tag with a specific value, regardless of
the tag key.

Type: Array of [Filter](api-filter.md) objects

Required: No

**InstanceEventWindowId.N**

The IDs of the event windows.

Type: Array of strings

**MaxResults**

The maximum number of results to return in a single call. To retrieve the remaining

in the same call.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 20. Maximum value of 500.

Required: No

**instanceEventWindowSet**

Information about the event windows.
