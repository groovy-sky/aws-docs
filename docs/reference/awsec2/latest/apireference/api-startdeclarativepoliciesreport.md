# StartDeclarativePoliciesReport
<a name="API_StartDeclarativePoliciesReport"></a>

Generates an account status report. The report is generated asynchronously, and can take several hours to complete.

The report provides the current status of all attributes supported by declarative policies for the accounts within the specified scope. The scope is determined by the specified `TargetId`, which can represent an individual account, or all the accounts that fall under the specified organizational unit (OU) or root (the entire AWS Organization).

The report is saved to your specified S3 bucket, using the following path structure (with the capitalized placeholders representing your specific values):

 `s3://AMZN-S3-DEMO-BUCKET/YOUR-OPTIONAL-S3-PREFIX/ec2_TARGETID_REPORTID_YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ.csv`

**Prerequisites for generating a report**
+ The `StartDeclarativePoliciesReport` API can only be called by the management account or delegated administrators for the organization.
+ An S3 bucket must be available before generating the report (you can create a new one or use an existing one), it must be in the same Region where the report generation request is made, and it must have an appropriate bucket policy. For a sample S3 policy, see *Sample Amazon S3 policy* under [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_StartDeclarativePoliciesReport.html#API_StartDeclarativePoliciesReport_Examples).
+ Trusted access must be enabled for the service for which the declarative policy will enforce a baseline configuration. If you use the AWS Organizations console, this is done automatically when you enable declarative policies. The API uses the following service principal to identify the EC2 service: `ec2.amazonaws.com`. For more information on how to enable trusted access with the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs, see [Using Organizations with other AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html) in the * AWS Organizations User Guide*.
+ Only one report per organization can be generated at a time. Attempting to generate a report while another is in progress will result in an error.

For more information, including the required IAM permissions to run this API, see [Generating the account status report for declarative policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_declarative_status-report.html) in the * AWS Organizations User Guide*.

## Request Parameters
<a name="API_StartDeclarativePoliciesReport_RequestParameters"></a>

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](CommonParameters.md).

 **DryRun**
Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.
Type: Boolean
Required: No

 **S3Bucket**
The name of the S3 bucket where the report will be saved. The bucket must be in the same Region where the report generation request is made.
Type: String
Required: Yes

 **S3Prefix**
The prefix for your S3 object.
Type: String
Required: No

 **TagSpecification.N**
The tags to apply.
Type: Array of [TagSpecification](API_TagSpecification.md) objects
Required: No

 **TargetId**
The root ID, organizational unit ID, or account ID.
Format:
+ For root: `r-ab12`
+ For OU: `ou-ab12-cdef1234`
+ For account: `123456789012`
Type: String
Required: Yes

## Response Elements

The following elements are returned by the service.

 **reportId**
The ID of the report.
Type: String

 **requestId**
The ID of the request.
Type: String

## Errors

## Examples

### Sample Amazon S3 policy
<a name="API_StartDeclarativePoliciesReport_Example_1"></a>

Before generating a report, you must grant the EC2 Declarative Policies principal access to the Amazon S3 bucket where the report will be stored. To do this, attach the following policy to the bucket. Remember to replace *amzn-s3-demo-bucket* in the policy with your actual S3 bucket name, and *identity\_ARN* with the [IAM identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-arns) used to call the `StartDeclarativePoliciesReport` API. The statement in the `Condition` element ensures that the service can call the operation on your behalf using the credentials used to call the `StartDeclarativePoliciesReport` API.
