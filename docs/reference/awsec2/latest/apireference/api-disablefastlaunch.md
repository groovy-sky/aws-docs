# DisableFastLaunch

Discontinue Windows fast launch for a Windows AMI, and clean up existing pre-provisioned
snapshots. After you disable Windows fast launch, the AMI uses the standard launch process for
each new instance. Amazon EC2 must remove all pre-provisioned snapshots before you can enable
Windows fast launch again.

###### Note

You can only change these settings for Windows AMIs that you own or that have been
shared with you.
