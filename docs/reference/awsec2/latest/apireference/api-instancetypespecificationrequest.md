# InstanceTypeSpecificationRequest
<a name="API_InstanceTypeSpecificationRequest"></a>

The instance type specification for an AMI, which contains lists of supported and unsupported instance types that define which instance types are compatible with the AMI.

## Contents
<a name="API_InstanceTypeSpecificationRequest_Contents"></a>

 ** SupportedInstanceType.N **
The instance types that the AMI supports. You can specify instance type names or use wildcard patterns (for example, `t3.*`).
Constraints: Maximum 100 entries. Each entry must be 1-24 characters and match the pattern `^[A-Za-z0-9_.*-]+$`. Consecutive wildcard characters (`**`) are not allowed. Entries must be unique within each list and across both lists; duplicate entries cause the request to fail.
Type: Array of strings
Array Members: Minimum number of 0 items. Maximum number of 100 items.
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 24.
Required: No
