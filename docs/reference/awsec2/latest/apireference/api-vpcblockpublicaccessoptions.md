# VpcBlockPublicAccessOptions

VPC Block Public Access (BPA) enables you to block resources in VPCs and subnets that you own in a Region from reaching or being reached from the internet through internet gateways and egress-only internet gateways. To learn more about VPC BPA, see [Block public access to VPCs and subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-vpc-bpa.html) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.
