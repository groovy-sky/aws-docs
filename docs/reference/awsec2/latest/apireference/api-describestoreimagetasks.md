# DescribeStoreImageTasks

Describes the progress of the AMI store tasks. You can describe the store tasks for
specified AMIs. If you don't specify the AMIs, you get a paginated list of store tasks from
the last 31 days.

For each AMI task, the response indicates if the task is `InProgress`,
`Completed`, or `Failed`. For tasks `InProgress`, the
response shows the estimated progress as a percentage.

Tasks are listed in reverse chronological order. Currently, only tasks from the past 31
days can be viewed.

To use this API, you must have the required permissions. For more information, see [Permissions for storing and restoring AMIs using S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/work-with-ami-store-restore.html#ami-s3-permissions) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

For more information, see [Store and restore an AMI using\
S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-store-restore.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**DryRun**

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request,
and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is
`DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**Filter.N**

The filters.

- `task-state` \- Returns tasks in a certain state ( `InProgress` \|
`Completed` \| `Failed`)

- `bucket` \- Returns task information for tasks that targeted a specific
bucket. For the filter value, specify the bucket name.

###### Note

When you specify the `ImageIds` parameter, any filters that you specify are
ignored. To use the filters, you must remove the `ImageIds` parameter.

Type: Array of [Filter](api-filter.md) objects

Required: No

**ImageId.N**

The AMI IDs for which to show progress. Up to 20 AMI IDs can be included in a
request.

Type: Array of strings

Required: No

**MaxResults**

The maximum number of items to return for this request.
To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output.
For more information, see [Pagination](query-requests.md#api-pagination).

You cannot specify this parameter and the `ImageIds` parameter in the same
call.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 200.

Required: No
