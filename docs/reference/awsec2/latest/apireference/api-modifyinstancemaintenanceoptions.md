Modifies the recovery behavior of your instance to disable simplified automatic recovery or set the recovery behavior to default. The default configuration will not enable simplified automatic recovery for an unsupported instance type. For more information, see [Simplified automatic recovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-recover.html#instance-configuration-recovery).

Modifies the reboot migration behavior during a user-initiated reboot of an instance that has a pending `system-reboot` event. For more information, see [Enable or disable reboot migration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/schedevents_actions_reboot.html#reboot-migration).

## Request Parameters
<a name="API_ModifyInstanceMaintenanceOptions_RequestParameters"></a>

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](CommonParameters.md).

 **AutoRecovery**
Disables the automatic recovery behavior of your instance or sets it to default.
Type: String
Valid Values: `disabled | default`
Required: No

 **DryRun**
Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.
Type: Boolean
Required: No

 **InstanceId**

Type: String
Required: Yes

 **RebootMigration**
Specifies whether to attempt reboot migration during a user-initiated reboot of an instance that has a scheduled `system-reboot` event:
+  `default` - Amazon EC2 attempts to migrate the instance to new hardware (reboot migration). If successful, the `system-reboot` event is cleared. If unsuccessful, an in-place reboot occurs and the event remains scheduled.
+  `disabled` - Amazon EC2 keeps the instance on the same hardware (in-place reboot). The `system-reboot` event remains scheduled.
This setting only applies to supported instances that have a scheduled reboot event. For more information, see [Enable or disable reboot migration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/schedevents_actions_reboot.html#reboot-migration) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
