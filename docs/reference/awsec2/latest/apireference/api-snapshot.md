# Snapshot

Describes a snapshot.

## Contents

**availabilityZone**

The Availability Zone or Local Zone of the snapshot. For example, `us-west-1a`
(Availability Zone) or `us-west-2-lax-1a` (Local Zone).

Type: String

Required: No

**completionDurationMinutes**

###### Note

Only for snapshot copies created with time-based snapshot copy operations.

The completion duration requested for the time-based snapshot copy operation.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**completionTime**

The time stamp when the snapshot was completed.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**dataEncryptionKeyId**

The data encryption key identifier for the snapshot. This value is a unique identifier
that corresponds to the data encryption key that was used to encrypt the original volume or
snapshot copy. Because data encryption keys are inherited by volumes created from snapshots,
and vice versa, if snapshots share the same data encryption key identifier, then they belong
to the same volume/snapshot lineage. This parameter is only returned by [DescribeSnapshots](api-describesnapshots.md).

Type: String

Required: No

**description**

The description for the snapshot.

Type: String

Required: No

**encrypted**

Indicates whether the snapshot is encrypted.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**fullSnapshotSizeInBytes**

The full size of the snapshot, in bytes.

###### Important

This is **not** the incremental size of the snapshot.
This is the full snapshot size and represents the size of all the blocks that were
written to the source volume at the time the snapshot was created.

Type: Long

Required: No

**kmsKeyId**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS KMS key that was used to protect the
volume encryption key for the parent volume.

Type: String

Required: No

**outpostArn**

The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is stored. For more information, see [Amazon EBS local snapshots on Outposts](../../../../services/ebs/latest/userguide/snapshots-outposts.md) in the
_Amazon EBS User Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**ownerAlias**

The AWS owner alias, from an Amazon-maintained list ( `amazon`). This is not
the user-configured AWS account alias set using the IAM console.

Type: String

Required: No

**ownerId**

The ID of the AWS account that owns the EBS snapshot.

Type: String

Required: No

**progress**

The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage.

Type: String

Required: No

**restoreExpiryTime**

Only for archived snapshots that are temporarily restored. Indicates the date and
time when a temporarily restored snapshot will be automatically re-archived.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**snapshotId**

The ID of the snapshot. Each snapshot receives a unique identifier when it is
created.

Type: String

Required: No

**sseType**

Reserved for future use.

Type: String

Valid Values: `sse-ebs | sse-kms | none`

Required: No

**startTime**

The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**status**

The snapshot state.

Type: String

Valid Values: `pending | completed | error | recoverable | recovering`

Required: No

**statusMessage**

Encrypted Amazon EBS snapshots are copied asynchronously. If a snapshot copy operation fails
(for example, if the proper AWS KMS permissions are not obtained) this field displays error
state details to help you diagnose why the error occurred. This parameter is only returned by
[DescribeSnapshots](api-describesnapshots.md).

Type: String

Required: No

**storageTier**

The storage tier in which the snapshot is stored. `standard` indicates
that the snapshot is stored in the standard snapshot storage tier and that it is ready
for use. `archive` indicates that the snapshot is currently archived and that
it must be restored before it can be used.

Type: String

Valid Values: `archive | standard`

Required: No

**TagSet.N**

Any tags assigned to the snapshot.

Type: Array of [Tag](api-tag.md) objects

Required: No

**transferType**

###### Note

Only for snapshot copies.

Indicates whether the snapshot copy was created with a standard or time-based
snapshot copy operation. Time-based snapshot copy operations complete within the
completion duration specified in the request. Standard snapshot copy operations
are completed on a best-effort basis.

- `standard` \- The snapshot copy was created with a standard
snapshot copy operation.

- `time-based` \- The snapshot copy was created with a time-based
snapshot copy operation.

Type: String

Valid Values: `time-based | standard`

Required: No

**volumeId**

The ID of the volume that was used to create the snapshot. Snapshots created by a copy
snapshot operation have an arbitrary volume ID that you should not use for any purpose.

Type: String

Required: No

**volumeSize**

The size of the volume, in GiB.

Type: Integer

Required: No
