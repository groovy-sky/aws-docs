# RequestSpotInstances

Creates a Spot Instance request.

For more information, see [Work with Spot Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-requests.html) in
the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

###### Important

We strongly discourage using the RequestSpotInstances API because it is a legacy
API with no planned investment. For options for requesting Spot Instances, see
[Which\
is the best Spot request method to use?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-best-practices.html#which-spot-request-method-to-use) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**AvailabilityZoneGroup**

The user-specified name for a logical grouping of requests.

When you specify an Availability Zone group in a Spot Instance request, all Spot
Instances in the request are launched in the same Availability Zone. Instance proximity
is maintained with this parameter, but the choice of Availability Zone is not. The group
applies only to requests for Spot Instances of the same instance type. Any additional
Spot Instance requests that are specified with the same Availability Zone group name are
launched in that same Availability Zone, as long as at least one instance from the group
is still active.

If there is no active instance running in the Availability Zone group that you specify
for a new Spot Instance request (all instances are terminated, the request is expired,
or the maximum price you specified falls below current Spot price), then Amazon EC2 launches
the instance in any Availability Zone where the constraint can be met. Consequently, the
subsequent set of Spot Instances could be placed in a different zone from the original
request, even if you specified the same Availability Zone group.

Default: Instances are launched in any available Availability Zone.

Type: String

Required: No

**BlockDurationMinutes**

Deprecated.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**ClientToken**

Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the
request. For more information, see [Ensuring idempotency in\
Amazon EC2 API requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**DryRun**

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually
making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required
permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is
`UnauthorizedOperation`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**InstanceCount**

The maximum number of Spot Instances to launch.

Default: 1

Type: Integer

Required: No

**InstanceInterruptionBehavior**

The behavior when a Spot Instance is interrupted. The default is `terminate`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `hibernate | stop | terminate`

Required: No

**LaunchGroup**

The instance launch group. Launch groups are Spot Instances that launch together and
terminate together.

Default: Instances are launched and terminated individually

Type: String

Required: No

**LaunchSpecification**

The launch specification.

Type: [RequestSpotLaunchSpecification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotLaunchSpecification.html) object

Required: No

**SpotPrice**

The maximum price per unit hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot Instance. We do not recommend
using this parameter because it can lead to increased interruptions. If you do not specify this parameter, you will pay the current Spot price.

###### Important

If you specify a maximum price, your instances will be interrupted more frequently than if you do not specify this parameter.

Type: String

Required: No

**TagSpecification.N**

The key-value pair for tagging the Spot Instance request on creation. The value for
`ResourceType` must be `spot-instances-request`, otherwise the
Spot Instance request fails. To tag the Spot Instance request after it has been created,
see [CreateTags](api-createtags.md).

Type: Array of [TagSpecification](api-tagspecification.md) objects

Required: No

**Type**

The Spot Instance request type.

Default: `one-time`

Type: String

Valid Values: `one-time | persistent`

Required: No

**ValidFrom**

The start date of the request. If this is a one-time request, the request becomes
active at this date and time and remains active until all instances launch, the request
expires, or the request is canceled. If the request is persistent, the request becomes
active at this date and time and remains active until it expires or is canceled.

The specified start date and time cannot be equal to the current date and time. You
must specify a start date and time that occurs after the current date and time.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**ValidUntil**

The end date of the request, in UTC format
( _YYYY_- _MM_- _DD_ T _HH_: _MM_: _SS_ Z).

- For a persistent request, the request remains active until the
`ValidUntil` date and time is reached. Otherwise, the request
remains active until you cancel it.

- For a one-time request, the request remains active until all instances launch,
the request is canceled, or the `ValidUntil` date and time is
reached. By default, the request is valid for 7 days from the date the request
was created.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

## Response Elements

The following elements are returned by the service.

**requestId**

The ID of the request.

Type: String

**spotInstanceRequestSet**

The Spot Instance requests.

Type: Array of [SpotInstanceRequest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_SpotInstanceRequest.html) objects

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common client error codes](errors-overview.md#CommonErrors).

## Examples

### Example 1

This example creates a one-time Spot Instance request for two instances. It
does not include an Availability Zone or subnet, so Amazon EC2 selects an
Availability Zone for you and launches the instances in the default subnet of
the selected Availability Zone.

#### Sample Request

```

https://ec2.amazonaws.com/?Action=RequestSpotInstances
&InstanceCount=2
&Type=one-time
&LaunchSpecification.ImageId=ami-1a2b3c4d
&LaunchSpecification.KeyName=my-key-pair
&LaunchSpecification.SecurityGroupId.1=sg-1a2b3c4d
&LaunchSpecification.InstanceType=m3.medium
&LaunchSpecification.IamInstanceProfile.Name=s3access
&AUTHPARAMS
```

### Example 2

The following example includes an Availability Zone. Amazon EC2 launches the instances
in the default subnet of the specified Availability Zone.

#### Sample Request

```

https://ec2.amazonaws.com/?Action=RequestSpotInstances
&InstanceCount=2
&Type=one-time
&LaunchSpecification.ImageId=ami-1a2b3c4d
&LaunchSpecification.KeyName=my-key-pair
&LaunchSpecification.SecurityGroupId.1=sg-1a2b3c4d
&LaunchSpecification.InstanceType=m3.medium
&LaunchSpecification.Placement.AvailabilityZone=us-west-2a
&LaunchSpecification.IamInstanceProfile.Name=s3access
&AUTHPARAMS
```

### Example 3

The following example includes a subnet. Amazon EC2 launches the instances in the
specified subnet.

#### Sample Request

```

https://ec2.amazonaws.com/?Action=RequestSpotInstances
&InstanceCount=2
&Type=one-time
&LaunchSpecification.ImageId=ami-1a2b3c4d
&LaunchSpecification.KeyName=my-key-pair
&LaunchSpecification.SecurityGroupId.1=sg-1a2b3c4d
&LaunchSpecification.InstanceType=m3.medium
&LaunchSpecification.SubnetId=subnet-1a2b3c4d
&LaunchSpecification.IamInstanceProfile.Name=s3access
&AUTHPARAMS
```
