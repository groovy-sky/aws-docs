# ModifyIpamPool

Modify the configurations of an IPAM pool.

For more information, see [Modify a pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/mod-pool-ipam.html) in the _Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**AddAllocationResourceTag.N**

Add tag allocation rules to a pool. For more information about allocation rules, see [Create a top-level pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/create-top-ipam.html) in the _Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide_.

Type: Array of [RequestIpamResourceTag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestIpamResourceTag.html) objects

Required: No

**AllocationDefaultNetmaskLength**

The default netmask length for allocations added to this pool. If, for example, the CIDR assigned to this pool is 10.0.0.0/8 and you enter 16 here, new allocations will default to 10.0.0.0/16.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0. Maximum value of 128.

Required: No

**AllocationMaxNetmaskLength**

The maximum netmask length possible for CIDR allocations in this IPAM pool to be compliant. Possible
netmask lengths for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128.The maximum netmask
length must be greater than the minimum netmask length.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0. Maximum value of 128.

Required: No

**AllocationMinNetmaskLength**

The minimum netmask length required for CIDR allocations in this IPAM pool to be compliant. Possible
netmask lengths for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128. The minimum netmask
length must be less than the maximum netmask length.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0. Maximum value of 128.

Required: No

**AutoImport**

If true, IPAM will continuously look for resources within the CIDR range of this pool
and automatically import them as allocations into your IPAM. The CIDRs that will be allocated for
these resources must not already be allocated to other resources in order for the import to succeed. IPAM will import
a CIDR regardless of its compliance with the pool's allocation rules, so a resource might be imported and subsequently
marked as noncompliant. If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs that overlap, IPAM will import the largest CIDR only. If IPAM
discovers multiple CIDRs with matching CIDRs, IPAM will randomly import one of them only.

A locale must be set on the pool for this feature to work.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**ClearAllocationDefaultNetmaskLength**

Clear the default netmask length allocation rule for this pool.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**Description**

The description of the IPAM pool you want to modify.

Type: String

Required: No

**DryRun**

A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action without actually making the request
and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`.
Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**IpamPoolId**

The ID of the IPAM pool you want to modify.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**RemoveAllocationResourceTag.N**

Remove tag allocation rules from a pool.

Type: Array of [RequestIpamResourceTag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestIpamResourceTag.html) objects

Required: No

## Response Elements

The following elements are returned by the service.

**ipamPool**

The results of the modification.

Type: [IpamPool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_IpamPool.html) object

**requestId**

The ID of the request.

Type: String
