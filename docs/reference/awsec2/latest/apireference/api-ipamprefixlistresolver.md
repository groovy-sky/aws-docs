# IpamPrefixListResolver

Describes an IPAM prefix list resolver.

An IPAM prefix list resolver is a component that manages the synchronization between IPAM's CIDR selection rules and customer-managed prefix lists. It automates connectivity configurations by selecting CIDRs from IPAM's database based on your business logic and synchronizing them with prefix lists used in resources such as VPC route tables and security groups.
