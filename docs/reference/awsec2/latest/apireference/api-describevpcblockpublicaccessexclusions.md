# DescribeVpcBlockPublicAccessExclusions

Describe VPC Block Public Access (BPA) exclusions. A VPC BPA exclusion is a mode that can be applied to a single VPC or subnet that exempts it from the account’s BPA mode and will allow bidirectional or egress-only access. You can create BPA exclusions for VPCs and subnets even when BPA is not enabled on the account to ensure that there is no traffic disruption to the exclusions when VPC BPA is turned on. To learn more about VPC BPA, see [Block public access to VPCs and subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-vpc-bpa.html) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**DryRun**

and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`.
Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

**Filter.N**

Filters for the request:

- `resource-arn` \- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a exclusion.

- `internet-gateway-exclusion-mode` \- The mode of a VPC BPA exclusion. Possible values: `allow-bidirectional | allow-egress`.

- `state` \- The state of VPC BPA. Possible values: `create-in-progress | create-complete | update-in-progress | update-complete | delete-in-progress | deleted-complete | disable-in-progress | disable-complete`
