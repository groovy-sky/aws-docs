# Ipv6Range

Describes an IPv6 address range.

## Contents

**CidrIpv6** (request), **cidrIpv6** (response)

The IPv6 address range. You can either specify a CIDR block or a source security group,
not both. To specify a single IPv6 address, use the /128 prefix length.

###### Note

AWS
[canonicalizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonicalization) IPv4 and IPv6 CIDRs. For example, if you specify 100.68.0.18/18 for the CIDR block,
AWS canonicalizes the CIDR block to 100.68.0.0/18. Any subsequent DescribeSecurityGroups and DescribeSecurityGroupRules calls will
return the canonicalized form of the CIDR block. Additionally, if you attempt to add another rule with the
non-canonical form of the CIDR (such as 100.68.0.18/18) and there is already a rule for the canonicalized
form of the CIDR block (such as 100.68.0.0/18), the API throws an duplicate rule error.

Type: String

Required: No

**Description** (request), **description** (response)
