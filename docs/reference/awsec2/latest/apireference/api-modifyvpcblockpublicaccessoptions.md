# ModifyVpcBlockPublicAccessOptions

Modify VPC Block Public Access (BPA) options. VPC Block Public Access (BPA) enables you to block resources in VPCs and subnets that you own in a Region from reaching or being reached from the internet through internet gateways and egress-only internet gateways. To learn more about VPC BPA, see [Block public access to VPCs and subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-vpc-bpa.html) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**DryRun**

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request,
and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`.
Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**InternetGatewayBlockMode**

The mode of VPC BPA.

- `off`: VPC BPA is not enabled and traffic is allowed to and from internet gateways and egress-only internet gateways in this Region.

- `block-bidirectional`: Block all traffic to and from internet gateways and egress-only internet gateways in this Region (except for excluded VPCs and subnets).

- `block-ingress`: Block all internet traffic to the VPCs in this Region (except for VPCs or subnets which are excluded). Only traffic to and from NAT gateways and egress-only internet gateways is allowed because these gateways only allow outbound connections to be established.

Type: String

Valid Values: `off | block-bidirectional | block-ingress`

Required: Yes
