# DisableIpamPolicy

Disables an IPAM policy.

An IPAM policy is a set of rules that define how public IPv4 addresses from IPAM pools are allocated to AWS resources. Each rule maps an AWS service to IPAM pools that the service will use to get IP addresses. A single policy can have multiple rules and be applied to multiple AWS Regions. If the IPAM pool run out of addresses then the services fallback to Amazon-provided IP addresses. A policy can be applied to an individual AWS account or an entity within AWS Organizations.
