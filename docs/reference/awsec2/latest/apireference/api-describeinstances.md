# DescribeInstances

Describes the specified instances or all instances.

If you specify instance IDs, the output includes information for only the specified
instances. If you specify filters, the output includes information for only those
instances that meet the filter criteria. If you do not specify instance IDs or filters,
the output includes information for all instances, which can affect performance. We
recommend that you use pagination to ensure that the operation returns quickly and
successfully.

The response includes SQL license exemption status information for instances registered
with the SQL LE service, providing visibility into license exemption configuration and status.

If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, an error is returned. If you specify
an instance that you do not own, it is not included in the output.

Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is
usually less than one hour.

If you describe instances in the rare case where an Availability Zone is experiencing
a service disruption and you specify instance IDs that are in the affected zone, or do
not specify any instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you describe instances and
specify only instance IDs that are in an unaffected zone, the call works
normally.

The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model. This means that the result of an
API command you run that creates or modifies resources might not be immediately
available to all subsequent commands you run. For guidance on how to manage eventual
consistency, see [Eventual consistency in the\
Amazon EC2 API](../../../../services/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.md) in the _Amazon EC2 Developer_
_Guide_.

###### Important

We strongly recommend using only paginated requests. Unpaginated requests are
susceptible to throttling and timeouts.

###### Note

The order of the elements in the response, including those within nested
structures, might vary. Applications should not assume the elements appear in a
particular order.
