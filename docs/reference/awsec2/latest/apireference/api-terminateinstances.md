# TerminateInstances

Terminates (deletes) the specified instances. This operation is [idempotent](../../../../services/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.md); if you
terminate an instance more than once, each call succeeds.

###### Important

**Terminating an instance is permanent and irreversible.**

After you terminate an instance, you can no longer connect to it, and it can't be recovered.
All attached Amazon EBS volumes that are configured to be deleted on termination are also permanently
deleted and can't be recovered. All data stored on instance store volumes is permanently lost.
For more information, see [How instance termination works](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/how-ec2-instance-termination-works.md).

Before you terminate an instance, ensure that you have backed up all data that you need to
retain after the termination to persistent storage.

If you specify multiple instances and the request fails (for example, because of a
single incorrect instance ID), none of the instances are terminated.

If you terminate multiple instances across multiple Availability Zones, and one or
more of the specified instances are enabled for termination protection, the request
fails with the following results:

- The specified instances that are in the same Availability Zone as the
protected instance are not terminated.

- The specified instances that are in different Availability Zones, where no
other specified instances are protected, are successfully terminated.

For example, say you have the following instances:

- Instance A: `us-east-1a`; Not protected

- Instance B: `us-east-1a`; Not protected

- Instance C: `us-east-1b`; Protected

- Instance D: `us-east-1b`; not protected

If you attempt to terminate all of these instances in the same request, the request
reports failure with the following results:

- Instance A and Instance B are successfully terminated because none of the
specified instances in `us-east-1a` are enabled for termination
protection.

- Instance C and Instance D fail to terminate because at least one of the
specified instances in `us-east-1b` (Instance C) is enabled for
termination protection.

Terminated instances remain visible after termination (for approximately one
hour).

By default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when the instance
launched. Volumes attached after instance launch continue running.

By default, the TerminateInstances operation includes a graceful operating system (OS)
shutdown. To bypass the graceful shutdown, use the `skipOsShutdown`
parameter; however, this might risk data integrity.

You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only terminate
instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance differs if you stop or
terminate it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other
devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, any attached
EBS volumes with the `DeleteOnTermination` block device mapping parameter set
to `true` are automatically deleted. For more information about the
differences between stopping and terminating instances, see [Amazon EC2\
instance state changes](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

When you terminate an instance, we attempt to terminate it forcibly after a short
while. If your instance appears stuck in the shutting-down state after a period of time,
there might be an issue with the underlying host computer. For more information about
terminating and troubleshooting terminating your instances, see [Terminate Amazon EC2 instances](../../../../general/index.md) and
[Troubleshooting terminating your instance](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/troubleshootinginstancesshuttingdown.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**DryRun**

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the operation, without actually making the
request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is
`DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**Force**

Forces the instances to terminate. The instance will first attempt a graceful
shutdown, which includes flushing file system caches and metadata. If the graceful
shutdown fails to complete within the timeout period, the instance shuts down forcibly
without flushing the file system caches and metadata.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**InstanceId.N**

The IDs of the instances.

Constraints: Up to 1000 instance IDs. We recommend breaking up this request into
smaller batches.

Type: Array of strings

Required: Yes

**SkipOsShutdown**

Specifies whether to bypass the graceful OS shutdown process when the instance is
terminated.

Default: `false`

Type: Boolean

Required: No

## Response Elements

The following elements are returned by the service.

**instancesSet**

Information about the terminated instances.

Type: Array of [InstanceStateChange](api-instancestatechange.md) objects

**requestId**

The ID of the request.

Type: String

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common client error codes](errors-overview.md#CommonErrors).
