 ** code **
The reason code for the application status check result. Possible values:
+  `ResponseCodeMatched` – The HTTP status code returned by the health check matched the configured `StatusCodeMatcher`.
+  `ResponseCodeMismatch` – The HTTP status code returned by the health check did not match the configured `StatusCodeMatcher`.
+  `ConnectionTimeout` – The connection to the target timed out.
+  `ResponseTimeout` – The health check timed out while waiting for a response from the target.
+  `ConnectionRefused` – The target refused the health check connection.
+  `ConnectionReset` – The target reset the health check connection before returning a response.
Current health check results use the values in the preceding list. Legacy results that do not contain structured reason metadata can instead contain a producer error type, such as `Http Status Code` or `HttpConnectTimeoutException`.
For `ResponseCodeMatched` and `ResponseCodeMismatch`, the `statusCode` field contains the returned HTTP status code. The `protocol` field contains the protocol used for the health check.
