# ModifyClientVpnEndpoint

Modifies the specified Client VPN endpoint. Modifying the DNS server resets existing client connections.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**ClientConnectOptions**

The options for managing connection authorization for new client connections.

Type: [ClientConnectOptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ClientConnectOptions.html) object

AWS provided clients when a VPN session is established.

Type: [ClientLoginBannerOptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ClientLoginBannerOptions.html) object

**ClientRouteEnforcementOptions**

Client route enforcement is a feature of the Client VPN service that helps enforce administrator defined routes on devices connected through the VPN. T
his feature helps improve your security posture by ensuring that network traffic originating from a connected client is not inadvertently sent outside the VPN tunnel.

Client route enforcement works by monitoring the route table of a connected device for routing policy changes to the VPN connection. If the feature detects any VPN routing policy modifications, it will automatically force an update to the route table,
reverting it back to the expected route configurations.

Required: No

**ClientVpnEndpointId**

The ID of the Client VPN endpoint to modify.

Type: String
