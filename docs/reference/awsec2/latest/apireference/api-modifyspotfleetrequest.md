# ModifySpotFleetRequest

Modifies the specified Spot Fleet request.

You can only modify a Spot Fleet request of type `maintain`.

While the Spot Fleet request is being modified, it is in the `modifying`
state.

To scale up your Spot Fleet, increase its target capacity. The Spot Fleet launches the
additional Spot Instances according to the allocation strategy for the Spot Fleet
request. If the allocation strategy is `lowestPrice`, the Spot Fleet launches
instances using the Spot Instance pool with the lowest price. If the allocation strategy
is `diversified`, the Spot Fleet distributes the instances across the Spot
Instance pools. If the allocation strategy is `capacityOptimized`, Spot Fleet
launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances
that are launching.

To scale down your Spot Fleet, decrease its target capacity. First, the Spot Fleet
cancels any open requests that exceed the new target capacity. You can request that the
Spot Fleet terminate Spot Instances until the size of the fleet no longer exceeds the
new target capacity. If the allocation strategy is `lowestPrice`, the Spot
Fleet terminates the instances with the highest price per unit. If the allocation
strategy is `capacityOptimized`, the Spot Fleet terminates the instances in
the Spot Instance pools that have the least available Spot Instance capacity. If the allocation
strategy is `diversified`, the Spot Fleet terminates instances across the
Spot Instance pools. Alternatively, you can request that the Spot Fleet keep the fleet
at its current size, but not replace any Spot Instances that are interrupted or that you
terminate manually.

If you are finished with your Spot Fleet for now, but will use it again later, you can
set the target capacity to 0.

## Request Parameters

The following parameters are for this specific action. For more information about required and optional parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Query Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**Context**

Reserved.

Type: String

Required: No

**ExcessCapacityTerminationPolicy**

Indicates whether running instances should be terminated if the target capacity
of the Spot Fleet request is decreased below the current size of the Spot Fleet.

Supported only for fleets of type `maintain`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `noTermination | default`

Required: No

**LaunchTemplateConfig.N**

The launch template and overrides. You can only use this parameter if you specified a
launch template ( `LaunchTemplateConfigs`) in your Spot Fleet request. If you
specified `LaunchSpecifications` in your Spot Fleet request, then omit this
parameter.

Type: Array of [LaunchTemplateConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_LaunchTemplateConfig.html) objects

Required: No

**OnDemandTargetCapacity**

The number of On-Demand Instances in the fleet.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**SpotFleetRequestId**

The ID of the Spot Fleet request.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**TargetCapacity**

The size of the fleet.

Type: Integer

Required: No

## Response Elements

The following elements are returned by the service.

**requestId**

The ID of the request.

Type: String

**return**

If the request succeeds, the response returns `true`. If the request fails,
no response is returned, and instead an error message is returned.

Type: Boolean
