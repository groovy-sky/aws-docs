# FleetData

Describes an EC2 Fleet.

## Contents

**activityStatus**

The progress of the EC2 Fleet.

For fleets of type `instant`, the status is `fulfilled` after all
requests are placed, regardless of whether target capacity is met (this is the only
possible status for `instant` fleets).

For fleets of type `request` or `maintain`, the status is
`pending_fulfillment` after all requests are placed, `fulfilled`
when the fleet size meets or exceeds target capacity, `pending_termination`
while instances are terminating when fleet size is decreased, and `error` if
there's an error.

Type: String

Valid Values: `error | pending_fulfillment | pending_termination | fulfilled`

Required: No

**clientToken**

Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the
request. For more information, see [Ensuring\
idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html).

Constraints: Maximum 64 ASCII characters

Type: String

Required: No

**context**

Reserved.

Type: String

Required: No

**createTime**

The creation date and time of the EC2 Fleet.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**ErrorSet.N**

Information about the instances that could not be launched by the fleet. Valid only when
**Type** is set to `instant`.

Type: Array of [DescribeFleetError](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeFleetError.html) objects

Required: No

**excessCapacityTerminationPolicy**

Indicates whether running instances should be terminated if the target capacity of the
EC2 Fleet is decreased below the current size of the EC2 Fleet.

Supported only for fleets of type `maintain`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `no-termination | termination`

Required: No

**fleetId**

The ID of the EC2 Fleet.

Type: String

Required: No

**FleetInstanceSet.N**

Information about the instances that were launched by the fleet. Valid only when
**Type** is set to `instant`.

Type: Array of [DescribeFleetsInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeFleetsInstances.html) objects

Required: No

**fleetState**

The state of the EC2 Fleet.

Type: String

Valid Values: `submitted | active | deleted | failed | deleted_running | deleted_terminating | modifying`

Required: No

**fulfilledCapacity**

The number of units fulfilled by this request compared to the set target
capacity.

Type: Double

Required: No

**fulfilledOnDemandCapacity**

The number of units fulfilled by this request compared to the set target On-Demand
capacity.

Type: Double

Required: No

**LaunchTemplateConfigs.N**

The launch template and overrides.

Type: Array of [FleetLaunchTemplateConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_FleetLaunchTemplateConfig.html) objects

Required: No

**onDemandOptions**

The allocation strategy of On-Demand Instances in an EC2 Fleet.

Type: [OnDemandOptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_OnDemandOptions.html) object

Required: No

**replaceUnhealthyInstances**

Indicates whether EC2 Fleet should replace unhealthy Spot Instances. Supported only for
fleets of type `maintain`. For more information, see [EC2 Fleet\
health checks](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/manage-ec2-fleet.md#ec2-fleet-health-checks) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**reservedCapacityOptions**

Defines EC2 Fleet preferences for utilizing reserved capacity when DefaultTargetCapacityType is set to `reserved-capacity`.

Type: [ReservedCapacityOptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ReservedCapacityOptions.html) object

Required: No

**spotOptions**

The configuration of Spot Instances in an EC2 Fleet.

Type: [SpotOptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_SpotOptions.html) object

Required: No

**TagSet.N**

The tags for an EC2 Fleet resource.

Type: Array of [Tag](api-tag.md) objects

Required: No

**targetCapacitySpecification**

The number of units to request. You can choose to set the target capacity in terms of
instances or a performance characteristic that is important to your application workload,
such as vCPUs, memory, or I/O. If the request type is `maintain`, you can
specify a target capacity of 0 and add capacity later.

Type: [TargetCapacitySpecification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_TargetCapacitySpecification.html) object

Required: No

**terminateInstancesWithExpiration**

Indicates whether running instances should be terminated when the EC2 Fleet expires.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**type**

The type of request. Indicates whether the EC2 Fleet only `requests` the target
capacity, or also attempts to `maintain` it. If you request a certain target
capacity, EC2 Fleet only places the required requests; it does not attempt to replenish
instances if capacity is diminished, and it does not submit requests in alternative
capacity pools if capacity is unavailable. To maintain a certain target capacity, EC2 Fleet
places the required requests to meet this target capacity. It also automatically
replenishes any interrupted Spot Instances. Default: `maintain`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `request | maintain | instant`

Required: No

**validFrom**

The start date and time of the request, in UTC format (for example,
_YYYY_- _MM_- _DD_ T _HH_: _MM_: _SS_ Z).
The default is to start fulfilling the request immediately.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**validUntil**

The end date and time of the request, in UTC format (for example,
_YYYY_- _MM_- _DD_ T _HH_: _MM_: _SS_ Z).
At this point, no new instance requests are placed or able to fulfill the request. The
default end date is 7 days from the current date.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No
