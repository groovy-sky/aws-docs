# DisableSnapshotBlockPublicAccess

Disables the _block public access for snapshots_ setting at
the account level for the specified AWS Region. After you disable block public
access for snapshots in a Region, users can publicly share snapshots in that Region.

###### Important

Enabling block public access for snapshots in _block-all-sharing_
mode does not change the permissions for snapshots that are already publicly shared.
Instead, it prevents these snapshots from be publicly visible and publicly accessible.
Therefore, the attributes for these snapshots still indicate that they are publicly
shared, even though they are not publicly available.

If you disable block public access , these snapshots will become publicly available
again.

For more information, see [Block public access for snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/block-public-access-snapshots.html) in the _Amazon EBS User Guide_ .
