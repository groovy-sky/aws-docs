# ModifyVpnConnection
<a name="API_ModifyVpnConnection"></a>

Modifies the customer gateway or the target gateway of an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. To modify the target gateway, the following migration options are available:
+ An existing virtual private gateway to a new virtual private gateway
+ An existing virtual private gateway to a transit gateway
+ An existing transit gateway to a new transit gateway
+ An existing transit gateway to a virtual private gateway

Before you perform the migration to the new gateway, you must configure the new gateway. Use [CreateVpnGateway](API_CreateVpnGateway.md) to create a virtual private gateway, or [CreateTransitGateway](API_CreateTransitGateway.md) to create a transit gateway.

This step is required when you migrate from a virtual private gateway with static routes to a transit gateway.

You must delete the static routes before you migrate to the new gateway.

Keep a copy of the static route before you delete it. You will need to add back these routes to the transit gateway after the VPN connection migration is complete.

After you migrate to the new gateway, you might need to modify your VPC route table. Use [CreateRoute](API_CreateRoute.md) and [DeleteRoute](API_DeleteRoute.md) to make the changes described in [Update VPC route tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/modify-vpn-target.html#step-update-routing) in the * AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide*.

When the new gateway is a transit gateway, modify the transit gateway route table to allow traffic between the VPC and the AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. Use [CreateTransitGatewayRoute](API_CreateTransitGatewayRoute.md) to add the routes.

 If you deleted VPN static routes, you must add the static routes to the transit gateway route table.

After you perform this operation, the VPN endpoint's IP addresses on the AWS side and the tunnel options remain intact. Your AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection will be temporarily unavailable for a brief period while we provision the new endpoints.
