# CancelSpotFleetRequests

Cancels the specified Spot Fleet requests.

After you cancel a Spot Fleet request, the Spot Fleet launches no new instances.

You must also specify whether a canceled Spot Fleet request should terminate its instances. If you
choose to terminate the instances, the Spot Fleet request enters the
`cancelled_terminating` state. Otherwise, the Spot Fleet request enters
the `cancelled_running` state and the instances continue to run until they
are interrupted or you terminate them manually.

###### Important

**Terminating an instance is permanent and irreversible.**

After you terminate an instance, you can no longer connect to it, and it can't be recovered.
All attached Amazon EBS volumes that are configured to be deleted on termination are also permanently
deleted and can't be recovered. All data stored on instance store volumes is permanently lost.
For more information, see [How instance termination works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/how-ec2-instance-termination-works.html).

Before you terminate an instance, ensure that you have backed up all data that you need to
retain after the termination to persistent storage.

###### Restrictions

- You can delete up to 100 fleets in a single request. If you exceed the specified
number, no fleets are deleted.
