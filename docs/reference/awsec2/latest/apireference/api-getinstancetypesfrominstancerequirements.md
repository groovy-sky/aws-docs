# GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements

Returns a list of instance types with the specified instance attributes. You can
use the response to preview the instance types without launching instances. Note
that the response does not consider capacity.

When you specify multiple parameters, you get instance types that satisfy all of the
specified parameters. If you specify multiple values for a parameter, you get instance
types that satisfy any of the specified values.

For more information, see [Preview instance types with specified attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-attribute-based-instance-type-selection.html#ec2fleet-get-instance-types-from-instance-requirements), [Specify attributes for instance type selection for EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-attribute-based-instance-type-selection.html), and [Spot\
placement score](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/spot-placement-score.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_, and [Creating\
mixed instance groups using attribute-based instance type selection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-asg-instance-type-requirements.html) in the
_Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.
