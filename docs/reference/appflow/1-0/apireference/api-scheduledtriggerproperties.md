Specifies the configuration details of a schedule-triggered flow as defined by the user.
Currently, these settings only apply to the `Scheduled` trigger type.

## Contents

**scheduleExpression**

The scheduling expression that determines the rate at which the schedule will run, for
example `rate(5minutes)`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.

Pattern: `.*`

**dataPullMode**

Specifies whether a scheduled flow has an incremental data transfer or a complete data
transfer for each flow run.

Type: String

Valid Values: `Incremental | Complete`

Required: No

**firstExecutionFrom**

Specifies the date range for the records to import from the connector in the first flow
run.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**flowErrorDeactivationThreshold**

Defines how many times a scheduled flow fails consecutively before Amazon AppFlow
deactivates it.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 100.

Required: No

**scheduleEndTime**

The time at which the scheduled flow ends. The time is formatted as a timestamp that
follows the ISO 8601 standard, such as `2022-04-27T13:00:00-07:00`.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**scheduleOffset**

Specifies the optional offset that is added to the time interval for a schedule-triggered

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**timezone**

Specifies the time zone used when referring to the dates and times of a scheduled flow,
such as `America/New_York`. This time zone is only a descriptive label. It doesn't
affect how Amazon AppFlow interprets the timestamps that you specify to schedule the
flow.

If you want to schedule a flow by using times in a particular time zone, indicate the time
zone as a UTC offset in your timestamps. For example, the UTC offsets for the
`America/New_York` timezone are `-04:00` EDT and `-05:00
        EST`.
