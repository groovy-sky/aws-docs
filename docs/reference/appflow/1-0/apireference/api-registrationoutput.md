# RegistrationOutput
<a name="API_RegistrationOutput"></a>

Describes the status of an attempt from Amazon AppFlow to register a resource.

When you run a flow that you've configured to use a metadata catalog, Amazon AppFlow registers a metadata table and data partitions with that catalog. This operation provides the status of that registration attempt. The operation also indicates how many related resources Amazon AppFlow created or updated.
