**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Using the AWS SDK for Java with Amazon Glacier

The AWS SDK for Java provides both high-level and low-level APIs for Amazon Glacier (Amazon Glacier) as described in
[Using the AWS SDKs with Amazon Glacier](using-aws-sdk.md). For information about
downloading the AWS SDK for Java, see [Amazon SDK for\
Java](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava).

###### Note

The AWS SDK for Java provides thread-safe clients for accessing Amazon Glacier. As a best practice,
your applications should create one client and reuse the client between threads.

- [Using the High-Level API](#about-high-level-java-api)

- [Running Java Examples for Amazon Glacier Using Eclipse](#setting-up-and-testing-sdk-java)

- [Setting the Endpoint](#setting-sdk-java-endpoint)

## Using the Low-Level API

The low-level `AmazonGlacierClient` class provides all the methods that
map to the underlying REST operations of Amazon Glacier ( [API Reference for Amazon Glacier](../../../../services/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-api.md)). When calling any
of these methods, you must create a corresponding request object and provide a response
object in which the method can return the Amazon Glacier response to the operation.

For example, the `AmazonGlacierClient` class provides the
`createVault` method to create a vault. This method maps to the
underlying Create Vault REST operation (see [Create Vault (PUT vault)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-vault-put.html)). To use this method, you must create instances of
the `CreateVaultResult` object that receives the Amazon Glacier response as shown in
the following Java code snippet:

```

AmazonGlacierClient client = new AmazonGlacierClient(credentials);
client.setEndpoint("https://glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/");

CreateVaultRequest request = new CreateVaultRequest()
    .withAccountId("-")
    .withVaultName(vaultName);
CreateVaultResult result = client.createVault(createVaultRequest);
```

All the low-level samples in the guide use this pattern.

###### Note

The preceding code segment specifies `AccountID` when creating
the request. However, when using the AWS SDK for Java, the
`AccountId` in the request is optional, and therefore all the
low-level examples in this guide don't set this value. The
`AccountId` is the AWS account ID. This value must match the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. You can
specify either the AWS account ID or optionally a '-', in which case Amazon Glacier
uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the
request. If you specify your Account ID, do not include hyphens in it. When
using AWS SDK for Java, if you don't provide the account ID, the library sets
the account ID to '-'.

## Using the High-Level API

To further simplify your application development, the AWS SDK for Java provides
the `ArchiveTransferManager` class that implements a higher-level abstraction
for the some of the methods in the low-level API. It provides useful methods, such as
the `upload` and `download` methods for archive operations.

For example, the following Java code snippet uses the `upload`
high-level method to upload an archive.

```

String vaultName = "examplevault";
String archiveToUpload = "c:/folder/exampleArchive.zip";

ArchiveTransferManager atm = new ArchiveTransferManager(client, credentials);
String archiveId = atm.upload(vaultName, "Tax 2012 documents", new File(archiveToUpload)).getArchiveId();
```

Note that any operations you perform apply to the AWS Region you specified when
creating the `ArchiveTransferManager` object. If you don't specify any
AWS Region, the AWS SDK for Java sets `us-east-1` as the
default AWS Region.

All the high-level examples in this guide use this pattern.

###### Note

The high-level `ArchiveTransferManager` class can be
constructed with an `AmazonGlacierClient` instance or an
`AWSCredentials` instance.

## Running Java Examples for Amazon Glacier Using Eclipse

The easiest way to get started with the Java code examples is to install the
latest AWS Toolkit for Eclipse. For information on installing or updating to the latest toolkit, go to
[http://aws.amazon.com/eclipse](http://aws.amazon.com/eclipse). The
following tasks guide you through the creation and testing of the Java code examples
provided in this section.

General Process of Creating Java Code Examples

1

Create a default credentials profile for your AWS credentials as described in the AWS SDK for Java topic
[Providing AWS Credentials in the Amazon SDK for Java](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html).

2

Create a new AWS Java project in Eclipse. The project is pre-configured with the AWS SDK for Java.

3

Copy the code from the section you are reading to your project.

4

Update the code by providing any required data. For example, if uploading a file,
provide the file path and the bucket name.

5

Run the code. Verify that the object is created by using the AWS Management Console. For more
information about the AWS Management Console, go to [http://aws.amazon.com/console/](http://aws.amazon.com/console).

## Setting the Endpoint

By default, the AWS SDK for Java uses the endpoint
`https://glacier.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`. You can set the endpoint
explicitly as shown in the following Java code snippets.

The following snippet shows how to set the endpoint to the US West (Oregon) Region
( `us-west-2`) in the low-level API.

###### Example

```

client = new AmazonGlacierClient(credentials);
client.setEndpoint("glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com");
```

The following snippet shows how to set the endpoint to the US West (Oregon) Region in
the high-level API.

```

glacierClient = new AmazonGlacierClient(credentials);
sqsClient = new AmazonSQSClient(credentials);
snsClient = new AmazonSNSClient(credentials);

glacierClient.setEndpoint("glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com");
sqsClient.setEndpoint("sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com");
snsClient.setEndpoint("sns.us-west-2.amazonaws.com");

ArchiveTransferManager atm = new ArchiveTransferManager(glacierClient, sqsClient, snsClient);
```

For a list of supported AWS Regions and endpoints, see [Accessing Amazon Glacier](../../../../services/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-accessing.md).
