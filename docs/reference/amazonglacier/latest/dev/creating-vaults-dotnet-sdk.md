**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Creating a Vault in Amazon Glacier Using the AWS SDK for .NET

Both the [high-level and low-level APIs](using-aws-sdk.md) provided by the Amazon SDK for .NET provide a method to create a vault.

- [Creating a Vault Using the Low-Level API of the AWS SDK for .NET](#create-vault-dotnet-lowlevel)

## Creating a Vault Using the High-Level API of the AWS SDK for .NET

The `ArchiveTransferManager` class of the high-level API provides the
`CreateVault` method you can use to create a vault in an AWS
Region.

### Example: Vault Operations Using the High-Level API of the AWS SDK for .NET

The following C# code example creates and delete a vault in the US West (Oregon) Region. For a list of AWS Regions in which you can create vaults, see
[Accessing Amazon Glacier](../../../../services/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-accessing.md).

For step-by-step instructions on how to run the following example, see [Running Code Examples](using-aws-sdk-for-dot-net.md#setting-up-and-testing-sdk-dotnet). You need to update the code as shown with a vault name.

###### Example

```

using System;
using Amazon.Glacier;
using Amazon.Glacier.Transfer;
using Amazon.Runtime;

namespace glacier.amazon.com.docsamples
{
  class VaultCreateDescribeListVaultsDeleteHighLevel
  {
    static string vaultName = "*** Provide vault name ***";

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      try
      {
          var manager = new ArchiveTransferManager(Amazon.RegionEndpoint.USWest2);
          manager.CreateVault(vaultName);
          Console.WriteLine("Vault created. To delete the vault, press Enter");
          Console.ReadKey();
          manager.DeleteVault(vaultName);
          Console.WriteLine("\nVault deleted. To continue, press Enter");
          Console.ReadKey();
      }
      catch (AmazonGlacierException e) { Console.WriteLine(e.Message); }
      catch (AmazonServiceException e) { Console.WriteLine(e.Message); }
      catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine(e.Message); }
      Console.WriteLine("To continue, press Enter");
      Console.ReadKey();
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating a Vault Using the Low-Level API of the AWS SDK for .NET

The low-level API provides methods for all the vault operations, including create and
delete vaults, get a vault description, and get a list of vaults created in a specific AWS Region. The following are the steps to create a vault using the AWS SDK for .NET.

1. Create an instance of the `AmazonGlacierClient` class (the client).

You need to specify an AWS Region in which you want to create a vault.
    All operations you perform using this client apply to that AWS Region.

2. Provide request information by creating an instance of the `CreateVaultRequest`
    class.

    Amazon Glacier (Amazon Glacier) requires you to provide a vault name and your account ID. If
    you don't provide an account ID, then account ID associated with the
    credentials you provide to sign the request is assumed. For more
    information, see [Using the AWS SDK for .NET with Amazon Glacier](using-aws-sdk-for-dot-net.md).

3. Run the `CreateVault` method by providing the request object as a
    parameter.

The response Amazon Glacier returns is available in the
    `CreateVaultResponse` object.

### Example: Vault Operations Using the Low-Level API of the AWS SDK for .NET

The following C# example illustrates the preceding steps. The example creates a vault in the US West (Oregon) Region. In addition, the code example
retrieves the vault information, lists all vaults in the same AWS Region, and then deletes the vault created. The `Location`
printed is the relative URI of the vault that includes your account ID, the AWS Region, and the vault name.

###### Note

For information about the underlying REST API, see [Create Vault (PUT vault)](../../../../services/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-vault-put.md).

For step-by-step instructions on how to run the following example, see [Running Code Examples](using-aws-sdk-for-dot-net.md#setting-up-and-testing-sdk-dotnet). You need to
update the code as shown with a vault name.
