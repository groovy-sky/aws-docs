# Generate SDKs for REST APIs in API Gateway

To call your REST API in a platform- or language-specific way, you must generate the platform- or
language-specific SDK of the API. You generate your SDK after you create, test, and deploy your API to a
stage. Currently, API Gateway supports generating an SDK for an API in Java, JavaScript, Java for Android, Objective-C or
Swift for iOS, and Ruby.

This section explains how to generate an SDK of an API Gateway API. It also demonstrates how to
use the generated SDK in a Java app, a Java for Android app, Objective-C and Swift for iOS
apps, and a JavaScript app.

To facilitate the discussion, we use this API Gateway [API](../../../../services/apigateway/latest/developerguide/simple-calc-lambda-api.md), which exposes this [Simple Calculator](../../../../services/apigateway/latest/developerguide/simple-calc-nodejs-lambda-function.md) Lambda function.

Before proceeding, create or import the API and deploy it at least once in API Gateway. For
instructions, see [Deploy REST APIs in API Gateway](../../../../services/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-deploy-api.md).
