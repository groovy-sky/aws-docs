## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[HealthCheckId](#API_UpdateHealthCheck_RequestSyntax)**

The ID for the health check for which you want detailed information. When you created
the health check, `CreateHealthCheck` returned the ID in the response, in the
`HealthCheckId` element.

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 64.

Required: Yes

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in XML format.

**[UpdateHealthCheckRequest](#API_UpdateHealthCheck_RequestSyntax)**

Root level tag for the UpdateHealthCheckRequest parameters.

Required: Yes

**[AlarmIdentifier](#API_UpdateHealthCheck_RequestSyntax)**

A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53
health checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is
healthy.

Type: [AlarmIdentifier](api-alarmidentifier.md) object

Required: No

**[ChildHealthChecks](#API_UpdateHealthCheck_RequestSyntax)**

A complex type that contains one `ChildHealthCheck` element for each health
check that you want to associate with a `CALCULATED` health check.

Type: Array of strings

Array Members: Maximum number of 256 items.

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 64.

Required: No

**[Disabled](#API_UpdateHealthCheck_RequestSyntax)**

Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's
what happens:

- **Health checks that check the health of**
**endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting requests to your
application, server, or other resource.

- **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops
aggregating the status of the referenced health checks.

- **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:**
Route 53 stops monitoring the corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to
always be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic
to the corresponding resources. Additionally, in disabled state, you can also invert the
status of the health check to route traffic differently. For more information, see
[Inverted](api-updatehealthcheck-route53-updatehealthcheck-request-inverted.md).

Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
information, see [Amazon Route 53\
Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing).

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[EnableSNI](#API_UpdateHealthCheck_RequestSyntax)**

Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of
`FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the
`client_hello` message during `TLS` negotiation. This allows
the endpoint to respond to `HTTPS` health check requests with the applicable
SSL/TLS certificate.

Some endpoints require that HTTPS requests include the host name in the
`client_hello` message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health
check will be SSL alert `handshake_failure`. A health check can also have
that status for other reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the error,
check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is
valid.

The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the `Common
				Name` field and possibly several more in the `Subject Alternative
				Names` field. One of the domain names in the certificate should match the
value that you specify for `FullyQualifiedDomainName`. If the endpoint
responds to the `client_hello` message with a certificate that does not
include the domain name that you specified in `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, a
health checker will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health checker will
omit `FullyQualifiedDomainName` from the `client_hello`
message.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[FailureThreshold](#API_UpdateHealthCheck_RequestSyntax)**

The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon
Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice
versa. For more information, see [How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy](../../../../services/route53/latest/developerguide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.md) in the
_Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_.

Otherwise, if you don't specify a value for `FailureThreshold`, the default value is
three health checks.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 10.

Required: No

**[FullyQualifiedDomainName](#API_UpdateHealthCheck_RequestSyntax)**

Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for
`IPAddress`.

###### Note

If a health check already has a value for `IPAddress`, you can change
the value. However, you can't update an existing health check to add or remove the
value of `IPAddress`.

**If you specify a value for** `IPAddress`:

Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes
the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header for
all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS
name of the endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.

When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the
`Host` header:

- If you specify a value of `80` for `Port` and
`HTTP` or `HTTP_STR_MATCH` for `Type`,
Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the
endpoint in the `Host` header.

- If you specify a value of `443` for `Port` and
`HTTPS` or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` for `Type`,
Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the
endpoint in the `Host` header.

- If you specify another value for `Port` and any value except
`TCP` for `Type`, Route 53 passes
_`FullyQualifiedDomainName`: `Port`_
to the endpoint in the `Host` header.

If you don't specify a value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, Route 53
substitutes the value of `IPAddress` in the `Host` header in each
of the above cases.

**If you don't specify a value for** `IPAddress`:

If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`, Route 53 sends a DNS request
to the domain that you specify in `FullyQualifiedDomainName` at the interval
you specify in `RequestInterval`. Using an IPv4 address that is returned by
DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`, you can’t update the health check to remove the `FullyQualifiedDomainName`; if you don’t specify a value for `IPAddress` on creation, a
`FullyQualifiedDomainName` is required.

###### Note

If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`, Route 53 uses only IPv4
to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type
of A for the name that you specify for `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, the
health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.

If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets
and you choose to specify the endpoint only by `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, we
recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create
a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the
value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, specify the domain name of the server
(such as `us-east-2-www.example.com`), not the name of the resource record
sets (www.example.com).

###### Important

In this configuration, if the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName`
matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate the health check
with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.

In addition, if the value of `Type` is `HTTP`,
`HTTPS`, `HTTP_STR_MATCH`, or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH`,
Route 53 passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the
`Host` header, as it does when you specify a value for
`IPAddress`. If the value of `Type` is `TCP`, Route
53 doesn't pass a `Host` header.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 255.

Required: No

**[HealthCheckVersion](#API_UpdateHealthCheck_RequestSyntax)**

A sequential counter that Amazon Route 53 sets to `1` when you create a
health check and increments by 1 each time you update settings for the health
check.

We recommend that you use `GetHealthCheck` or `ListHealthChecks`
to get the current value of `HealthCheckVersion` for the health check that
you want to update, and that you include that value in your
`UpdateHealthCheck` request. This prevents Route 53 from overwriting an
intervening update:

- If the value in the `UpdateHealthCheck` request matches the value
of `HealthCheckVersion` in the health check, Route 53 updates the
health check with the new settings.

- If the value of `HealthCheckVersion` in the health check is
greater, the health check was changed after you got the version number. Route 53
does not update the health check, and it returns a
`HealthCheckVersionMismatch` error.

Type: Long

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1.

Required: No

**[HealthThreshold](#API_UpdateHealthCheck_RequestSyntax)**

The number of child health checks that are associated with a `CALCULATED`
health that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the `CALCULATED` health
check to be considered healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to
associate with a `CALCULATED` health check, use the
`ChildHealthChecks` and `ChildHealthCheck` elements.

Note the following:

- If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route
53 always considers this health check to be unhealthy.

- If you specify `0`, Route 53 always considers this health check to
be healthy.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0. Maximum value of 256.

Required: No

**[InsufficientDataHealthStatus](#API_UpdateHealthCheck_RequestSyntax)**

When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state,
the status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

- `Healthy`: Route 53 considers the health check to be
healthy.

- `Unhealthy`: Route 53 considers the health check to be
unhealthy.

- `LastKnownStatus`: By default, Route 53 uses the status of the
health check from the last time CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the
alarm state. For new health checks that have no last known status, the status
for the health check is healthy.

Type: String

Valid Values: `Healthy | Unhealthy | LastKnownStatus`

Required: No

**[Inverted](#API_UpdateHealthCheck_RequestSyntax)**

Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for
example, to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered
healthy.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[IPAddress](#API_UpdateHealthCheck_RequestSyntax)**

The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address for the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform
health checks on. If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`, Route 53
sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name that you specify in
`FullyQualifiedDomainName` at the interval that you specify in
`RequestInterval`. Using an IP address that is returned by DNS, Route 53
then checks the health of the endpoint.

Use one of the following formats for the value of `IPAddress`:

- **IPv4 address**: four values between 0 and 255,
separated by periods (.), for example, `192.0.2.44`.

- **IPv6 address**: eight groups of four
hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for example,
`2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`. You can also shorten
IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example,
`2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`.

If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP
address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for
`IPAddress`. This ensures that the IP address of your instance never
changes. For more information, see the applicable documentation:

- Linux: [Elastic IP\
Addresses (EIP)](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux_
_Instances_

- Windows: [Elastic IP\
Addresses (EIP)](../../../../services/ec2/latest/windowsguide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows_
_Instances_

###### Note

If a health check already has a value for `IPAddress`, you can change
the value. However, you can't update an existing health check to add or remove the
value of `IPAddress`.

For more information, see [FullyQualifiedDomainName](api-updatehealthcheck-route53-updatehealthcheck-request-fullyqualifieddomainname.md).

Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is
in local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP
addresses for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

- [RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4\
Addresses](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735)

- [RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4\
Prefix for Shared Address Space](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598)
