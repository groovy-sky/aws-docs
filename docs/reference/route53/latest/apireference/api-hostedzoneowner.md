# HostedZoneOwner

A complex type that identifies a hosted zone that a specified Amazon VPC is associated
with and the owner of the hosted zone. If there is a value for
`OwningAccount`, there is no value for `OwningService`, and
vice versa.

## Contents

**OwningAccount**

If the hosted zone was created by an AWS account, or was created by an
AWS service that creates hosted zones using the current account,
`OwningAccount` contains the account ID of that account. For example,
when you use AWS Cloud Map to create a hosted zone, Cloud Map creates the hosted
zone using the current AWS account.

Type: String

Required: No

**OwningService**

If an AWS service uses its own account to create a hosted zone and
associate the specified VPC with that hosted zone, `OwningService` contains
an abbreviation that identifies the service. For example, if Amazon Elastic File System
(Amazon EFS) created a hosted zone and associated a VPC with the hosted zone, the value
of `OwningService` is `efs.amazonaws.com`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 128.
