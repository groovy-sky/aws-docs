# CheckDomainAvailability

This operation checks the availability of one domain name. Note that if the
availability status of a domain is pending, you must submit another request to determine
the availability of the domain name.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "DomainName": "string",
   "IdnLangCode": "string"
}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[DomainName](#API_domains_CheckDomainAvailability_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the domain that you want to get availability for. The top-level domain
(TLD), such as .com, must be a TLD that Route 53 supports. For a list of supported TLDs,
see [Domains that You Can\
Register with Amazon Route 53](../../../../services/route53/latest/developerguide/registrar-tld-list.md) in the _Amazon Route 53 Developer_
_Guide_.

The domain name can contain only the following characters:

- Letters a through z. Domain names are not case sensitive.

- Numbers 0 through 9.

- Hyphen (-). You can't specify a hyphen at the beginning or end of a label.

- Period (.) to separate the labels in the name, such as the `.` in
`example.com`.

Internationalized domain names are not supported for some top-level domains. To
determine whether the TLD that you want to use supports internationalized domain names,
see [Domains that You Can\
Register with Amazon Route 53](../../../../services/route53/latest/developerguide/registrar-tld-list.md). For more information, see [Formatting Internationalized Domain Names](../../../../services/route53/latest/developerguide/domainnameformat.md#domain-name-format-idns).

## Response Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "Availability": "string"
}
```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[Availability](#API_domains_CheckDomainAvailability_ResponseSyntax)**

Whether the domain name is available for registering.

###### Note

You can register only domains designated as `AVAILABLE`.

Valid values:

AVAILABLE

The domain name is available.

AVAILABLE\_RESERVED

The domain name is reserved under specific conditions.

AVAILABLE\_PREORDER

The domain name is available and can be preordered.

DONT\_KNOW

The TLD registry didn't reply with a definitive answer about whether the
domain name is available. Route 53 can return this response for a variety of
reasons, for example, the registry is performing maintenance. Try again
later.

INVALID\_NAME\_FOR\_TLD

The TLD isn't valid. For example, it can contain characters that aren't allowed.

PENDING

The TLD registry didn't return a response in the expected amount of time.
When the response is delayed, it usually takes just a few extra seconds. You
can resubmit the request immediately.

RESERVED

The domain name has been reserved for another person or
organization.

UNAVAILABLE

The domain name is not available.

UNAVAILABLE\_PREMIUM

The domain name is not available.

UNAVAILABLE\_RESTRICTED

The domain name is forbidden.

Type: String

Valid Values: `AVAILABLE | AVAILABLE_RESERVED | AVAILABLE_PREORDER | UNAVAILABLE | UNAVAILABLE_PREMIUM | UNAVAILABLE_RESTRICTED | RESERVED | DONT_KNOW | INVALID_NAME_FOR_TLD | PENDING`

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**InvalidInput**

The requested item is not acceptable. For example, for APIs that accept a domain name,
the request might specify a domain name that doesn't belong to the account that
submitted the request. For `AcceptDomainTransferFromAnotherAwsAccount`, the
password might be invalid.

**message**

The requested item is not acceptable. For example, for an OperationId it might refer
to the ID of an operation that is already completed. For a domain name, it might not be
a valid domain name or belong to the requester account.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**UnsupportedTLD**

Amazon Route 53 does not support this top-level domain (TLD).

**message**

Amazon Route 53 does not support this top-level domain (TLD).

HTTP Status Code: 400
