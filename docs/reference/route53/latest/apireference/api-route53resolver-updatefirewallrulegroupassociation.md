# UpdateFirewallRuleGroupAssociation

Changes the association of a [FirewallRuleGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_FirewallRuleGroup.html) with a VPC. The association enables DNS filtering for the VPC.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "FirewallRuleGroupAssociationId": "string",
   "MutationProtection": "string",
   "Name": "string",
   "Priority": number
}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[FirewallRuleGroupAssociationId](#API_route53resolver_UpdateFirewallRuleGroupAssociation_RequestSyntax)**

The identifier of the [FirewallRuleGroupAssociation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_FirewallRuleGroupAssociation.html).

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.

Required: Yes

**[MutationProtection](#API_route53resolver_UpdateFirewallRuleGroupAssociation_RequestSyntax)**

If enabled, this setting disallows modification or removal of the association, to help prevent against accidentally altering DNS firewall protections.

Type: String

Valid Values: `ENABLED | DISABLED`

Required: No

**[Name](#API_route53resolver_UpdateFirewallRuleGroupAssociation_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the rule group association.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 64.

Pattern: `(?!^[0-9]+$)([a-zA-Z0-9\-_' ']+)`

Required: No

**[Priority](#API_route53resolver_UpdateFirewallRuleGroupAssociation_RequestSyntax)**

The setting that determines the processing order of the rule group among the rule
groups that you associate with the specified VPC. DNS Firewall filters VPC traffic
starting from the rule group with the lowest numeric priority setting.

You must specify a unique priority for each rule group that you associate with a single VPC.
To make it easier to insert rule groups later, leave space between the numbers, for example, use 100, 200, and so on. You
can change the priority setting for a rule group association after you create it.

Type: Integer

Required: No
