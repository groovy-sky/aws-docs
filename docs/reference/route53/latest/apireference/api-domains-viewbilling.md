   "Marker": "string",
   "MaxItems": number,

}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[End](#API_domains_ViewBilling_RequestSyntax)**

The end date and time for the time period for which you want a list of billing
records. Specify the date and time in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal time
(UTC).

Type: Timestamp

**[Marker](#API_domains_ViewBilling_RequestSyntax)**

For an initial request for a list of billing records, omit this element. If the number
of billing records that are associated with the current AWS account
during the specified period is greater than the value that you specified for
`MaxItems`, you can use `Marker` to return additional billing
records. Get the value of `NextPageMarker` from the previous response, and
submit another request that includes the value of `NextPageMarker` in the
`Marker` element.

Constraints: The marker must match the value of `NextPageMarker` that was
returned in the previous response.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 4096.

Required: No

**[MaxItems](#API_domains_ViewBilling_RequestSyntax)**

The number of billing records to be returned.

Default: 20

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Maximum value of 100.

Required: No

**[Start](#API_domains_ViewBilling_RequestSyntax)**

The beginning date and time for the time period for which you want a list of billing
records. Specify the date and time in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal time
(UTC).

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

## Response Syntax

   "BillingRecords": [
      {
         "BillDate": number,
         "DomainName": "string",

         "Price": number
      }
   ],
   "NextPageMarker": "string"
}

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[BillingRecords](#API_domains_ViewBilling_ResponseSyntax)**

A summary of billing records.

Type: Array of [BillingRecord](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_BillingRecord.html) objects

**[NextPageMarker](#API_domains_ViewBilling_ResponseSyntax)**

If there are more billing records than you specified for `MaxItems` in the
request, submit another request and include the value of `NextPageMarker` in
the value of `Marker`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 4096.

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**InvalidInput**

The requested item is not acceptable. For example, for APIs that accept a domain name,
the request might specify a domain name that doesn't belong to the account that
submitted the request. For `AcceptDomainTransferFromAnotherAwsAccount`, the
password might be invalid.

**message**

The requested item is not acceptable. For example, for an OperationId it might refer
to the ID of an operation that is already completed. For a domain name, it might not be
a valid domain name or belong to the requester account.

HTTP Status Code: 400
