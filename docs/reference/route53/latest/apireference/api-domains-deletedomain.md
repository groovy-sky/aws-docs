# DeleteDomain

This operation deletes the specified domain. This action is permanent. For more
information, see [Deleting a domain name\
registration](../../../../services/route53/latest/developerguide/domain-delete.md).

To transfer the domain registration to another registrar, use the transfer process
that’s provided by the registrar to which you want to transfer the registration.
Otherwise, the following apply:

1. You can’t get a refund for the cost of a deleted domain registration.

2. The registry for the top-level domain might hold the domain name for a brief
    time before releasing it for other users to register (varies by registry).

3. When the registration has been deleted, we'll send you a confirmation to the
    registrant contact. The email will come from
    `noreply@domainnameverification.net` or
    `noreply@emailverification.info` or
    `noreply@registrar.amazon`.
