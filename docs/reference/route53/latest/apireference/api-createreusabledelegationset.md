# CreateReusableDelegationSet

Creates a delegation set (a group of four name servers) that can be reused by multiple
hosted zones that were created by the same AWS account.

You can also create a reusable delegation set that uses the four name servers that are
associated with an existing hosted zone. Specify the hosted zone ID in the
`CreateReusableDelegationSet` request.

###### Note

You can't associate a reusable delegation set with a private hosted zone.

For information about using a reusable delegation set to configure white label name
servers, see [Configuring White\
Label Name Servers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/white-label-name-servers.html).

The process for migrating existing hosted zones to use a reusable delegation set is
comparable to the process for configuring white label name servers. You need to perform
the following steps:

1. Create a reusable delegation set.

2. Recreate hosted zones, and reduce the TTL to 60 seconds or less.

3. Recreate resource record sets in the new hosted zones.

4. Change the registrar's name servers to use the name servers for the new hosted
    zones.

5. Monitor traffic for the website or application.

6. Change TTLs back to their original values.

If you want to migrate existing hosted zones to use a reusable delegation set, the
existing hosted zones can't use any of the name servers that are assigned to the
reusable delegation set. If one or more hosted zones do use one or more name servers
that are assigned to the reusable delegation set, you can do one of the
following:

- For small numbers of hosted zones—up to a few hundred—it's
relatively easy to create reusable delegation sets until you get one that has
four name servers that don't overlap with any of the name servers in your hosted
zones.

- For larger numbers of hosted zones, the easiest solution is to use more than
one reusable delegation set.

- For larger numbers of hosted zones, you can also migrate hosted zones that
have overlapping name servers to hosted zones that don't have overlapping name
servers, then migrate the hosted zones again to use the reusable delegation
set.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CreateReusableDelegationSetRequest xmlns="https://route53.amazonaws.com/doc/2013-04-01/">

```

## URI Request Parameters

The request does not use any URI parameters.

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in XML format.

**[CreateReusableDelegationSetRequest](#API_CreateReusableDelegationSet_RequestSyntax)**

Root level tag for the CreateReusableDelegationSetRequest parameters.

Required: Yes

**[CallerReference](#API_CreateReusableDelegationSet_RequestSyntax)**

A unique string that identifies the request, and that allows you to retry failed
`CreateReusableDelegationSet` requests without the risk of executing the
operation twice. You must use a unique `CallerReference` string every time
you submit a `CreateReusableDelegationSet` request.
`CallerReference` can be any unique string, for example a date/time
stamp.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Required: Yes

**[HostedZoneId](#API_CreateReusableDelegationSet_RequestSyntax)**

If you want to mark the delegation set for an existing hosted zone as reusable, the ID
for that hosted zone.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 32.

Required: No

## Response Syntax

```nohighlight

HTTP/1.1 201
Location: Location
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CreateReusableDelegationSetResponse>
   <DelegationSet>
      <CallerReference>string</CallerReference>
      <Id>string</Id>
      <NameServers>
         <NameServer>string</NameServer>
      </NameServers>
   </DelegationSet>
</CreateReusableDelegationSetResponse>
```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 201 response.

The response returns the following HTTP headers.

**[Location](#API_CreateReusableDelegationSet_ResponseSyntax)**

The unique URL representing the new reusable delegation set.

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 1024.

The following data is returned in XML format by the service.

**[CreateReusableDelegationSetResponse](#API_CreateReusableDelegationSet_ResponseSyntax)**

Root level tag for the CreateReusableDelegationSetResponse parameters.

Required: Yes

**[DelegationSet](#API_CreateReusableDelegationSet_ResponseSyntax)**

A complex type that contains name server information.

Type: [DelegationSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_DelegationSet.html) object

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html).

**DelegationSetAlreadyCreated**

A delegation set with the same owner and caller reference combination has already been
created.

**message**

HTTP Status Code: 400

**DelegationSetAlreadyReusable**

The specified delegation set has already been marked as reusable.

**message**

HTTP Status Code: 400

**DelegationSetNotAvailable**

You can create a hosted zone that has the same name as an existing hosted zone
(example.com is common), but there is a limit to the number of hosted zones that have
the same name. If you get this error, Amazon Route 53 has reached that limit. If you own
the domain name and Route 53 generates this error, contact Customer Support.

**message**

HTTP Status Code: 400

**HostedZoneNotFound**

The specified HostedZone can't be found.

**message**

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InvalidArgument**

Parameter name is not valid.

**message**

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InvalidInput**

The input is not valid.

**message**

HTTP Status Code: 400

**LimitsExceeded**

This operation can't be completed because the current account has reached the
limit on the resource you are trying to create. To request a higher limit, [create a case](http://aws.amazon.com/route53-request) with the AWS Support
Center.

**message**

HTTP Status Code: 400
