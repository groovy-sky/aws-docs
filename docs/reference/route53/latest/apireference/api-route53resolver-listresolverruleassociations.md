## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "Filters": [
      {
         "Name": "string",
         "Values": [ "string" ]
      }
   ],
   "MaxResults": number,
   "NextToken": "string"
}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[Filters](#API_route53resolver_ListResolverRuleAssociations_RequestSyntax)**

An optional specification to return a subset of Resolver rules, such as Resolver rules that are associated with the same VPC ID.

###### Note

If you submit a second or subsequent `ListResolverRuleAssociations` request and specify the `NextToken` parameter,
you must use the same values for `Filters`, if any, as in the previous request.

Type: Array of [Filter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_Filter.html) objects

Required: No

**[MaxResults](#API_route53resolver_ListResolverRuleAssociations_RequestSyntax)**

The maximum number of rule associations that you want to return in the response to a `ListResolverRuleAssociations` request.
If you don't specify a value for `MaxResults`, Resolver returns up to 100 rule associations.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 100.

Required: No

**[NextToken](#API_route53resolver_ListResolverRuleAssociations_RequestSyntax)**

For the first `ListResolverRuleAssociation` request, omit this value.

If you have more than `MaxResults` rule associations, you can submit another `ListResolverRuleAssociation` request
to get the next group of rule associations. In the next request, specify the value of `NextToken` from the previous response.

Type: String

Required: No
