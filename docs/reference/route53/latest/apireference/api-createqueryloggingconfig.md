# CreateQueryLoggingConfig

Creates a configuration for DNS query logging. After you create a query logging
configuration, Amazon Route 53 begins to publish log data to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs
log group.

DNS query logs contain information about the queries that Route 53 receives for a
specified public hosted zone, such as the following:

- Route 53 edge location that responded to the DNS query

- Domain or subdomain that was requested

- DNS record type, such as A or AAAA

- DNS response code, such as `NoError` or
`ServFail`

Log Group and Resource Policy

Before you create a query logging configuration, perform the following
operations.

###### Note

If you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53
console, Route 53 performs these operations automatically.

1. Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the ARN,
    which you specify when you create a query logging configuration.
    Note the following:

- You must create the log group in the us-east-1
region.

- You must use the same AWS account to create
the log group and the hosted zone that you want to configure
query logging for.

- When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend
that you use a consistent prefix, for example:

`/aws/route53/hosted zone
  											name
                             `

In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which
controls access to one or more log groups and the associated
AWS resources, such as Route 53 hosted
zones. There's a limit on the number of resource policies
that you can create, so we recommend that you use a
consistent prefix so you can use the same resource policy
for all the log groups that you create for query
logging.

2. Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the
    permissions that Route 53 needs to create log streams and to send
    query logs to log streams. You must create the CloudWatch Logs resource policy in the us-east-1
    region. For the value of `Resource`,
    specify the ARN for the log group that you created in the previous
    step. To use the same resource policy for all the CloudWatch Logs
    log groups that you created for query logging configurations,
    replace the hosted zone name with `*`, for
    example:

`arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/*`

To avoid the confused deputy problem, a security issue where an
    entity without a permission for an action can coerce a
    more-privileged entity to perform it, you can optionally limit the
    permissions that a service has to a resource in a resource-based
    policy by supplying the following values:

- For `aws:SourceArn`, supply the hosted zone ARN
used in creating the query logging configuration. For
example, `aws:SourceArn:
  											arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/hosted zone
  										ID`.

- For `aws:SourceAccount`, supply the account ID
for the account that creates the query logging
configuration. For example,
`aws:SourceAccount:111111111111`.

For more information, see [The confused\
deputy problem](../../../../services/iam/latest/userguide/confused-deputy.md) in the _AWS_
_IAM User Guide_.

###### Note

You can't use the CloudWatch console to create or edit a
resource policy. You must use the CloudWatch API, one of the
AWS SDKs, or the AWS CLI.

Log Streams and Edge Locations

When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for DNS query logging,
it does the following:

- Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the
edge location responds to DNS queries for the specified hosted zone.
That log stream is used to log all queries that Route 53 responds to
for that edge location.

- Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream.

The name of each log stream is in the following format:

`
                  hosted zone ID/edge location
								code
               `

The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned
number, for example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically corresponds with
the International Air Transport Association airport code for an airport near
the edge location. (These abbreviations might change in the future.) For a
list of edge locations, see "The Route 53 Global Network" on the [Route 53 Product Details](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/details)
page.

Queries That Are Logged

Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers forward to Route
53\. If a DNS resolver has already cached the response to a query (such as
the IP address for a load balancer for example.com), the resolver will
continue to return the cached response. It doesn't forward another query to
Route 53 until the TTL for the corresponding resource record set expires.
Depending on how many DNS queries are submitted for a resource record set,
and depending on the TTL for that resource record set, query logs might
contain information about only one query out of every several thousand
queries that are submitted to DNS. For more information about how DNS works,
see [Routing\
Internet Traffic to Your Website or Web Application](../../../../services/route53/latest/developerguide/welcome-dns-service.md) in the
_Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_.

Log File Format

For a list of the values in each query log and the format of each value,
see [Logging DNS\
Queries](../../../../services/route53/latest/developerguide/query-logs.md) in the _Amazon Route 53 Developer_
_Guide_.

Pricing

For information about charges for query logs, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing).

How to Stop Logging

If you want Route 53 to stop sending query logs to CloudWatch Logs, delete
the query logging configuration. For more information, see [DeleteQueryLoggingConfig](api-deletequeryloggingconfig.md).

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**ConcurrentModification**

Another user submitted a request to create, update, or delete the object at the same
time that you did. Retry the request.

**message**

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InsufficientCloudWatchLogsResourcePolicy**

Amazon Route 53 doesn't have the permissions required to create log streams and send
query logs to log streams. Possible causes include the following:

- There is no resource policy that specifies the log group ARN in the value for
`Resource`.

- The resource policy that includes the log group ARN in the value for
`Resource` doesn't have the necessary permissions.

- The resource policy hasn't finished propagating yet.

- The Key management service (KMS) key you specified doesn’t exist or it can’t
be used with the log group associated with query log. Update or provide a
resource policy to grant permissions for the KMS key.

- The Key management service (KMS) key you specified is marked as
disabled for the log group associated with query log. Update or provide
a resource policy to grant permissions for the KMS key.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InvalidInput**

The input is not valid.

**message**

HTTP Status Code: 400

**NoSuchCloudWatchLogsLogGroup**

There is no CloudWatch Logs log group with the specified ARN.

HTTP Status Code: 404

**NoSuchHostedZone**

No hosted zone exists with the ID that you specified.

**message**

HTTP Status Code: 404

**QueryLoggingConfigAlreadyExists**

You can create only one query logging configuration for a hosted zone, and a query
logging configuration already exists for this hosted zone.

HTTP Status Code: 409

## Examples

### Example Request
