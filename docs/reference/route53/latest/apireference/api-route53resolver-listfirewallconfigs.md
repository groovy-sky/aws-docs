# ListFirewallConfigs

Retrieves the firewall configurations that you have defined. DNS Firewall uses the configurations to manage firewall behavior for your VPCs.

A single call might return only a partial list of the configurations. For information, see `MaxResults`.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "MaxResults": number,
   "NextToken": "string"
}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[MaxResults](#API_route53resolver_ListFirewallConfigs_RequestSyntax)**

The maximum number of objects that you want Resolver to return for this request. If more
objects are available, in the response, Resolver provides a
`NextToken` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.

If you don't specify a value for `MaxResults`, Resolver returns up to 100 objects.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 5. Maximum value of 10.

Required: No

**[NextToken](#API_route53resolver_ListFirewallConfigs_RequestSyntax)**

For the first call to this list request, omit this value.

When you request a list of objects, Resolver returns at most the number of objects
specified in `MaxResults`. If more objects are available for retrieval,
Resolver returns a `NextToken` value in the response. To retrieve the next
batch of objects, use the token that was returned for the prior request in your next request.

Type: String

Required: No
