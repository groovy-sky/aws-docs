# GetDomainSuggestions

The GetDomainSuggestions operation returns a list of suggested domain names.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "DomainName": "string",
   "OnlyAvailable": boolean,
   "SuggestionCount": number
}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[DomainName](#API_domains_GetDomainSuggestions_RequestSyntax)**

A domain name that you want to use as the basis for a list of possible domain names.
The top-level domain (TLD), such as .com, must be a TLD that Route 53 supports. For a
list of supported TLDs, see [Domains that You Can\
Register with Amazon Route 53](../../../../services/route53/latest/developerguide/registrar-tld-list.md) in the _Amazon Route 53 Developer_
_Guide_.

The domain name can contain only the following characters:

- Letters a through z. Domain names are not case sensitive.

- Numbers 0 through 9.

- Hyphen (-). You can't specify a hyphen at the beginning or end of a label.

- Period (.) to separate the labels in the name, such as the `.` in
`example.com`.

Internationalized domain names are not supported for some top-level domains. To
determine whether the TLD that you want to use supports internationalized domain names,
see [Domains that You Can\
Register with Amazon Route 53](../../../../services/route53/latest/developerguide/registrar-tld-list.md).

Type: String

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 255.

Required: Yes

**[OnlyAvailable](#API_domains_GetDomainSuggestions_RequestSyntax)**

If `OnlyAvailable` is `true`, Route 53 returns only domain names
that are available. If `OnlyAvailable` is `false`, Route 53
returns domain names without checking whether they're available to be registered. To
determine whether the domain is available, you can call
`checkDomainAvailability` for each suggestion.

Type: Boolean

Required: Yes

**[SuggestionCount](#API_domains_GetDomainSuggestions_RequestSyntax)**

The number of suggested domain names that you want Route 53 to return. Specify a value
between 1 and 50. Note that fewer than the requested number might be returned.

Type: Integer

Required: Yes

## Response Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "SuggestionsList": [
      {
         "Availability": "string",
         "DomainName": "string"
      }
   ]
}
```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[SuggestionsList](#API_domains_GetDomainSuggestions_ResponseSyntax)**

A list of possible domain names. If you specified `true` for
`OnlyAvailable` in the request, the list contains only domains that are
available for registration.

Type: Array of [DomainSuggestion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_DomainSuggestion.html) objects

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**InvalidInput**

The requested item is not acceptable. For example, for APIs that accept a domain name,
the request might specify a domain name that doesn't belong to the account that
submitted the request. For `AcceptDomainTransferFromAnotherAwsAccount`, the
password might be invalid.

**message**

The requested item is not acceptable. For example, for an OperationId it might refer
to the ID of an operation that is already completed. For a domain name, it might not be
a valid domain name or belong to the requester account.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**UnsupportedTLD**

Amazon Route 53 does not support this top-level domain (TLD).

**message**

Amazon Route 53 does not support this top-level domain (TLD).

HTTP Status Code: 400
