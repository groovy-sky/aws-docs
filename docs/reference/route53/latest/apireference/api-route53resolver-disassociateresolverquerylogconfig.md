# DisassociateResolverQueryLogConfig

Disassociates a VPC from a query logging configuration.

###### Note

Before you can delete a query logging configuration, you must first disassociate all VPCs
from the configuration. If you used AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) to share a
query logging configuration with other accounts, VPCs can be disassociated from the
configuration in the following ways:

- The accounts that you shared the configuration with can disassociate VPCs from the configuration.

- You can stop sharing the configuration.
