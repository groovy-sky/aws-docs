# GeoProximityLocation

(Resource record sets only): A complex type that lets you specify where your resources are
located. Only one of `LocalZoneGroup`, `Coordinates`, or
`
         AWSRegion` is allowed per request at a time.

For more information about geoproximity routing, see [Geoproximity routing](../../../../services/route53/latest/developerguide/routing-policy-geoproximity.md) in the
_Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_.

## Contents

**AWSRegion**

The AWS Region the resource you are directing DNS traffic to, is in.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.

Required: No

**Bias**

The bias increases or decreases the size of the geographic region from which Route 53 routes traffic to a resource.

To use `Bias` to change the size of the geographic region, specify the
applicable value for the bias:

- To expand the size of the geographic region from which Route 53 routes traffic to a resource, specify a
positive integer from 1 to 99 for the bias. Route 53 shrinks the size of adjacent regions.

- To shrink the size of the geographic region from which Route 53 routes traffic to a resource, specify a
negative bias of -1 to -99. Route 53 expands the size of adjacent regions.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of -99. Maximum value of 99.

Required: No

**Coordinates**

Contains the longitude and latitude for a geographic region.

Type: [Coordinates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_Coordinates.html) object

Required: No

**LocalZoneGroup**

Specifies an AWS Local Zone Group.

A local Zone Group is usually the Local Zone code without the ending character. For example,
if the Local Zone is `us-east-1-bue-1a` the Local Zone Group is `us-east-1-bue-1`.

You can identify the Local Zones Group for a specific Local Zone by using the [describe-availability-zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-availability-zones.html) CLI command:

This command returns: `"GroupName": "us-west-2-den-1"`, specifying that the Local Zone `us-west-2-den-1a`
belongs to the Local Zone Group `us-west-2-den-1`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.

Required: No
