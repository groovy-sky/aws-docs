# Expression

Use `Expression` to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

Not all `Expression` types are supported in each API. Refer to the
documentation for each specific API to see what is supported.

There are two patterns:

- Simple dimension values.

- There are three types of simple dimension values:
`CostCategories`, `Tags`, and
`Dimensions`.

- Specify the `CostCategories` field to define a
filter that acts on Cost Categories.

- Specify the `Tags` field to define a filter that
acts on Cost Allocation Tags.

- Specify the `Dimensions` field to define a filter
that acts on the [`DimensionValues`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html).

- For each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values for
the filters that you plan to use.

- For example, you can filter for `REGION==us-east-1 OR
                                          REGION==us-west-1`. For
`GetRightsizingRecommendation`, the Region is a
full name (for example, `REGION==US East (N.
                                          Virginia)`.

- The corresponding `Expression` for this example is
as follows: `{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [
                                          "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }`

- As shown in the previous example, lists of dimension values
are combined with `OR` when applying the
filter.

- You can also set different match options to further control how the
filter behaves. Not all APIs support match options. Refer to the
documentation for each specific API to see what is supported.

- For example, you can filter for linked account names that
start with "a".

- The corresponding `Expression` for this example is
as follows: `{ "Dimensions": { "Key":
                                          "LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME", "MatchOptions": [ "STARTS_WITH" ],
                                          "Values": [ "a" ] } }`

- Compound `Expression` types with logical operations.

- You can use multiple `Expression` types and the logical
operators `AND/OR/NOT` to create a list of one or more
`Expression` objects. By doing this, you can filter by
more advanced options.

- For example, you can filter by `((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION
                                  == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE !=
                                  DataTransfer)`.

- The corresponding `Expression` for this example is as
follows: `{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION",
                                  "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": { "Key":
                                  "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions": {
                                  "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }
                              `

###### Note

Because each `Expression` can have only one operator, the
service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following
example shows an `Expression` object that creates an error:
` { "And": [ ... ], "Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values":
                            [ "DataTransfer" ] } } `

The following is an example of the corresponding error message:
`"Expression has more than one roots. Only one root operator is
                            allowed for each expression: And, Or, Not, Dimensions, Tags,
                            CostCategories"`

###### Note

For the `GetRightsizingRecommendation` action, a combination of OR and
NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different dimensions, or dimensions
and tags. NOT operators aren't supported. Dimensions are also limited to
`LINKED_ACCOUNT`, `REGION`, or
`RIGHTSIZING_TYPE`.

For the `GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation` action, only NOT is
supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited to
`LINKED_ACCOUNT`.
