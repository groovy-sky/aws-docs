# UpdateAutoScalingGroup

**We strongly recommend that all Auto Scaling groups use launch templates to ensure full functionality for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Amazon EC2.**

Updates the configuration for the specified Auto Scaling group.

To update an Auto Scaling group, specify the name of the group and the property that you want
to change. Any properties that you don't specify are not changed by this update request.
The new settings take effect on any scaling activities after this call returns.

If you associate a new launch configuration or template with an Auto Scaling group, all new
instances will get the updated configuration. Existing instances continue to run with
the configuration that they were originally launched with. When you update a group to
specify a mixed instances policy instead of a launch configuration or template, existing
instances may be replaced to match the new purchasing options that you specified in the
policy. For example, if the group currently has 100% On-Demand capacity and the policy
specifies 50% Spot capacity, this means that half of your instances will be gradually
terminated and relaunched as Spot Instances. When replacing instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches
new instances before terminating the old ones, so that updating your group does not
compromise the performance or availability of your application.

Note the following about changing `DesiredCapacity`, `MaxSize`,
or `MinSize`:

- If a scale-in activity occurs as a result of a new
`DesiredCapacity` value that is lower than the current size of
the group, the Auto Scaling group uses its termination policy to determine which
instances to terminate.

- If you specify a new value for `MinSize` without specifying a value
for `DesiredCapacity`, and the new `MinSize` is larger
than the current size of the group, this sets the group's
`DesiredCapacity` to the new `MinSize` value.

- If you specify a new value for `MaxSize` without specifying a value
for `DesiredCapacity`, and the new `MaxSize` is smaller
than the current size of the group, this sets the group's
`DesiredCapacity` to the new `MaxSize` value.

To see which properties have been set, call the [DescribeAutoScalingGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeAutoScalingGroups.html) API.
To view the scaling policies for an Auto Scaling
group, call the [DescribePolicies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribePolicies.html) API. If the group has scaling
policies, you can update them by calling the [PutScalingPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_PutScalingPolicy.html) API.

**CapacityRebalance**

Enables or disables Capacity Rebalancing. If Capacity Rebalancing is disabled, proactive replacement of at-risk Spot Instances does not occur. For more information, see [Capacity\
Rebalancing in Auto Scaling to replace at-risk Spot Instances](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-capacity-rebalancing.md) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

###### Note

To suspend rebalancing across Availability Zones, use the [SuspendProcesses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_SuspendedProcess.html) API.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**CapacityReservationSpecification**

The capacity reservation specification for the Auto Scaling group.

Type: [CapacityReservationSpecification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_CapacityReservationSpecification.html) object

Required: No

**Context**

Reserved.

Type: String

Required: No

**DefaultCooldown**

_Only needed if you use simple scaling policies._

The amount of time, in seconds, between one scaling activity ending and another one
starting due to simple scaling policies. For more information, see [Scaling\
cooldowns for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-cooldowns.md) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**DefaultInstanceWarmup**

The amount of time, in seconds, until a new instance is considered to have finished
initializing and resource consumption to become stable after it enters the
`InService` state.

During an instance refresh, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits for the warm-up period after it replaces an
instance before it moves on to replacing the next instance. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling also waits for the
warm-up period before aggregating the metrics for new instances with existing instances
in the Amazon CloudWatch metrics that are used for scaling, resulting in more reliable usage
data. For more information, see [Set\
the default instance warmup for an Auto Scaling group](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

###### Important

To manage various warm-up settings at the group level, we recommend that you set
the default instance warmup, _even if it is set to 0 seconds_. To
remove a value that you previously set, include the property but specify
`-1` for the value. However, we strongly recommend keeping the
default instance warmup enabled by specifying a value of `0` or other
nominal value.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**DeletionProtection**

The deletion protection setting for the Auto Scaling group. This setting helps safeguard your Auto Scaling group and its
instances by controlling whether the `DeleteAutoScalingGroup` operation is allowed. When deletion
protection is enabled, users cannot delete the Auto Scaling group according to the specified protection level until
the setting is changed back to a less restrictive level.

The valid values are `none`, `prevent-force-deletion`, and `prevent-all-deletion`.

Default: `none`

For more information, see
[Configure deletion protection for your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/resource-deletion-protection.html)
in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

Type: String

Valid Values: `none | prevent-force-deletion | prevent-all-deletion`

Required: No

**DesiredCapacity**

The desired capacity is the initial capacity of the Auto Scaling group after this operation
completes and the capacity it attempts to maintain. This number must be greater than or
equal to the minimum size of the group and less than or equal to the maximum size of the
group.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**DesiredCapacityType**

The unit of measurement for the value specified for desired capacity. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
supports `DesiredCapacityType` for attribute-based instance type selection
only. For more information, see [Create a mixed instances group using attribute-based instance type\
selection](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-mixed-instances-group-attribute-based-instance-type-selection.md) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling specifies `units`, which translates into number of
instances.

Required: No

**HealthCheckGracePeriod**

The amount of time, in seconds, that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits before checking the health status
of an EC2 instance that has come into service and marking it unhealthy due to a failed
health check. This is useful if your instances do not immediately pass their health
checks after they enter the `InService` state. For more information, see
[Set the health check\
grace period for an Auto Scaling group](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/health-check-grace-period.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**HealthCheckType**

A comma-separated value string of one or more health check types.

The valid values are `EC2`, `EBS`, `ELB`, and
`VPC_LATTICE`. `EC2` is the default health check and cannot be
disabled. For more information, see [Health checks\
for instances in an Auto Scaling group](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-health-checks.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.
