# CreateAutoScalingGroup

**We strongly recommend using a launch template when calling this operation to ensure full functionality for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Amazon EC2.**

Creates an Auto Scaling group with the specified name and attributes.

If you exceed your maximum limit of Auto Scaling groups, the call fails. To query this limit,
call the [DescribeAccountLimits](api-describeaccountlimits.md) API. For information about updating
this limit, see [Quotas for\
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-quotas.md) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

If you're new to Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, see the introductory tutorials in [Get started\
with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/get-started-with-ec2-auto-scaling.md) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

Every Auto Scaling group has three size properties ( `DesiredCapacity`,
`MaxSize`, and `MinSize`). Usually, you set these sizes based
on a specific number of instances. However, if you configure a mixed instances policy
that defines weights for the instance types, you must specify these sizes with the same
units that you use for weighting instances.

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**AutoScalingGroupName**

The name of the Auto Scaling group. This name must be unique per Region per account.

The name can contain any ASCII character 33 to 126 including most punctuation
characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

###### Note

You cannot use a colon (:) in the name.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 255.

Pattern: `[\u0020-\uD7FF\uE000-\uFFFD\uD800\uDC00-\uDBFF\uDFFF\r\n\t]*`

Required: Yes

**AvailabilityZoneDistribution**

The instance capacity distribution across Availability Zones.

Type: [AvailabilityZoneDistribution](api-availabilityzonedistribution.md) object

Required: No

**AvailabilityZoneImpairmentPolicy**

The policy for Availability Zone impairment.

Type: [AvailabilityZoneImpairmentPolicy](api-availabilityzoneimpairmentpolicy.md) object

Required: No

**AvailabilityZones.member.N**

A list of Availability Zones where instances in the Auto Scaling group can be created. Used
for launching into the default VPC subnet in each Availability Zone when not using the
`VPCZoneIdentifier` property, or for attaching a network interface when
an existing network interface ID is specified in a launch template.

Type: Array of strings

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 255.

Pattern: `[\u0020-\uD7FF\uE000-\uFFFD\uD800\uDC00-\uDBFF\uDFFF\r\n\t]*`

Required: No

**CapacityRebalance**

Indicates whether Capacity Rebalancing is enabled. Otherwise, Capacity Rebalancing is
disabled. When you turn on Capacity Rebalancing, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling attempts to launch a Spot
Instance whenever Amazon EC2 notifies that a Spot Instance is at an elevated risk of
interruption. After launching a new instance, it then terminates an old instance. For
more information, see [Use Capacity\
Rebalancing to handle Amazon EC2 Spot Interruptions](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-capacity-rebalancing.md) in the in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**CapacityReservationSpecification**

The capacity reservation specification for the Auto Scaling group.

Type: [CapacityReservationSpecification](api-capacityreservationspecification.md) object

Required: No

**Context**

Reserved.

Type: String

Required: No

**DefaultCooldown**

_Only needed if you use simple scaling policies._

The amount of time, in seconds, between one scaling activity ending and another one
starting due to simple scaling policies. For more information, see [Scaling\
cooldowns for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-cooldowns.md) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

Default: `300` seconds

Type: Integer

Required: No

**DefaultInstanceWarmup**

The amount of time, in seconds, until a new instance is considered to have finished
initializing and resource consumption to become stable after it enters the
`InService` state.

During an instance refresh, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits for the warm-up period after it replaces an
instance before it moves on to replacing the next instance. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling also waits for the
warm-up period before aggregating the metrics for new instances with existing instances
in the Amazon CloudWatch metrics that are used for scaling, resulting in more reliable usage
data. For more information, see [Set\
the default instance warmup for an Auto Scaling group](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

###### Important

To manage various warm-up settings at the group level, we recommend that you set
the default instance warmup, _even if it is set to 0 seconds_. To
remove a value that you previously set, include the property but specify
`-1` for the value. However, we strongly recommend keeping the
default instance warmup enabled by specifying a value of `0` or other
nominal value.

Default: None

Type: Integer

Required: No

**DeletionProtection**

The deletion protection setting for the Auto Scaling group. This setting helps safeguard your Auto Scaling group and its
instances by controlling whether the `DeleteAutoScalingGroup` operation is allowed. When deletion
protection is enabled, users cannot delete the Auto Scaling group according to the specified protection level until
the setting is changed back to a less restrictive level.

The valid values are `none`, `prevent-force-deletion`, and `prevent-all-deletion`.

Default: `none`

For more information, see
[Configure deletion protection for your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling resources](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/resource-deletion-protection.md)
in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

Type: String

Valid Values: `none | prevent-force-deletion | prevent-all-deletion`

Required: No

**DesiredCapacity**

The desired capacity is the initial capacity of the Auto Scaling group at the time of its
creation and the capacity it attempts to maintain. It can scale beyond this capacity if
you configure auto scaling. This number must be greater than or equal to the minimum
size of the group and less than or equal to the maximum size of the group. If you do not
specify a desired capacity, the default is the minimum size of the group.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**DesiredCapacityType**

The unit of measurement for the value specified for desired capacity. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
supports `DesiredCapacityType` for attribute-based instance type selection
only. For more information, see [Create a mixed instances group using attribute-based instance type\
selection](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-mixed-instances-group-attribute-based-instance-type-selection.md) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

Required: No

**HealthCheckGracePeriod**

The amount of time, in seconds, that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits before checking the health status
of an EC2 instance that has come into service and marking it unhealthy due to a failed
health check. This is useful if your instances do not immediately pass their health
checks after they enter the `InService` state. For more information, see
[Set the health check\
grace period for an Auto Scaling group](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/health-check-grace-period.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

Default: `0` seconds

Type: Integer

Required: No

**HealthCheckType**

A comma-separated value string of one or more health check types.

The valid values are `EC2`, `EBS`, `ELB`, and
`VPC_LATTICE`. `EC2` is the default health check and cannot be
disabled. For more information, see [Health checks\
for instances in an Auto Scaling group](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-health-checks.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

Only specify `EC2` if you must clear a value that was previously
set.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 32.

Required: No

**InstanceLifecyclePolicy**

The instance lifecycle policy for the Auto Scaling group. This policy controls instance behavior when an instance
transitions through its lifecycle states. Configure retention triggers to specify when instances should
move to a `Retained` state instead of automatic termination.

For more information, see
[Control instance retention with instance lifecycle policies](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/instance-lifecycle-policy.md)
in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

###### Note

Instances in a Retained state will continue to incur standard EC2 charges until terminated.

_Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**MaxSize**

The maximum size of the group.

###### Note

With a mixed instances policy that uses instance weighting, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling may need to
go above `MaxSize` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event,
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will never go above `MaxSize` by more than your largest instance
weight (weights that define how many units each instance contributes to the desired
capacity of the group).

Type: Integer

Required: Yes

**MinSize**

The minimum size of the group.

Type: Integer

Required: Yes

**MixedInstancesPolicy**

The mixed instances policy.

The policy includes properties that not only define the distribution of
On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances and how the Auto Scaling group allocates instance types
to fulfill On-Demand and Spot capacities, but also the properties that specify the
instance configuration information—the launch template and instance types. The policy
can also include a weight for each instance type and different launch templates for
certain instance types. For more information, see [Auto Scaling\
groups with multiple instance types and purchase options](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups.md) in the
