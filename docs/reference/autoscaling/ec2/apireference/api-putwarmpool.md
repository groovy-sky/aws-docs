# PutWarmPool

Creates or updates a warm pool for the specified Auto Scaling group. A warm pool is a pool of
pre-initialized EC2 instances that sits alongside the Auto Scaling group. Whenever your
application needs to scale out, the Auto Scaling group can draw on the warm pool to meet its new
desired capacity.

This operation must be called from the Region in which the Auto Scaling group was
created.

You can view the instances in the warm pool using the [DescribeWarmPool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeWarmPool.html) API call.
If you are no longer using a warm pool, you can delete it by calling the [DeleteWarmPool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DeleteWarmPool.html) API.

For more information, see [Warm pools for\
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](../../../../services/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-warm-pools.md) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/CommonParameters.html).

**AutoScalingGroupName**

The name of the Auto Scaling group.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 255.

Pattern: `[\u0020-\uD7FF\uE000-\uFFFD\uD800\uDC00-\uDBFF\uDFFF\r\n\t]*`

Required: Yes

**InstanceReusePolicy**

Indicates whether instances in the Auto Scaling group can be returned to the warm pool on
scale in. The default is to terminate instances in the Auto Scaling group when the group scales
in.

Type: [InstanceReusePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_InstanceReusePolicy.html) object

Required: No

**MaxGroupPreparedCapacity**

Specifies the maximum number of instances that are allowed to be in the warm pool or
in any state except `Terminated` for the Auto Scaling group. This is an optional
property. Specify it only if you do not want the warm pool size to be determined by the
difference between the group's maximum capacity and its desired capacity.

###### Important

If a value for `MaxGroupPreparedCapacity` is not specified, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
launches and maintains the difference between the group's maximum capacity and its
desired capacity. If you specify a value for `MaxGroupPreparedCapacity`,
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the difference between the `MaxGroupPreparedCapacity` and
the desired capacity instead.

The size of the warm pool is dynamic. Only when
`MaxGroupPreparedCapacity` and `MinSize` are set to the
same value does the warm pool have an absolute size.

If the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group is higher than the
`MaxGroupPreparedCapacity`, the capacity of the warm pool is 0, unless
you specify a value for `MinSize`. To remove a value that you previously set,
include the property but specify -1 for the value.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of -1.

Required: No

**MinSize**

Specifies the minimum number of instances to maintain in the warm pool. This helps you
to ensure that there is always a certain number of warmed instances available to handle
traffic spikes. Defaults to 0 if not specified.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.

Required: No

**PoolState**

Sets the instance state to transition to after the lifecycle actions are complete.
Default is `Stopped`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `Stopped | Running | Hibernated`

Required: No

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/CommonErrors.html).

**InstanceRefreshInProgress**

The request failed because an active instance refresh already exists for the specified
Auto Scaling group.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**LimitExceeded**

You have already reached a limit for your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling resources
(for example, Auto Scaling groups, launch configurations, or lifecycle hooks). For more
information, see [DescribeAccountLimits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeAccountLimits.html).

**message**

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ResourceContention**

You already have a pending update to an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling resource (for example, an Auto Scaling group,
instance, or load balancer).

**message**

HTTP Status Code: 500
