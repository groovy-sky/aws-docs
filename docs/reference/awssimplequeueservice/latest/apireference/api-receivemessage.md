# ReceiveMessage

Retrieves one or more messages (up to 10), from the specified queue. Using the
`WaitTimeSeconds` parameter enables long-poll support. For more
information, see [Amazon SQS\
Long Polling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.

Short poll is the default behavior where a weighted random set of machines is sampled
on a `ReceiveMessage` call. Therefore, only the messages on the sampled
machines are returned. If the number of messages in the queue is small (fewer than
1,000), you most likely get fewer messages than you requested per
`ReceiveMessage` call. If the number of messages in the queue is
extremely small, you might not receive any messages in a particular
`ReceiveMessage` response. If this happens, repeat the request.

For each message returned, the response includes the following:

- The message body.

- An MD5 digest of the message body. For information about MD5, see [RFC1321](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt).

- The `MessageId` you received when you sent the message to the
queue.

- The receipt handle.

- The message attributes.

- An MD5 digest of the message attributes.

The receipt handle is the identifier you must provide when deleting the message. For
more information, see [Queue and Message Identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-message-identifiers.html) in the _Amazon SQS Developer_
_Guide_.

You can provide the `VisibilityTimeout` parameter in your request. The
parameter is applied to the messages that Amazon SQS returns in the response. If you don't
include the parameter, the overall visibility timeout for the queue is used for the
returned messages. The default visibility timeout for a queue is 30 seconds.

###### Note

In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write code that calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully.

**[MessageAttributeNames](#API_ReceiveMessage_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the message attribute, where _N_ is the index.

- The name can contain alphanumeric characters and the underscore
( `_`), hyphen ( `-`), and period
( `.`).

- The name is case-sensitive and must be unique among all attribute names for
the message.

or `Amazon.` (or any casing variants).

- The name must not start or end with a period ( `.`), and it should
not have periods in succession ( `..`).

- The name can be up to 256 characters long.

When using `ReceiveMessage`, you can send a list of attribute names to
receive, or you can return all of the attributes by specifying `All` or
`.*` in your request. You can also use all message attributes starting
with a prefix, for example `bar.*`.

**[QueueUrl](#API_ReceiveMessage_RequestSyntax)**

The URL of the Amazon SQS queue from which messages are received.

Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**[ReceiveRequestAttemptId](#API_ReceiveMessage_RequestSyntax)**

This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.

The token used for deduplication of `ReceiveMessage` calls. If a networking
issue occurs after a `ReceiveMessage` action, and instead of a response you
receive a generic error, it is possible to retry the same action with an identical
`ReceiveRequestAttemptId` to retrieve the same set of messages, even if
their visibility timeout has not yet expired.

- You can use `ReceiveRequestAttemptId` only for 5 minutes after a
`ReceiveMessage` action.

- When you set `FifoQueue`, a caller of the
`ReceiveMessage` action can provide a
`ReceiveRequestAttemptId` explicitly.

- It is possible to retry the `ReceiveMessage` action with the same
`ReceiveRequestAttemptId` if none of the messages have been
modified (deleted or had their visibility changes).

- During a visibility timeout, subsequent calls with the same
`ReceiveRequestAttemptId` return the same messages and receipt
handles. If a retry occurs within the deduplication interval, it resets the
visibility timeout. For more information, see [Visibility Timeout](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/sqs-visibility-timeout.md) in the _Amazon SQS Developer_
_Guide_.

###### Important

If a caller of the `ReceiveMessage` action still processes
messages when the visibility timeout expires and messages become visible,
another worker consuming from the same queue can receive the same messages
and therefore process duplicates. Also, if a consumer whose message
processing time is longer than the visibility timeout tries to delete the
processed messages, the action fails with an error.

To mitigate this effect, ensure that your application observes a safe
threshold before the visibility timeout expires and extend the visibility
timeout as necessary.

- While messages with a particular `MessageGroupId` are invisible,
no more messages belonging to the same `MessageGroupId` are returned
until the visibility timeout expires. You can still receive messages
with another `MessageGroupId` from your FIFO queue as long as they are visible.

- If a caller of `ReceiveMessage` can't track the
`ReceiveRequestAttemptId`, no retries work until the original
visibility timeout expires. As a result, delays might occur but the messages in
the queue remain in a strict order.

The maximum length of `ReceiveRequestAttemptId` is 128 characters.
`ReceiveRequestAttemptId` can contain alphanumeric characters
( `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`) and punctuation
( ``!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~``).

For best practices of using `ReceiveRequestAttemptId`, see [Using the ReceiveRequestAttemptId Request Parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-receiverequestattemptid-request-parameter.html) in the _Amazon SQS_
_Developer Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**[VisibilityTimeout](#API_ReceiveMessage_RequestSyntax)**

The duration (in seconds) that the received messages are hidden from subsequent
retrieve requests after being retrieved by a `ReceiveMessage` request. If not
specified, the default visibility timeout for the queue is used, which is 30
seconds.

Understanding `VisibilityTimeout`:

- When a message is received from a queue, it becomes temporarily invisible to
other consumers for the duration of the visibility timeout. This prevents
multiple consumers from processing the same message simultaneously. If the
message is not deleted or its visibility timeout is not extended before the
timeout expires, it becomes visible again and can be retrieved by other
consumers.

- Setting an appropriate visibility timeout is crucial. If it's too short, the
message might become visible again before processing is complete, leading to
duplicate processing. If it's too long, it delays the reprocessing of messages
if the initial processing fails.

- You can adjust the visibility timeout using the
`--visibility-timeout` parameter in the
`receive-message` command to match the processing time required
by your application.

- A message that isn't deleted or a message whose visibility isn't extended
before the visibility timeout expires counts as a failed receive. Depending on
the configuration of the queue, the message might be sent to the dead-letter
queue.

For more information, see [Visibility Timeout](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/sqs-visibility-timeout.md) in the _Amazon SQS Developer_
_Guide_.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**[WaitTimeSeconds](#API_ReceiveMessage_RequestSyntax)**

The duration (in seconds) for which the call waits for a message to arrive in the
queue before returning. If a message is available, the call returns sooner than
`WaitTimeSeconds`. If no messages are available and the wait time
expires, the call does not return a message list. If you are using the Java SDK, it
returns a `ReceiveMessageResponse` object, which has a empty list instead of
a Null object.

###### Important

To avoid HTTP errors, ensure that the HTTP response timeout for
`ReceiveMessage` requests is longer than the
`WaitTimeSeconds` parameter. For example, with the Java SDK, you can
set HTTP transport settings using the [NettyNioAsyncHttpClient](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/http/nio/netty/NettyNioAsyncHttpClient.html) for asynchronous clients, or the [ApacheHttpClient](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/http/apache/ApacheHttpClient.html) for synchronous clients.

Type: Integer

Required: No
