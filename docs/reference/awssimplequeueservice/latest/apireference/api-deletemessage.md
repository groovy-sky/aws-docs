# DeleteMessage

Deletes the specified message from the specified queue. To select the message to
delete, use the `ReceiptHandle` of the message ( _not_ the
`MessageId` which you receive when you send the message). Amazon SQS can
delete a message from a queue even if a visibility timeout setting causes the message to
be locked by another consumer. Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages left in a queue
longer than the retention period configured for the queue.

###### Note

Each time you receive a message, meaning when a consumer retrieves a message from
the queue, it comes with a unique `ReceiptHandle`. If you receive the
same message more than once, you will get a different `ReceiptHandle`
each time. When you want to delete a message using the `DeleteMessage`
action, you must use the `ReceiptHandle` from the most recent time you
received the message. If you use an old `ReceiptHandle`, the request will
succeed, but the message might not be deleted.

For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even after you
delete it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers which stores a
copy of the message is unavailable when you send the request to delete the message.
The copy remains on the server and might be returned to you during a subsequent
receive request. You should ensure that your application is idempotent, so that
receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.
