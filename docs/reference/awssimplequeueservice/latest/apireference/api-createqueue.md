# CreateQueue

Creates a new standard or FIFO queue. You can pass one or more attributes in
the request. Keep the following in mind:

- If you don't specify the `FifoQueue` attribute, Amazon SQS creates a standard queue.

###### Note

You can't change the queue type after you create it and you can't convert
an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue. You must either create a new
FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing standard queue and
recreate it as a FIFO queue. For more information, see [Moving From a standard queue to a FIFO queue](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/fifo-queues-fifo-queues-moving.md) in the
_Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.

- If you don't provide a value for an attribute, the queue is created with the
default value for the attribute.

- If you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a
queue with the same name.

To successfully create a new queue, you must provide a queue name that adheres to the
[limits\
related to queues](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/limits-queues.md) and is unique within the scope of your queues.

###### Note

After you create a queue, you must wait at least one second after the queue is
created to be able to use the queue.

To retrieve the URL of a queue, use the [`GetQueueUrl`](api-getqueueurl.md) action. This action only requires the [`QueueName`](api-createqueue-api-createqueue-requestsyntax.md) parameter.

When creating queues, keep the following points in mind:

- If you specify the name of an existing queue and provide the exact same names
and values for all its attributes, the [`CreateQueue`](api-createqueue.md) action will return the URL of the
existing queue instead of creating a new one.

- If you attempt to create a queue with a name that already exists but with
different attribute names or values, the `CreateQueue` action will
return an error. This ensures that existing queues are not inadvertently
altered.

###### Note

Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information,
see [Grant \
cross-account permissions to a role and a username](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/sqs-customer-managed-policy-examples-grant-cross-account-permissions-to-role-and-user-name.md) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

{
   "Attributes": {
      "string" : "string"
   },
   "QueueName": "string",
   "tags": {
      "string" : "string"
   }
}
```

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[Attributes](#API_CreateQueue_RequestSyntax)**

A map of attributes with their corresponding values.

The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request
parameters that the `CreateQueue` action uses:

- `DelaySeconds` – The length of time, in seconds, for which the
delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An integer from
0 to 900 seconds (15 minutes). Default: 0.

- `MaximumMessageSize` – The limit of how many bytes a message
can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from 1,024 bytes
(1 KiB) to 1,048,576 bytes (1 MiB). Default: 1,048,576 bytes (1 MiB).

- `MessageRetentionPeriod` – The length of time, in seconds, for
which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer from 60 seconds (1
minute) to 1,209,600 seconds (14 days). Default: 345,600 (4 days). When you
change a queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of
the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the
`MessageRetentionPeriod` attribute can take up to 15 minutes and
will impact existing messages in the queue potentially causing them to be
expired and deleted if the `MessageRetentionPeriod` is reduced below
the age of existing messages.

- `Policy` – The queue's policy. A valid AWS policy. For more
information about policy structure, see [Overview of AWS IAM\
Policies](../../../../services/iam/latest/userguide/policiesoverview.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

- `ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds` – The length of time, in
seconds, for which a `
                             ReceiveMessage
                          ` action waits
for a message to arrive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds).
Default: 0.

- `VisibilityTimeout` – The visibility timeout for the queue, in
seconds. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). Default: 30. For
more information about the visibility timeout, see [Visibility Timeout](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/sqs-visibility-timeout.md) in the _Amazon SQS Developer_
_Guide_.

The following attributes apply only to [dead-letter queues:](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.md)

- `RedrivePolicy` – The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality
of the source queue as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:

- `deadLetterTargetArn` – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to
which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of `maxReceiveCount` is exceeded.

- `maxReceiveCount` – The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being
moved to the dead-letter queue. Default: 10. When the `ReceiveCount` for a message exceeds the `maxReceiveCount`
for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue.

- `RedriveAllowPolicy` – The string that includes the parameters for the permissions for the dead-letter
queue redrive permission and which source queues can specify dead-letter queues as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:

- `redrivePermission` – The permission type that defines which source queues can
specify the current queue as the dead-letter queue. Valid values are:

- `allowAll` – (Default) Any source queues in this AWS account in the same Region can
specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.

- `denyAll` – No source queues can specify this queue as the dead-letter
queue.

- `byQueue` – Only queues specified by the `sourceQueueArns` parameter can specify
this queue as the dead-letter queue.

- `sourceQueueArns` – The Amazon Resource Names (ARN)s of the source queues that can specify
this queue as the dead-letter queue and redrive messages. You can specify this parameter only when the
`redrivePermission` parameter is set to `byQueue`. You can specify up to 10 source queue ARNs.
To allow more than 10 source queues to specify dead-letter queues, set the `redrivePermission` parameter
to `allowAll`.

###### Note

The dead-letter queue of a
FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter
queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.

The following attributes apply only to [server-side-encryption](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/sqs-server-side-encryption.md):

- `KmsMasterKeyId` – The ID of an AWS managed customer master
key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see [Key Terms](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/sqs-server-side-encryption.md#sqs-sse-key-terms). While the alias of the AWS managed CMK for Amazon SQS is
always `alias/aws/sqs`, the alias of a custom CMK can, for example,
be `alias/MyAlias
                          `. For more examples, see
[KeyId](../../../kms/latest/apireference/api-describekey-api-describekey-requestparameters.md) in the _AWS Key Management Service API_
_Reference_.

- `KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds` – The length of time, in
seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a [data key](../../../../services/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts-data-keys.md) to
encrypt or decrypt messages before calling AWS KMS again. An integer
representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24
hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better security
but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges after Free Tier. For
more information, see [How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work?](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/sqs-server-side-encryption.md#sqs-how-does-the-data-key-reuse-period-work)

- `SqsManagedSseEnabled` – Enables server-side queue encryption
using SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption option is
supported per queue (for example, [SSE-KMS](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/sqs-configure-sse-existing-queue.md) or [SSE-SQS](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/sqs-configure-sqs-sse-queue.md)).

The following attributes apply only to [FIFO (first-in-first-out)\
queues](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/fifo-queues.md):

- `FifoQueue` – Designates a queue as FIFO. Valid values are
`true` and `false`. If you don't specify the `FifoQueue` attribute, Amazon SQS creates a standard queue. You
can provide this attribute only during queue creation. You can't change it for
an existing queue. When you set this attribute, you must also provide the
`MessageGroupId` for your messages explicitly.

For more information, see [FIFO queue logic](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/fifo-queues-understanding-logic.md) in the _Amazon SQS Developer_
_Guide_.

- `ContentBasedDeduplication` – Enables content-based
deduplication. Valid values are `true` and `false`. For
more information, see [Exactly-once processing](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/fifo-queues-exactly-once-processing.md) in the _Amazon SQS Developer_
_Guide_. Note the following:

- Every message must have a unique
`MessageDeduplicationId`.

- You may provide a `MessageDeduplicationId`
explicitly.

- If you aren't able to provide a
`MessageDeduplicationId` and you enable
`ContentBasedDeduplication` for your queue, Amazon SQS
uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the
`MessageDeduplicationId` using the body of the
message (but not the attributes of the message).

- If you don't provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and
the queue doesn't have `ContentBasedDeduplication`
set, the action fails with an error.

- If the queue has `ContentBasedDeduplication` set,
your `MessageDeduplicationId` overrides the generated
one.

- When `ContentBasedDeduplication` is in effect, messages
with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are
treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is
delivered.

- If you send one message with `ContentBasedDeduplication`
enabled and then another message with a
`MessageDeduplicationId` that is the same as the one
generated for the first `MessageDeduplicationId`, the two
messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is
delivered.

The following attributes apply only to
[high throughput\
for FIFO queues](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/high-throughput-fifo.md):

- `DeduplicationScope` – Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the
message group or queue level. Valid values are `messageGroup` and `queue`.

- `FifoThroughputLimit` – Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput
quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are `perQueue` and `perMessageGroupId`.
The `perMessageGroupId` value is allowed only when the value for `DeduplicationScope` is `messageGroup`.

To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:

- Set `DeduplicationScope` to `messageGroup`.

- Set `FifoThroughputLimit` to `perMessageGroupId`.

If you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high
throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified.

For information on throughput quotas,
see [Quotas related to messages](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/quotas-messages.md)
in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.

Type: String to string map

Valid Keys: `All | Policy | VisibilityTimeout | MaximumMessageSize | MessageRetentionPeriod | ApproximateNumberOfMessages | ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible | CreatedTimestamp | LastModifiedTimestamp | QueueArn | ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed | DelaySeconds | ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds | RedrivePolicy | FifoQueue | ContentBasedDeduplication | KmsMasterKeyId | KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds | DeduplicationScope | FifoThroughputLimit | RedriveAllowPolicy | SqsManagedSseEnabled`

Required: No

**[QueueName](#API_CreateQueue_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the new queue. The following limits apply to this name:

- A queue name can have up to 80 characters.

- Valid values: alphanumeric characters, hyphens ( `-`), and
underscores ( `_`).

- A FIFO queue name must end with the `.fifo` suffix.

Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**[tags](#API_CreateQueue_RequestSyntax)**

Add cost allocation tags to the specified Amazon SQS queue. For an overview, see [Tagging \
Your Amazon SQS Queues](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/sqs-queue-tags.md) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.

When you use queue tags, keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Adding more than 50 tags to a queue isn't recommended.

- Tags don't have any semantic meaning. Amazon SQS interprets tags as character strings.

- Tags are case-sensitive.

- A new tag with a key identical to that of an existing tag overwrites the existing tag.

For a full list of tag restrictions, see
[Quotas related to queues](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/sqs-limits-limits-queues.md)
in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.

###### Note

To be able to tag a queue on creation, you must have the
`sqs:CreateQueue` and `sqs:TagQueue` permissions.

Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information,
see [Grant \
cross-account permissions to a role and a username](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/sqs-customer-managed-policy-examples-grant-cross-account-permissions-to-role-and-user-name.md) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.
