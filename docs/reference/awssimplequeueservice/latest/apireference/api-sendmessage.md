# SendMessage

Delivers a message to the specified queue.

###### Important

A message can include only XML, JSON, and unformatted text. The following Unicode characters are allowed. For more information, see the [W3C specification for characters](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml).

`#x9` \| `#xA` \| `#xD` \| `#x20` to `#xD7FF` \| `#xE000` to `#xFFFD` \| `#x10000` to `#x10FFFF`

If a message contains characters outside the allowed set, Amazon SQS rejects the message and returns an InvalidMessageContents error. Ensure that your message body includes only valid characters to avoid this exception.

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[DelaySeconds](#API_SendMessage_RequestSyntax)**

The length of time, in seconds, for which to delay a specific message. Valid values:
0 to 900. Maximum: 15 minutes. Messages with a positive `DelaySeconds` value
become available for processing after the delay period is finished. If you don't specify
a value, the default value for the queue applies.

###### Note

When you set `FifoQueue`, you can't set `DelaySeconds` per message. You can set this parameter only on a queue level.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**[MessageAttributes](#API_SendMessage_RequestSyntax)**

Each message attribute consists of a `Name`, `Type`,
and `Value`. For more information, see
[Amazon SQS \
message attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-message-metadata.html#sqs-message-attributes) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.

Type: String to [MessageAttributeValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_MessageAttributeValue.html) object map

Required: No

**[MessageBody](#API_SendMessage_RequestSyntax)**

The message to send. The minimum size is one character. The maximum size is
1 MiB or 1,048,576 bytes

###### Important

A message can include only XML, JSON, and unformatted text. The following Unicode characters are allowed. For more information, see the [W3C specification for characters](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml).

`#x9` \| `#xA` \| `#xD` \| `#x20` to `#xD7FF` \| `#xE000` to `#xFFFD` \| `#x10000` to `#x10FFFF`

If a message contains characters outside the allowed set, Amazon SQS rejects the message and returns an InvalidMessageContents error. Ensure that your message body includes only valid characters to avoid this exception.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**[MessageDeduplicationId](#API_SendMessage_RequestSyntax)**

This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.

The token used for deduplication of sent messages. If a message with a particular
`MessageDeduplicationId` is sent successfully, any messages sent with the
same `MessageDeduplicationId` are accepted successfully but aren't delivered
during the 5-minute deduplication interval. For more information, see [Exactly-once processing](../../../../services/awssimplequeueservice/latest/sqsdeveloperguide/fifo-queues-exactly-once-processing.md) in the _Amazon SQS Developer_
_Guide_.

- Every message must have a unique `MessageDeduplicationId`,

- You may provide a `MessageDeduplicationId`
explicitly.

- If you aren't able to provide a `MessageDeduplicationId`
and you enable `ContentBasedDeduplication` for your queue,
Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the
`MessageDeduplicationId` using the body of the message
(but not the attributes of the message).

- If you don't provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and the
queue doesn't have `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, the
action fails with an error.

- If the queue has `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, your
`MessageDeduplicationId` overrides the generated
one.

- When `ContentBasedDeduplication` is in effect, messages with
identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as
duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.

- If you send one message with `ContentBasedDeduplication` enabled
and then another message with a `MessageDeduplicationId` that is the
same as the one generated for the first `MessageDeduplicationId`, the
two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is
delivered.

###### Note

The `MessageDeduplicationId` is available to the consumer of the
message (this can be useful for troubleshooting delivery issues).

If a message is sent successfully but the acknowledgement is lost and the message
is resent with the same `MessageDeduplicationId` after the deduplication
interval, Amazon SQS can't detect duplicate messages.

Amazon SQS continues to keep track of the message deduplication ID even after the message is received and deleted.

The maximum length of `MessageDeduplicationId` is 128 characters.
`MessageDeduplicationId` can contain alphanumeric characters
( `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`) and punctuation
( ``!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~``).

For best practices of using `MessageDeduplicationId`, see [Using the MessageDeduplicationId Property](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagededuplicationid-property.html) in the _Amazon SQS Developer_
_Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**[MessageGroupId](#API_SendMessage_RequestSyntax)**

`MessageGroupId` is an attribute used in Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) and standard queues.
In FIFO queues, `MessageGroupId` organizes messages into distinct groups.
Messages within the same message group are always processed one at a time, in strict order,
ensuring that no two messages from the same group are processed simultaneously.
In standard queues, using `MessageGroupId` enables fair queues.
It is used to identify the tenant a message belongs to,
helping maintain consistent message dwell time across all tenants during noisy neighbor events.
Unlike FIFO queues, messages with the same `MessageGroupId` can be processed in parallel,
maintaining the high throughput of standard queues.

- **FIFO queues:** `MessageGroupId` acts as the tag
that specifies that a message belongs to a specific message group.
Messages that belong to the same message group are processed in a FIFO manner
(however, messages in different message groups might be processed out of order).
To interleave multiple ordered streams within a single queue, use `MessageGroupId` values
(for example, session data for multiple users).
In this scenario, multiple consumers can process the queue,
but the session data of each user is processed in a FIFO fashion.

If you do not provide a `MessageGroupId` when sending a message to a FIFO queue, the action fails.

`ReceiveMessage` might return messages with multiple `MessageGroupId` values.
For each `MessageGroupId`, the messages are sorted by time sent.

- **Standard queues:** Use `MessageGroupId` in standard queues to enable fair queues.
The `MessageGroupId` identifies the tenant a message belongs to.
A tenant can be any entity that shares a queue with others, such as your customer, a client application,
or a request type. When one tenant sends a disproportionately large volume of messages
or has messages that require longer processing time, fair queues ensure other tenants'
messages maintain low dwell time. This preserves quality of service for all tenants while
maintaining the scalability and throughput of standard queues.
We recommend that you include a `MessageGroupId` in all messages when using fair queues.

The length of `MessageGroupId` is 128 characters. Valid values:
alphanumeric characters and punctuation
``(!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~)``.

For best practices of using `MessageGroupId`, see [Using the MessageGroupId Property](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagegroupid-property.html) in the _Amazon SQS Developer_
_Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**[MessageSystemAttributes](#API_SendMessage_RequestSyntax)**

The message system attribute to send. Each message system attribute consists of a `Name`, `Type`, and `Value`.

###### Important

- Currently, the only supported message system attribute is `AWSTraceHeader`.
Its type must be `String` and its value must be a correctly formatted
AWS X-Ray trace header string.

- The size of a message system attribute doesn't count towards the total size of a message.

Type: String to [MessageSystemAttributeValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_MessageSystemAttributeValue.html) object map

Valid Keys: `AWSTraceHeader`

Required: No

**[QueueUrl](#API_SendMessage_RequestSyntax)**

The URL of the Amazon SQS queue to which a message is sent.

Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

Type: String

Required: Yes

Type: String

**[MD5OfMessageSystemAttributes](#API_SendMessage_ResponseSyntax)**

An MD5 digest of the non-URL-encoded message system attribute string. You can use this
attribute to verify that Amazon SQS received the message correctly. Amazon SQS URL-decodes the message before creating the MD5 digest.

Type: String

**[MessageId](#API_SendMessage_ResponseSyntax)**

An attribute containing the `MessageId` of the message sent to the queue.
For more information, see [Queue and Message Identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-message-identifiers.html) in the _Amazon SQS Developer_
_Guide_.

Type: String

**[SequenceNumber](#API_SendMessage_ResponseSyntax)**

This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.
