# CreateGlobalTable

Creates a global table from an existing table. A global table creates a replication
relationship between two or more DynamoDB tables with the same table name in the
provided Regions.

###### Important

This documentation is for version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) of global tables, which should be avoided for new global tables. Customers should use [Global Tables version 2019.11.21 (Current)](../../../../services/dynamodb/latest/developerguide/globaltables.md) when possible, because it provides greater flexibility, higher efficiency, and consumes less write capacity than 2017.11.29 (Legacy).

To determine which version you're using, see [Determining the global table version you are using](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/globaltables.DetermineVersion.html). To update existing global tables from version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) to version 2019.11.21 (Current), see [Upgrading global tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/V2globaltables_upgrade.html).

If you want to add a new replica table to a global table, each of the following
conditions must be true:

- The table must have the same primary key as all of the other replicas.

- The table must have the same name as all of the other replicas.

- The table must have DynamoDB Streams enabled, with the stream containing both
the new and the old images of the item.

- None of the replica tables in the global table can contain any data.

If global secondary indexes are specified, then the following conditions must also be
met:

- The global secondary indexes must have the same name.

- The global secondary indexes must have the same hash key and sort key (if
present).

If local secondary indexes are specified, then the following conditions must also be
met:

- The local secondary indexes must have the same name.

- The local secondary indexes must have the same hash key and sort key (if
present).

###### Important

Write capacity settings should be set consistently across your replica tables and
secondary indexes. DynamoDB strongly recommends enabling auto scaling to manage the
write capacity settings for all of your global tables replicas and indexes.

If you prefer to manage write capacity settings manually, you should provision
equal replicated write capacity units to your replica tables. You should also
provision equal replicated write capacity units to matching secondary indexes across
your global table.

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[GlobalTableDescription](#API_CreateGlobalTable_ResponseSyntax)**

Contains the details of the global table.

Type: [GlobalTableDescription](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_GlobalTableDescription.html) object

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**GlobalTableAlreadyExistsException**

The specified global table already exists.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InternalServerError**

An error occurred on the server side.

**message**

The server encountered an internal error trying to fulfill the request.

HTTP Status Code: 500

**LimitExceededException**

There is no limit to the number of daily on-demand backups that can be taken.

For most purposes, up to 500 simultaneous table operations are allowed per account.
These operations include `CreateTable`, `UpdateTable`,
`DeleteTable`, `UpdateTimeToLive`,
`RestoreTableFromBackup`, and `RestoreTableToPointInTime`.

When you are creating a table with one or more secondary indexes, you can have up
to 250 such requests running at a time. However, if the table or index specifications
are complex, then DynamoDB might temporarily reduce the number of concurrent
operations.

When importing into DynamoDB, up to 50 simultaneous import table operations are
allowed per account.

There is a soft account quota of 2,500 tables.

GetRecords was called with a value of more than 1000 for the limit request
parameter.

More than 2 processes are reading from the same streams shard at the same time.
Exceeding this limit may result in request throttling.

**message**

Too many operations for a given subscriber.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**TableNotFoundException**

A source table with the name `TableName` does not currently exist within
the subscriber's account or the subscriber is operating in the wrong AWS
Region.

HTTP Status Code: 400
