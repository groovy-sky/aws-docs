# Tag

A description of a tag. Every tag is a key-value pair. You can add up to 50 tags to
a single DAX cluster.

AWS-assigned tag names and values are automatically assigned the
`aws:` prefix, which the user cannot assign. AWS-assigned
tag names do not count towards the tag limit of 50. User-assigned tag names have the
prefix `user:`.

You cannot backdate the application of a tag.

the existing tag value will be updated to the new value.
