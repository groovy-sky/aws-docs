# DeleteGlobalTableWitnessGroupMemberAction
<a name="API_DeleteGlobalTableWitnessGroupMemberAction"></a>

Specifies the action to remove a witness Region from a MRSC global table. You cannot delete a single witness from a MRSC global table - you must delete both a replica and the witness together. The deletion of both a witness and replica converts the remaining replica to a single-Region DynamoDB table.
