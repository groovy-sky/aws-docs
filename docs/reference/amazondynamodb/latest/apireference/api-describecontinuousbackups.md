# DescribeContinuousBackups
<a name="API_DescribeContinuousBackups"></a>

Checks the status of continuous backups and point in time recovery on the specified table. Continuous backups are `ENABLED` on all tables at table creation. If point in time recovery is enabled, `PointInTimeRecoveryStatus` will be set to ENABLED.

 After continuous backups and point in time recovery are enabled, you can restore to any point in time within `EarliestRestorableDateTime` and `LatestRestorableDateTime`.

 `LatestRestorableDateTime` is typically 5 minutes before the current time. You can restore your table to any point in time in the last 35 days. You can set the recovery period to any value between 1 and 35 days.

You can call `DescribeContinuousBackups` at a maximum rate of 10 times per second.
