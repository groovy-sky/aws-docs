# GetItem

The `GetItem` operation returns a set of attributes for the item with the
given primary key. If there is no matching item, `GetItem` does not return
any data and there will be no `Item` element in the response.

`GetItem` provides an eventually consistent read by default. If your
application requires a strongly consistent read, set `ConsistentRead` to
`true`. Although a strongly consistent read might take more time than an
eventually consistent read, it always returns the last updated value.

## Request Parameters

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

###### Note

In the following list, the required parameters are described first.

**[Key](#API_GetItem_RequestSyntax)**

A map of attribute names to `AttributeValue` objects, representing the
primary key of the item to retrieve.

For the primary key, you must provide all of the attributes. For example, with a
simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for the partition key. For a
composite primary key, you must provide values for both the partition key and the sort
key.

Type: String to [AttributeValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_AttributeValue.html) object map

Key Length Constraints: Maximum length of 65535.

Required: Yes

**[TableName](#API_GetItem_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the table containing the requested item. You can also provide the
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parameter.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

Required: Yes

**[AttributesToGet](#API_GetItem_RequestSyntax)**

This is a legacy parameter. Use `ProjectionExpression` instead. For more
information, see [AttributesToGet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/LegacyConditionalParameters.AttributesToGet.html) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer_
_Guide_.

Type: Array of strings

Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item.

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 65535.

Required: No

**[ConsistentRead](#API_GetItem_RequestSyntax)**

Determines the read consistency model: If set to `true`, then the operation
uses strongly consistent reads; otherwise, the operation uses eventually consistent
reads.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[ExpressionAttributeNames](#API_GetItem_RequestSyntax)**

One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following
are some use cases for using `ExpressionAttributeNames`:

- To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved
word.

- To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an
expression.

- To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted
in an expression.

Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference
an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name:

- `Percentile`

The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used
directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see [Reserved Words](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ReservedWords.html) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer_
_Guide_). To work around this, you could specify the following for
`ExpressionAttributeNames`:

- `{"#P":"Percentile"}`

You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:

- `#P = :val`

###### Note

Tokens that begin with the **:** character are
_expression attribute values_, which are placeholders for the
actual value at runtime.

For more information on expression attribute names, see [Specifying Item Attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.AccessingItemAttributes.html) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer_
_Guide_.

Type: String to string map

Value Length Constraints: Maximum length of 65535.

Required: No

**[ProjectionExpression](#API_GetItem_RequestSyntax)**

A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the table. These
attributes can include scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in
the expression must be separated by commas.

If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes are returned. If any of the
requested attributes are not found, they do not appear in the result.

For more information, see [Specifying Item Attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.AccessingItemAttributes.html) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer_
_Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**[ReturnConsumedCapacity](#API_GetItem_RequestSyntax)**

Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput
consumption that is returned in the response:

- `INDEXES` \- The response includes the aggregate
`ConsumedCapacity` for the operation, together with
`ConsumedCapacity` for each table and secondary index that was
accessed.

Note that some operations, such as `GetItem` and
`BatchGetItem`, do not access any indexes at all. In these cases,
specifying `INDEXES` will only return `ConsumedCapacity`
information for table(s).

- `TOTAL` \- The response includes only the aggregate
`ConsumedCapacity` for the operation.

- `NONE` \- No `ConsumedCapacity` details are included in the
response.

Type: String

Valid Values: `INDEXES | TOTAL | NONE`

Required: No

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[ConsumedCapacity](#API_GetItem_ResponseSyntax)**

The capacity units consumed by the `GetItem` operation. The data returned
includes the total provisioned throughput consumed, along with statistics for the table
and any indexes involved in the operation. `ConsumedCapacity` is only
returned if the `ReturnConsumedCapacity` parameter was specified. For more
information, see [Capacity unit consumption for read operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/read-write-operations.html#read-operation-consumption) in the _Amazon_
_DynamoDB Developer Guide_.

Type: [ConsumedCapacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_ConsumedCapacity.html) object

**[Item](#API_GetItem_ResponseSyntax)**

A map of attribute names to `AttributeValue` objects, as specified by
`ProjectionExpression`.

Type: String to [AttributeValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_AttributeValue.html) object map

Key Length Constraints: Maximum length of 65535.

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**InternalServerError**

An error occurred on the server side.

**message**

The server encountered an internal error trying to fulfill the request.

HTTP Status Code: 500

**ProvisionedThroughputExceededException**

The request was denied due to request throttling. For detailed information about
why the request was throttled and the ARN of the impacted resource, find the [ThrottlingReason](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_ThrottlingReason.html) field in the returned exception. The AWS
SDKs for DynamoDB automatically retry requests that receive this exception.
Your request is eventually successful, unless your retry queue is too large to finish.
Reduce the frequency of requests and use exponential backoff. For more information, go
to [Error Retries and Exponential Backoff](../../../../services/dynamodb/latest/developerguide/programming-errors.md#Programming.Errors.RetryAndBackoff) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide_.

**message**

You exceeded your maximum allowed provisioned throughput.

Throughput exceeds the current throughput quota for your account. For detailed
information about why the request was throttled and the ARN of the impacted resource,
find the [ThrottlingReason](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_ThrottlingReason.html) field in the returned exception. Contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support) to request a quota
increase.

## Examples

### Retrieve Item Attributes

The following example retrieves three attributes from the `Thread`
table. In the response, the `ConsumedCapacityUnits` value is 1,
because `ConsistentRead` is set to true. If
`ConsistentRead` had been set to false (or not specified) for the
same request, an eventually consistent read would have been used and
`ConsumedCapacityUnits` would have been 0.5.
