# ListBackups
<a name="API_ListBackups"></a>

List DynamoDB backups that are associated with an AWS account and weren't made with AWS Backup. To list these backups for a given table, specify `TableName`. `ListBackups` returns a paginated list of results with at most 1 MB worth of items in a page. You can also specify a maximum number of entries to be returned in a page.

In the request, start time is inclusive, but end time is exclusive. Note that these boundaries are for the time at which the original backup was requested.

You can call `ListBackups` a maximum of five times per second.

If you want to retrieve the complete list of backups made with AWS Backup, use the [AWS Backup list API.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_ListBackupJobs.html)

## Response Elements
<a name="API_ListBackups_ResponseElements"></a>

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

 ** [BackupSummaries](#API_ListBackups_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="DDB-ListBackups-response-BackupSummaries"></a>
List of `BackupSummary` objects.

 The ARN of the backup last evaluated when the current page of results was returned, inclusive of the current page of results. This value may be specified as the `ExclusiveStartBackupArn` of a new `ListBackups` operation in order to fetch the next page of results.
 If `LastEvaluatedBackupArn` is empty, then the last page of results has been processed and there are no more results to be retrieved.
 If `LastEvaluatedBackupArn` is not empty, this may or may not indicate that there is more data to be returned. All results are guaranteed to have been returned if and only if no value for `LastEvaluatedBackupArn` is returned.
