# TransactWriteItems

`TransactWriteItems` is a synchronous write operation that groups up to 100
action requests. These actions can target items in different tables, but not in
different AWS accounts or Regions, and no two actions can target the same
item. For example, you cannot both `ConditionCheck` and `Update`
the same item. The aggregate size of the items in the transaction cannot exceed 4
MB.

The actions are completed atomically so that either all of them succeed, or all of
them fail. They are defined by the following objects:

- `Put`  —   Initiates a `PutItem`
operation to write a new item. This structure specifies the primary key of the
item to be written, the name of the table to write it in, an optional condition
expression that must be satisfied for the write to succeed, a list of the item's
attributes, and a field indicating whether to retrieve the item's attributes if
the condition is not met.

- `Update`  —   Initiates an `UpdateItem`
operation to update an existing item. This structure specifies the primary key
of the item to be updated, the name of the table where it resides, an optional
condition expression that must be satisfied for the update to succeed, an
expression that defines one or more attributes to be updated, and a field
indicating whether to retrieve the item's attributes if the condition is not
met.

- `Delete`  —   Initiates a `DeleteItem`
operation to delete an existing item. This structure specifies the primary key
of the item to be deleted, the name of the table where it resides, an optional
condition expression that must be satisfied for the deletion to succeed, and a
field indicating whether to retrieve the item's attributes if the condition is
not met.

- `ConditionCheck`  —   Applies a condition to an item
that is not being modified by the transaction. This structure specifies the
primary key of the item to be checked, the name of the table where it resides, a
condition expression that must be satisfied for the transaction to succeed, and
a field indicating whether to retrieve the item's attributes if the condition is
not met.

DynamoDB rejects the entire `TransactWriteItems` request if any of the
following is true:

- A condition in one of the condition expressions is not met.

- An ongoing operation is in the process of updating the same item.

- There is insufficient provisioned capacity for the transaction to be
completed.

- An item size becomes too large (bigger than 400 KB), a local secondary index
(LSI) becomes too large, or a similar validation error occurs because of changes
made by the transaction.

- The aggregate size of the items in the transaction exceeds 4 MB.

- There is a user error, such as an invalid data format.

## Request Parameters

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

###### Note

In the following list, the required parameters are described first.

**[TransactItems](#API_TransactWriteItems_RequestSyntax)**

An ordered array of up to 100 `TransactWriteItem` objects, each of which
contains a `ConditionCheck`, `Put`, `Update`, or
`Delete` object. These can operate on items in different tables, but the
tables must reside in the same AWS account and Region, and no two of them
can operate on the same item.

Type: Array of [TransactWriteItem](api-transactwriteitem.md) objects

Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number of 100 items.

Required: Yes

**[ClientRequestToken](#API_TransactWriteItems_RequestSyntax)**

Providing a `ClientRequestToken` makes the call to
`TransactWriteItems` idempotent, meaning that multiple identical calls
have the same effect as one single call.

Although multiple identical calls using the same client request token produce the same
result on the server (no side effects), the responses to the calls might not be the
same. If the `ReturnConsumedCapacity` parameter is set, then the initial
`TransactWriteItems` call returns the amount of write capacity units
consumed in making the changes. Subsequent `TransactWriteItems` calls with
the same client token return the number of read capacity units consumed in reading the
item.

A client request token is valid for 10 minutes after the first request that uses it is
completed. After 10 minutes, any request with the same client token is treated as a new
request. Do not resubmit the same request with the same client token for more than 10
minutes, or the result might not be idempotent.

If you submit a request with the same client token but a change in other parameters
within the 10-minute idempotency window, DynamoDB returns an
`IdempotentParameterMismatch` exception.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 36.

Required: No

**[ReturnConsumedCapacity](#API_TransactWriteItems_RequestSyntax)**

Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput
consumption that is returned in the response:

- `INDEXES` \- The response includes the aggregate
`ConsumedCapacity` for the operation, together with
`ConsumedCapacity` for each table and secondary index that was
accessed.

Note that some operations, such as `GetItem` and
`BatchGetItem`, do not access any indexes at all. In these cases,
specifying `INDEXES` will only return `ConsumedCapacity`
information for table(s).

- `TOTAL` \- The response includes only the aggregate
`ConsumedCapacity` for the operation.

- `NONE` \- No `ConsumedCapacity` details are included in the
response.

Type: String

Valid Values: `INDEXES | TOTAL | NONE`

Required: No

**[ReturnItemCollectionMetrics](#API_TransactWriteItems_RequestSyntax)**

Determines whether item collection metrics are returned. If set to `SIZE`,
the response includes statistics about item collections (if any), that were modified
during the operation and are returned in the response. If set to `NONE` (the
default), no statistics are returned.

Type: String

Valid Values: `SIZE | NONE`

Required: No

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[ConsumedCapacity](#API_TransactWriteItems_ResponseSyntax)**

The capacity units consumed by the entire `TransactWriteItems` operation.
The values of the list are ordered according to the ordering of the
`TransactItems` request parameter.

Type: Array of [ConsumedCapacity](api-consumedcapacity.md) objects

**[ItemCollectionMetrics](#API_TransactWriteItems_ResponseSyntax)**

A list of tables that were processed by `TransactWriteItems` and, for each
table, information about any item collections that were affected by individual
`UpdateItem`, `PutItem`, or `DeleteItem`
operations.

Type: String to array of [ItemCollectionMetrics](api-itemcollectionmetrics.md) objects map

Key Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**IdempotentParameterMismatchException**

DynamoDB rejected the request because you retried a request with a
different payload but with an idempotent token that was already used.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InternalServerError**

An error occurred on the server side.

**message**

The server encountered an internal error trying to fulfill the request.

HTTP Status Code: 500

**ProvisionedThroughputExceededException**

The request was denied due to request throttling. For detailed information about
why the request was throttled and the ARN of the impacted resource, find the [ThrottlingReason](api-throttlingreason.md) field in the returned exception. The AWS
SDKs for DynamoDB automatically retry requests that receive this exception.
Your request is eventually successful, unless your retry queue is too large to finish.
Reduce the frequency of requests and use exponential backoff. For more information, go
to [Error Retries and Exponential Backoff](../../../../services/dynamodb/latest/developerguide/programming-errors.md#Programming.Errors.RetryAndBackoff) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide_.

**message**

You exceeded your maximum allowed provisioned throughput.

**ThrottlingReasons**

A list of [ThrottlingReason](api-throttlingreason.md) that
provide detailed diagnostic information about why the request was throttled.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**RequestLimitExceeded**

Throughput exceeds the current throughput quota for your account. For detailed
information about why the request was throttled and the ARN of the impacted resource,
find the [ThrottlingReason](api-throttlingreason.md) field in the returned exception. Contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support) to request a quota
increase.

**ThrottlingReasons**

A list of [ThrottlingReason](api-throttlingreason.md) that
provide detailed diagnostic information about why the request was throttled.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ResourceNotFoundException**

The operation tried to access a nonexistent table or index. The resource might not
be specified correctly, or its status might not be `ACTIVE`.

**message**

The resource which is being requested does not exist.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ThrottlingException**

The request was denied due to request throttling. For detailed information about why
the request was throttled and the ARN of the impacted resource, find the [ThrottlingReason](api-throttlingreason.md) field in the returned exception.

**throttlingReasons**

A list of [ThrottlingReason](api-throttlingreason.md) that
provide detailed diagnostic information about why the request was throttled.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**TransactionCanceledException**

The entire transaction request was canceled.

DynamoDB cancels a `TransactWriteItems` request under the following
circumstances:

- A condition in one of the condition expressions is not met.

- A table in the `TransactWriteItems` request is in a different
account or region.

- More than one action in the `TransactWriteItems` operation
targets the same item.

- There is insufficient provisioned capacity for the transaction to be
completed.

- An item size becomes too large (larger than 400 KB), or a local secondary
index (LSI) becomes too large, or a similar validation error occurs because of
changes made by the transaction.

- There is a user error, such as an invalid data format.

- There is an ongoing `TransactWriteItems` operation that
conflicts with a concurrent `TransactWriteItems` request. In this
case the `TransactWriteItems` operation fails with a
`TransactionCanceledException`.

DynamoDB cancels a `TransactGetItems` request under the
following circumstances:

- There is an ongoing `TransactGetItems` operation that conflicts
with a concurrent `PutItem`, `UpdateItem`,
`DeleteItem` or `TransactWriteItems` request. In this
case the `TransactGetItems` operation fails with a
`TransactionCanceledException`.

- A table in the `TransactGetItems` request is in a different
account or region.

- There is insufficient provisioned capacity for the transaction to be
completed.

- There is a user error, such as an invalid data format.

###### Note

DynamoDB lists the cancellation reasons on the
`CancellationReasons` property. Transaction cancellation reasons are ordered in the order of requested
items, if an item has no error it will have `None` code and
`Null` message.

Cancellation reason codes and possible error messages:

- No Errors:

- Code: `None`

- Message: `null`

- Conditional Check Failed:

- Code: `ConditionalCheckFailed`

- Message: The conditional request failed.

- Item Collection Size Limit Exceeded:

- Code: `ItemCollectionSizeLimitExceeded`

- Message: Collection size exceeded.

- Transaction Conflict:

- Code: `TransactionConflict`

- Message: Transaction is ongoing for the item.

- Provisioned Throughput Exceeded:

- Code: `ProvisionedThroughputExceeded`

- Messages:

- The level of configured provisioned throughput for the
table was exceeded. Consider increasing your provisioning level
with the UpdateTable API.

###### Note

This Message is received when provisioned throughput is
exceeded is on a provisioned DynamoDB
table.

- The level of configured provisioned throughput for one or
more global secondary indexes of the table was exceeded.
Consider increasing your provisioning level for the
under-provisioned global secondary indexes with the UpdateTable
API.

###### Note

This message is returned when provisioned throughput is
exceeded is on a provisioned GSI.

- Throttling Error:

- Code: `ThrottlingError`

- Messages:

- Throughput exceeds the current capacity of your table or
index. DynamoDB is automatically scaling your table or
index so please try again shortly. If exceptions persist, check
if you have a hot key:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-partition-key-design.html.

###### Note

This message is returned when writes get throttled on an
On-Demand table as DynamoDB is automatically
scaling the table.

- An operand in the update expression has an incorrect data
type.

- Item size to update has exceeded the maximum allowed
size.

- Number overflow. Attempting to store a number with
magnitude larger than supported range.

**TransactionInProgressException**

The transaction with the given request token is already in progress.

Recommended Settings

###### Note

This is a general recommendation for handling the
`TransactionInProgressException`. These settings help ensure that the
client retries will trigger completion of the ongoing
`TransactWriteItems` request.

- Set `clientExecutionTimeout` to a value that allows at least one
retry to be processed after 5 seconds have elapsed since the first attempt for
the `TransactWriteItems` operation.

- Set `socketTimeout` to a value a little lower than the
`requestTimeout` setting.

- `requestTimeout` should be set based on the time taken for the
individual retries of a single HTTP request for your use case, but setting it to
1 second or higher should work well to reduce chances of retries and
`TransactionInProgressException` errors.

- Use exponential backoff when retrying and tune backoff if needed.

Assuming [default retry policy](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/fd409dee8ae23fb8953e0bb4dbde65536a7e0514/aws-java-sdk-core/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/retry/PredefinedRetryPolicies.java), example timeout settings based on the guidelines
above are as follows:

Example timeline:

- 0-1000 first attempt

- 1000-1500 first sleep/delay (default retry policy uses 500 ms as base delay
for 4xx errors)

- 1500-2500 second attempt

- 2500-3500 second sleep/delay (500 \* 2, exponential backoff)

- 3500-4500 third attempt

- 4500-6500 third sleep/delay (500 \* 2^2)

- 6500-7500 fourth attempt (this can trigger inline recovery since 5 seconds
have elapsed since the first attempt reached TC)

HTTP Status Code: 400
