# BatchWriteItem

The `BatchWriteItem` operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or
more tables. A single call to `BatchWriteItem` can transmit up to 16MB of
data over the network, consisting of up to 25 item put or delete operations. While
individual items can be up to 400 KB once stored, it's important to note that an item's
representation might be greater than 400KB while being sent in DynamoDB's JSON format
for the API call. For more details on this distinction, see [Naming Rules and Data Types](../../../../services/dynamodb/latest/developerguide/howitworks-namingrulesdatatypes.md).

###### Note

`BatchWriteItem` cannot update items. If you perform a
`BatchWriteItem` operation on an existing item, that item's values
will be overwritten by the operation and it will appear like it was updated. To
update items, we recommend you use the `UpdateItem` action.

The individual `PutItem` and `DeleteItem` operations specified
in `BatchWriteItem` are atomic; however `BatchWriteItem` as a
whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the table's provisioned
throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations
are returned in the `UnprocessedItems` response parameter. You can
investigate and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call
`BatchWriteItem` in a loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed
items and submit a new `BatchWriteItem` request with those unprocessed items
until all items have been processed.

For tables and indexes with provisioned capacity, if none of the items can be
processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the
request, then `BatchWriteItem` returns a
`ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. For all tables and indexes, if
none of the items can be processed due to other throttling scenarios (such as exceeding
partition level limits), then `BatchWriteItem` returns a
`ThrottlingException`.

###### Important

If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on
those items. However, _we strongly recommend that you use an exponential_
_backoff algorithm_. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the
underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual
tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual
requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.

For more information, see [Batch Operations and Error Handling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#Programming.Errors.BatchOperations) in the _Amazon DynamoDB_
_Developer Guide_.

With `BatchWriteItem`, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts of
data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data from another database into DynamoDB. In
order to improve performance with these large-scale operations,
`BatchWriteItem` does not behave in the same way as individual
`PutItem` and `DeleteItem` calls would. For example, you
cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete requests, and
`BatchWriteItem` does not return deleted items in the response.

If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use threads to
write items in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to manage the
threads. With languages that don't support threading, you must update or delete the
specified items one at a time. In both situations, `BatchWriteItem` performs
the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of the thread
pool approach without having to introduce complexity into your application.

Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request
consumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is processed in parallel or
not. Delete operations on nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit.

If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write
operation:

- One or more tables specified in the `BatchWriteItem` request does
not exist.

- Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match those
in the corresponding table's primary key schema.

- You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same
`BatchWriteItem` request. For example, you cannot put and delete
the same item in the same `BatchWriteItem` request.

- Your request contains at least two items with identical hash and range keys
(which essentially is two put operations).

- There are more than 25 requests in the batch.

- Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB.

- The total request size exceeds 16 MB.

- Any individual items with keys exceeding the key length limits. For a
partition key, the limit is 2048 bytes and for a sort key, the limit is 1024
bytes.

## Request Parameters

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

###### Note

In the following list, the required parameters are described first.

**[RequestItems](#API_BatchWriteItem_RequestSyntax)**

A map of one or more table names or table ARNs and, for each table, a list of
operations to be performed ( `DeleteRequest` or `PutRequest`). Each
element in the map consists of the following:

- `DeleteRequest` \- Perform a `DeleteItem` operation on the
specified item. The item to be deleted is identified by a `Key`
subelement:

- `Key` \- A map of primary key attribute values that uniquely
identify the item. Each entry in this map consists of an attribute name
and an attribute value. For each primary key, you must provide
_all_ of the key attributes. For example, with a
simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for the partition
key. For a composite primary key, you must provide values for
_both_ the partition key and the sort key.

- `PutRequest` \- Perform a `PutItem` operation on the
specified item. The item to be put is identified by an `Item`
subelement:

- `Item` \- A map of attributes and their values. Each entry in
this map consists of an attribute name and an attribute value. Attribute
values must not be null; string and binary type attributes must have
lengths greater than zero; and set type attributes must not be empty.
Requests that contain empty values are rejected with a
`ValidationException` exception.

If you specify any attributes that are part of an index key, then the
data types for those attributes must match those of the schema in the
table's attribute definition.

Type: String to array of [WriteRequest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_WriteRequest.html) objects map

Map Entries: Maximum number of 25 items.

Key Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number of 25 items.

Required: Yes

**[ReturnConsumedCapacity](#API_BatchWriteItem_RequestSyntax)**

Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput
consumption that is returned in the response:

- `INDEXES` \- The response includes the aggregate
`ConsumedCapacity` for the operation, together with
`ConsumedCapacity` for each table and secondary index that was
accessed.

Note that some operations, such as `GetItem` and
`BatchGetItem`, do not access any indexes at all. In these cases,
specifying `INDEXES` will only return `ConsumedCapacity`
information for table(s).

- `TOTAL` \- The response includes only the aggregate
`ConsumedCapacity` for the operation.

- `NONE` \- No `ConsumedCapacity` details are included in the
response.

Type: String

Valid Values: `INDEXES | TOTAL | NONE`

Required: No

**[ReturnItemCollectionMetrics](#API_BatchWriteItem_RequestSyntax)**

Determines whether item collection metrics are returned. If set to `SIZE`,
the response includes statistics about item collections, if any, that were modified
during the operation are returned in the response. If set to `NONE` (the
default), no statistics are returned.

Type: String

Valid Values: `SIZE | NONE`

Required: No

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[ConsumedCapacity](#API_BatchWriteItem_ResponseSyntax)**

The capacity units consumed by the entire `BatchWriteItem`
operation.

Each element consists of:

- `TableName` \- The table that consumed the provisioned
throughput.

- `CapacityUnits` \- The total number of capacity units consumed.

Type: Array of [ConsumedCapacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_ConsumedCapacity.html) objects

**[ItemCollectionMetrics](#API_BatchWriteItem_ResponseSyntax)**

A list of tables that were processed by `BatchWriteItem` and, for each
table, information about any item collections that were affected by individual
`DeleteItem` or `PutItem` operations.

Each entry consists of the following subelements:

- `ItemCollectionKey` \- The partition key value of the item collection.
This is the same as the partition key value of the item.

- `SizeEstimateRangeGB` \- An estimate of item collection size,
expressed in GB. This is a two-element array containing a lower bound and an
upper bound for the estimate. The estimate includes the size of all the items in
the table, plus the size of all attributes projected into all of the local
secondary indexes on the table. Use this estimate to measure whether a local
secondary index is approaching its size limit.

The estimate is subject to change over time; therefore, do not rely on the
precision or accuracy of the estimate.

Type: String to array of [ItemCollectionMetrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_ItemCollectionMetrics.html) objects map

Key Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

**[UnprocessedItems](#API_BatchWriteItem_ResponseSyntax)**

A map of tables and requests against those tables that were not processed. The
`UnprocessedItems` value is in the same form as
`RequestItems`, so you can provide this value directly to a subsequent
`BatchWriteItem` operation. For more information, see
`RequestItems` in the Request Parameters section.

Each `UnprocessedItems` entry consists of a table name or table ARN
and, for that table, a list of operations to perform ( `DeleteRequest` or
`PutRequest`).

- `DeleteRequest` \- Perform a `DeleteItem` operation on the
specified item. The item to be deleted is identified by a `Key`
subelement:

- `Key` \- A map of primary key attribute values that uniquely
identify the item. Each entry in this map consists of an attribute name
and an attribute value.

- `PutRequest` \- Perform a `PutItem` operation on the
specified item. The item to be put is identified by an `Item`
subelement:

- `Item` \- A map of attributes and their values. Each entry in
this map consists of an attribute name and an attribute value. Attribute
values must not be null; string and binary type attributes must have
lengths greater than zero; and set type attributes must not be empty.
Requests that contain empty values will be rejected with a
`ValidationException` exception.

If you specify any attributes that are part of an index key, then the
data types for those attributes must match those of the schema in the
table's attribute definition.

If there are no unprocessed items remaining, the response contains an empty
`UnprocessedItems` map.

Type: String to array of [WriteRequest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_WriteRequest.html) objects map

Map Entries: Maximum number of 25 items.

Key Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number of 25 items.

HTTP Status Code: 400

## Examples

### Multiple Operations on One Table

This example writes several items to the `Forum` table. The
response shows that the final put operation failed, possibly because the
application exceeded the provisioned throughput on the table. The
`UnprocessedItems` object shows the unsuccessful put request. The
application can call `BatchWriteItem` again to address such
unprocessed requests.
