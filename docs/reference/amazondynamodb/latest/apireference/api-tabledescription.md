# TableDescription

Represents the properties of a table.

## Contents

###### Note

In the following list, the required parameters are described first.

**ArchivalSummary**

Contains information about the table archive.

Type: [ArchivalSummary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_ArchivalSummary.html) object

Required: No

**AttributeDefinitions**

An array of `AttributeDefinition` objects. Each of these objects describes
one attribute in the table and index key schema.

Each `AttributeDefinition` object in this array is composed of:

- `AttributeName` \- The name of the attribute.

- `AttributeType` \- The data type for the attribute.

Type: Array of [AttributeDefinition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_AttributeDefinition.html) objects

Required: No

**BillingModeSummary**

Contains the details for the read/write capacity mode.

Type: [BillingModeSummary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_BillingModeSummary.html) object

Required: No

**CreationDateTime**

The date and time when the table was created, in [UNIX epoch time](http://www.epochconverter.com/) format.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**DeletionProtectionEnabled**

Indicates whether deletion protection is enabled (true) or disabled (false) on the
table.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**GlobalSecondaryIndexes**

The global secondary indexes, if any, on the table. Each index is scoped to a given
partition key value. Each element is composed of:

- `Backfilling` \- If true, then the index is currently in the
backfilling phase. Backfilling occurs only when a new global secondary index is
added to the table. It is the process by which DynamoDB populates the new index
with data from the table. (This attribute does not appear for indexes that were
created during a `CreateTable` operation.)

You can delete an index that is being created during the
`Backfilling` phase when `IndexStatus` is set to
CREATING and `Backfilling` is true. You can't delete the index that
is being created when `IndexStatus` is set to CREATING and
`Backfilling` is false. (This attribute does not appear for
indexes that were created during a `CreateTable` operation.)

- `IndexName` \- The name of the global secondary index.

- `IndexSizeBytes` \- The total size of the global secondary index, in
bytes. DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours. Recent changes
might not be reflected in this value.

- `IndexStatus` \- The current status of the global secondary
index:

- `CREATING` \- The index is being created.

- `UPDATING` \- The index is being updated.

- `DELETING` \- The index is being deleted.

- `ACTIVE` \- The index is ready for use.

- `ItemCount` \- The number of items in the global secondary index.
DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours. Recent changes might
not be reflected in this value.

- `KeySchema` \- Specifies the complete index key schema. The attribute
names in the key schema must be between 1 and 255 characters (inclusive). The
key schema must begin with the same partition key as the table.

- `Projection` \- Specifies attributes that are copied (projected) from
the table into the index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes
and index key attributes, which are automatically projected. Each attribute
specification is composed of:

- `ProjectionType` \- One of the following:

- `KEYS_ONLY` \- Only the index and primary keys are
projected into the index.

- `INCLUDE` \- In addition to the attributes described
in `KEYS_ONLY`, the secondary index will include
other non-key attributes that you specify.

- `ALL` \- All of the table attributes are projected
into the index.

- `NonKeyAttributes` \- A list of one or more non-key attribute
names that are projected into the secondary index. The total count of
attributes provided in `NonKeyAttributes`, summed across all
of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the same
attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct
attributes when determining the total. This limit only applies when you
specify the ProjectionType of `INCLUDE`. You still can
specify the ProjectionType of `ALL` to project all attributes
from the source table, even if the table has more than 100
attributes.

- `ProvisionedThroughput` \- The provisioned throughput settings for the
global secondary index, consisting of read and write capacity units, along with
data about increases and decreases.

If the table is in the `DELETING` state, no information about indexes will
be returned.

Type: Array of [GlobalSecondaryIndexDescription](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_GlobalSecondaryIndexDescription.html) objects

Required: No

**GlobalTableSettingsReplicationMode**

Indicates one of the settings synchronization modes for the global table:

- `ENABLED`: Indicates that the settings synchronization mode for the global table
is enabled.

- `DISABLED`: Indicates that the settings synchronization mode for the global table is
disabled.

- `ENABLED_WITH_OVERRIDES`: This mode is set by default for a same account global table.
Indicates that certain global table settings can be overridden.

Type: String

Valid Values: `ENABLED | DISABLED | ENABLED_WITH_OVERRIDES`

Required: No

**GlobalTableVersion**

Represents the version of [global tables](../../../../services/dynamodb/latest/developerguide/globaltables.md)
in use, if the table is replicated across AWS Regions.

Type: String

Required: No

**GlobalTableWitnesses**

Region can be configured per MRSC global table.

Type: Array of [GlobalTableWitnessDescription](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_GlobalTableWitnessDescription.html) objects

Required: No

**ItemCount**

The number of items in the specified table. DynamoDB updates this value approximately
every six hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.

Type: Long

Required: No

**KeySchema**

The primary key structure for the table. Each `KeySchemaElement` consists
of:

- `AttributeName` \- The name of the attribute.

- `KeyType` \- The role of the attribute:

- `HASH` \- partition key

- `RANGE` \- sort key

###### Note

The partition key of an item is also known as its _hash_
_attribute_. The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's
usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across
partitions, based on their partition key values.

The sort key of an item is also known as its _range_
_attribute_. The term "range attribute" derives from the way
DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together,
in sorted order by the sort key value.

For more information about primary keys, see [Primary Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DataModel.html#DataModelPrimaryKey) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer_
_Guide_.

Required: No

**LatestStreamLabel**

A timestamp, in ISO 8601 format, for this stream.

Note that `LatestStreamLabel` is not a unique identifier for the stream,
because it is possible that a stream from another table might have the same timestamp.
However, the combination of the following three elements is guaranteed to be
unique:

- AWS customer ID

- Table name

- `StreamLabel`

Type: String

Required: No

**LocalSecondaryIndexes**

Represents one or more local secondary indexes on the table. Each index is scoped to a
given partition key value. Tables with one or more local secondary indexes are subject
to an item collection size limit, where the amount of data within a given item
collection cannot exceed 10 GB. Each element is composed of:

- `IndexName` \- The name of the local secondary index.

- `KeySchema` \- Specifies the complete index key schema. The attribute
names in the key schema must be between 1 and 255 characters (inclusive). The
key schema must begin with the same partition key as the table.

- `Projection` \- Specifies attributes that are copied (projected) from
the table into the index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes
and index key attributes, which are automatically projected. Each attribute
specification is composed of:

- `ProjectionType` \- One of the following:

- `KEYS_ONLY` \- Only the index and primary keys are
projected into the index.

- `INCLUDE` \- Only the specified table attributes are
projected into the index. The list of projected attributes is in
`NonKeyAttributes`.

- `ALL` \- All of the table attributes are projected
into the index.

- `NonKeyAttributes` \- A list of one or more non-key attribute
names that are projected into the secondary index. The total count of
attributes provided in `NonKeyAttributes`, summed across all
of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the same
attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct
attributes when determining the total. This limit only applies when you
specify the ProjectionType of `INCLUDE`. You still can
specify the ProjectionType of `ALL` to project all attributes
from the source table, even if the table has more than 100
attributes.

- `IndexSizeBytes` \- Represents the total size of the index, in bytes.
DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours. Recent changes might
not be reflected in this value.

- `ItemCount` \- Represents the number of items in the index. DynamoDB
updates this value approximately every six hours. Recent changes might not be
reflected in this value.

If the table is in the `DELETING` state, no information about indexes will
be returned.
