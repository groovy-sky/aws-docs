# BatchExecuteStatement
<a name="API_BatchExecuteStatement"></a>

This operation allows you to perform batch reads or writes on data stored in DynamoDB, using PartiQL. Each read statement in a `BatchExecuteStatement` must specify an equality condition on all key attributes. This enforces that each `SELECT` statement in a batch returns at most a single item. For more information, see [Running batch operations with PartiQL for DynamoDB ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference.multiplestatements.batching.html).

**Note**
The entire batch must consist of either read statements or write statements, you cannot mix both in one batch.

**Important**
A HTTP 200 response does not mean that all statements in the BatchExecuteStatement succeeded. Error details for individual statements can be found under the [Error](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_BatchStatementResponse.html#DDB-Type-BatchStatementResponse-Error) field of the `BatchStatementResponse` for each statement.

## Request Parameters
<a name="API_BatchExecuteStatement_RequestParameters"></a>

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**Note**
In the following list, the required parameters are described first.

 ** [Statements](#API_BatchExecuteStatement_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="DDB-BatchExecuteStatement-request-Statements"></a>
The list of PartiQL statements representing the batch to run.
Type: Array of [BatchStatementRequest](API_BatchStatementRequest.md) objects
Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number of 25 items.
Required: Yes

 ** [ReturnConsumedCapacity](#API_BatchExecuteStatement_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="DDB-BatchExecuteStatement-request-ReturnConsumedCapacity"></a>
Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput consumption that is returned in the response:
+  `INDEXES` - The response includes the aggregate `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation, together with `ConsumedCapacity` for each table and secondary index that was accessed.

  Note that some operations, such as `GetItem` and `BatchGetItem`, do not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying `INDEXES` will only return `ConsumedCapacity` information for table(s).
+  `TOTAL` - The response includes only the aggregate `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation.
+  `NONE` - No `ConsumedCapacity` details are included in the response.
Type: String
Valid Values: `INDEXES | TOTAL | NONE`
Required: No
