# ThrottlingReason
<a name="API_ThrottlingReason"></a>

Represents the specific reason why a DynamoDB request was throttled and the ARN of the impacted resource. This helps identify exactly what resource is being throttled, what type of operation caused it, and why the throttling occurred.

**Note**
In the following list, the required parameters are described first.

 ** reason **   <a name="DDB-Type-ThrottlingReason-reason"></a>
The reason for throttling. The throttling reason follows a specific format: `ResourceType+OperationType+LimitType`:
+ Resource Type (What is being throttled): Table or Index
+ Operation Type (What kind of operation): Read or Write
+ Limit Type (Why the throttling occurred):
  +  `ProvisionedThroughputExceeded`: The request rate is exceeding the [provisioned throughput capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/provisioned-capacity-mode.html) (read or write capacity units) configured for a table or a global secondary index (GSI) in provisioned capacity mode.
  +  `AccountLimitExceeded`: The request rate has caused a table or global secondary index (GSI) in on-demand mode to exceed the [per-table account-level service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ServiceQuotas.html#default-limits-throughput) for read/write throughput in the current AWS Region.
  +  `KeyRangeThroughputExceeded`: The request rate directed at a specific partition key value has exceeded the [internal partition-level throughput limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-partition-key-design.html), indicating uneven access patterns across the table's or GSI's key space.
  +  `MaxOnDemandThroughputExceeded`: The request rate has exceeded the [configured maximum throughput limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/on-demand-capacity-mode-max-throughput.html) set for a table or index in on-demand capacity mode.
