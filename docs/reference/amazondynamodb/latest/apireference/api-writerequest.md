# WriteRequest
<a name="API_WriteRequest"></a>

Represents an operation to perform - either `DeleteItem` or `PutItem`. You can only request one of these operations, not both, in a single `WriteRequest`. If you do need to perform both of these operations, you need to provide two separate `WriteRequest` objects.
