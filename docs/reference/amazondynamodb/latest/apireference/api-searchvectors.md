# SearchVectors
<a name="API_SearchVectors"></a>

Performs a vector similarity search on a vector index associated with an Amazon DynamoDB table, and returns the most similar items sorted by similarity score based on the distance function configured for the index.

Score interpretation depends on the distance function:
+  `COSINE` - Returns the items with the *k smallest* scores. Scores range from 0 (identical) to 2 (opposite). Lower scores indicate higher similarity.
+  `EUCLIDEAN` - Returns the items with the *k smallest* scores. Scores represent the Euclidean distance between vectors. Lower scores indicate higher similarity.
+  `DOT_PRODUCT` - Returns the items with the *k highest* scores. Higher scores indicate higher similarity.

## Request Parameters
<a name="API_SearchVectors_RequestParameters"></a>

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**Note**
In the following list, the required parameters are described first.

 ** [IndexName](#API_SearchVectors_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="DDB-SearchVectors-request-IndexName"></a>
The name of the vector index to search. The index must be in the `ACTIVE` state.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 3. Maximum length of 255.
Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+`
Required: Yes

 ** [SearchVector](#API_SearchVectors_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="DDB-SearchVectors-request-SearchVector"></a>
The search vector to compare against the indexed vectors. Each element is a 32-bit IEEE-754 floating point number, provided in DynamoDB list format.
The number of dimensions must match the number of dimensions configured for the vector index.
Type: Array of [AttributeValue](API_AttributeValue.md) objects
Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number of 4096 items.
Required: Yes

 ** [TableName](#API_SearchVectors_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="DDB-SearchVectors-request-TableName"></a>
The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table containing the vector index.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.
Required: Yes

 ** [TopK](#API_SearchVectors_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="DDB-SearchVectors-request-TopK"></a>
The number of most similar results to return. Valid values range from 1 to 100, inclusive.
Type: Integer
Valid Range: Minimum value of 1.
Required: Yes

 ** [ExpressionAttributeNames](#API_SearchVectors_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="DDB-SearchVectors-request-ExpressionAttributeNames"></a>
One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. Use the `#` character in an expression to dereference an attribute name.
Type: String to string map
Value Length Constraints: Maximum length of 65535.
Required: No

 ** [ExpressionAttributeValues](#API_SearchVectors_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="DDB-SearchVectors-request-ExpressionAttributeValues"></a>
One or more values that can be substituted in an expression. Use the `:` character in an expression to dereference an attribute value.
Type: String to [AttributeValue](API_AttributeValue.md) object map
Required: No

 ** [ProjectionExpression](#API_SearchVectors_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="DDB-SearchVectors-request-ProjectionExpression"></a>
A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the index. Separate attribute names with commas. If not specified, the operation returns all attributes projected into the vector index.
Only attributes projected into the vector index can be retrieved.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** [ReturnConsumedCapacity](#API_SearchVectors_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="DDB-SearchVectors-request-ReturnConsumedCapacity"></a>
Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput consumption that is returned in the response:
+  `INDEXES` - The response includes the aggregate `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation, together with `ConsumedCapacity` for each table and secondary index that was accessed.

  Note that some operations, such as `GetItem` and `BatchGetItem`, do not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying `INDEXES` will only return `ConsumedCapacity` information for table(s).
+  `TOTAL` - The response includes only the aggregate `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation.
+  `NONE` - No `ConsumedCapacity` details are included in the response.
Type: String
Valid Values: `INDEXES | TOTAL | NONE`
Required: No

 ** [SearchConditionExpression](#API_SearchVectors_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="DDB-SearchVectors-request-SearchConditionExpression"></a>
A condition expression used to filter the vector search results. The expression can reference attributes defined in the vector index search schema, including `HASH` and `INLINE_FILTER` key elements.
The `HASH` and `INLINE_FILTER` attributes support only the equality operator (`=`). You can reference only top-level attributes from the search schema.
Type: String
Required: No
